107,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
108,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,It was six o'clock in the morning of last Thursday (Christmas
109,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"morning), when Nathan Stoddard, a young saddler, strode through the"
110,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"vacant streets of one of our New England towns, hastening to begin his"
111,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"work. The town is an old-fashioned one, and although the observance of"
112,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"the ancient church festival is no longer frowned upon, as in years"
113,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"past, yet it has been little regarded, especially in the church of"
114,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,which Nathan is a member. As the saddler mounted the steps of his
115,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"shop, he felt the blood so rush along his limbs, and tingle in his"
116,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"fingers, that he could not forbear standing without the door for a"
117,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"moment, as if to enjoy the triumph of the warmth within him over the"
118,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,cold morning air. The little stone church which Nathan attends stands
119,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"in the same square with his shop, and nearly opposite. It was closed,"
120,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"as usual on Christmas day, and a recent snow had heaped the steps and"
121,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"roof, and loaded the windows. Nathan thought that it looked uncommonly"
122,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,beautiful in the softening twilight of the morning.
123,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
124,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"While Nathan stood musing, with his eyes fixed upon the church, he"
125,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,became suddenly conscious that another figure had entered the square
126,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"upon the opposite side, and was walking hastily along. He turned his"
127,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"eyes upon it, and was greatly surprised by its appearance.  He saw a"
128,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"tall old man, although a good deal stooping, with long, straight, and"
129,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"very white hair falling over his shoulders, which was the more"
130,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"conspicuous from the black velvet cap, as it appeared, that he wore,"
131,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and the close-fitting suit of pure black in which he was dressed, and"
132,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,which seemed to Nathan almost to glisten and flash as the old man
133,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,tripped along. He had hardly begun to speculate as to who the stranger
134,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"could be, when he beheld him turn in between the posts by the path"
135,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"that leads to the church, tread lightly over the snow, and up the"
136,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"steps, and knock hastily and vigorously at the church-door. But half"
137,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"recovered from his wonder, he was just raising his voice to utter a"
138,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"remonstrance, when, to his sevenfold amazement, the door was opened to"
139,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"the knock, and the old man disappeared within."
140,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
141,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"It was not without a creeping feeling of awe, mingled with his"
142,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"astonishment, that Nathan gazed upon the door through which this"
143,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,silent figure had vanished. But he was not easily to be daunted. He
144,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,did not care to follow the steps of the stranger into the church; but
145,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"he remembered a shed so placed against the building, near the farther"
146,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"end, that he had often, when a child, at some peril indeed, climbed"
147,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"upon its top, and looked into the church through a little window at"
148,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,one side of the pulpit. For this he started; but he did not fail to
149,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,run across the square and leap over the church-gate at the top of his
150,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"speed, in order to gather warmth and courage for the attempt."
151,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
152,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,When Nathan Stoddard climbed upon the old shed and pressed his face
153,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"against the glass of the little church-window, he had at first only a"
154,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,confused impression of many lamps and many figures in all parts of the
155,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"church. But as his vision grew more clear, he beheld a sight which"
156,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,could not amaze him less than the apparition that startled Tam o'
157,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,Shanter as he glared through the darkness into the old Kirk of
158,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"Alloway. The great chandelier of the church was partly lighted, and"
159,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"there were, besides, many candles and lanterns burning in different"
160,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"parts of the room, and casting their light upon a large party of young"
161,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"men and women, who were dressed in breeches and ruffled shirts, and"
162,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"hooped petticoats and towering head-dresses, such as he had only seen"
163,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"in old pictures. They were mounted upon benches and ladders, and"
164,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"boards laid along the tops of the pews, and were apparently just"
165,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"completing the decoration of the church, which was already dressed"
166,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"with green, with little trees in the corners, and with green letters"
167,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"upon the walls, and great wreaths about the pillars. The whole party"
168,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"appeared full of life and cheerfulness, while the old man whom Nathan"
169,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"had seen enter stood near the door, looking quietly on, with a little"
170,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,girl holding his hand.
171,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
172,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,It was not until Nathan Stoddard had looked for some little time upon
173,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,this spectacle that he began to feel that he was witness of any thing
174,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"more than natural. The whole party had so home-like an air, and"
175,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"appeared so engaged with their pleasant occupation, that,"
176,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"notwithstanding their quaint dress, Nathan only thought how much he"
177,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,should like to share their company. But the more he studied their
178,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"faces, the more he was filled, for all their appearance of youth and"
179,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"their simple manners, with a strange sort of veneration. The sweet and"
180,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,cheerful faces of the young women seemed to grow awfully calm and
181,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"beautiful as they brought their task to a close, and their foreheads,"
182,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"with the hair brought back in the old-fashioned way, to become more"
183,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and more serene and high. There was a strange beauty, too, about the"
184,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,old man's face. He appeared to Nathan as if he felt that the group
185,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,before him only waited his command to fade away in the morning light
186,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"that struggled among the candles, but he could not bear to give the"
187,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"word; and so they kept playing with the festoons, and stepping about"
188,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"the pews to please him. Nathan felt a cold thrill, partly from"
189,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"pleasure, and partly from awe, running up his back, and a strong pain"
190,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"across his forehead, seldom known to one of his temperament. Again and"
191,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"again he drew his hand across his brows, until he felt that he was"
192,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"near swooning, and like to fall; and he clung desperately to his hold."
193,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"When the fit was over, he dared venture no more, but hastened to the"
194,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,ground.
195,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
196,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,It was no fear of ridicule or of incredulity that led Nathan Stoddard
197,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,to keep secret what he had witnessed. But it was like some deep and
198,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,holy experience that would lose its charm if it were spoken of to
199,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"another. So he went back to his shop, and sat looking upon the church,"
200,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and watching, almost with dread, the doves that lighted upon its roof,"
201,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and fluttered about, and beat their wings against its windows."
202,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
203,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,The minister of Nathan's parish was a young man by the name of Dudley;
204,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and it so happened that he had driven out, before light, on the"
205,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"morning we have spoken of, to visit a sick man at some distance.  In"
206,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"returning home, he had to pass along the rather unfrequented street"
207,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"which runs in the rear of his church, and close to it. As he was"
208,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"driving rapidly along, his ear caught what seemed the peal of an"
209,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"organ. He stopped his horse to listen, and a moment convinced him that"
210,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,the sound both of the instrument and of singing voices came from his
211,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,own church; and it was music of a depth and beauty such as he had
212,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"never before heard within it. Filled with astonishment, he put his"
213,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"horse upon its fastest trot, and drove round into the square, to the"
214,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,shop of Nathan Stoddard.
215,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
216,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"""There is music to-day in our church, Nathan!"" he cried to the young"
217,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"saddler. ""What can it mean?"" But Nathan answered not a word. He caught"
218,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"the horse by the head, and fastened him to a post before the"
219,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"door. Then stepping to the side of the sleigh, he said to Mr. Dudley,"
220,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"""Come with me, Sir."" Mr. Dudley looked upon the pale face and"
221,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"trembling lips of his parishioner, and followed in silence."
222,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
223,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"Nathan sprang upon the shed at the side of the church, and scrambled"
224,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"up to the little window. Mr. Dudley followed, and, with Nathan's help,"
225,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"gained the same precarious foothold. ""Look in, Sir,"" said Nathan, not"
226,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"venturing a glance himself. Mr. Dudley looked, and had not Nathan's"
227,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"arm been about his body he would have lost his hold, in sheer"
228,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"amazement. The building was crowded, as he had never known it before;"
229,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"and crowded with people whom his eye, versed in the dress and manners"
230,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"of our forefathers, recognized as the church-goers of a century and a"
231,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,half ago. The singers' gallery was filled by a choir of girls and
232,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"boys, while his own place in the pulpit was occupied by a white-haired"
233,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"figure, whom he recognized as the original of a portrait which he had"
234,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,purchased and hung in his parlor at home for its singular beauty. It
235,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"was said to be a portrait of a minister in the town, who lived in the"
236,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"last century, and is still remembered for his virtues. The sight of"
237,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,this old man's face completely stilled the agitation of the young
238,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"minister. He was leaning over the great Bible, with his hands folded"
239,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"upon it, and his eyes seemingly filled with tears of pleasure and"
240,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"gratitude, and bent upon the choir. Mr. Dudley listened intently, and"
241,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,could catch what seemed the words of some old Christmas carol:
242,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
243,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"""Thou mak'st my cup of joy run o'er."""
244,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
245,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"And he was so rapt with the sights and the sounds within, that it"
246,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,needed all Nathan's endeavors to uphold him.
247,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
248,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"By this time the sound of a gathering crowd below, which he had not"
249,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"heeded at first, was forced more and more upon his notice; and the"
250,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"anxious voice of his oldest deacon calling, ""Mr. Dudley! Mr. Dudley!"""
251,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,rose high and loud; while a great thundering at the front door of the
252,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,church announced that the people below had also caught the sound of
253,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"the music, and were clamorous for admission. Mr. Dudley hastened round"
254,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,to prevent their causing any disturbance to the congregation within;
255,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"but he came only in time to see the door burst open, and to be borne"
256,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"in with the crowd. All gazed about in wonder. The congregation,"
257,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"indeed, were gone, and the preacher, and the choir; and the room was"
258,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"cold. But there was a great green cross over the pulpit, and words"
259,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"along the walls, and festoons upon the galleries, and great wreaths,"
260,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"like vast green serpents, coiled about the cold pillars. The church of"
261,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,the Orthodox parish of ---- had been fairly dressed for Christmas by
262,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,spirit hands.
263,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
264,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"When Mr. Dudley reached his home, after the wonder had in part spent"
265,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"itself, he found that an enormous Christmas pie had been left at his"
266,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"door by a white-haired old man dressed in black, about six in the"
267,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"morning, just after he had gone to visit his sick parishioner. The"
268,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"girl who received it reported the old man as saying, in a tremulous,"
269,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"but very kind voice, ""Give your master the Christmas blessing of an"
270,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"old Puritan minister."" How the meaning of this message would have been"
271,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"known to Mr. Dudley, had not the events we have told disclosed it, who"
272,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,can say?
273,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,
274,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"Need I add, that my friend, Mr. Dudley, from whose lips I have taken"
275,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"down the above narrative, has directed the decorations to remain in"
276,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"his church during the coming month, and that he avows the intention of"
277,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"observing the Christmas of the following year with public services,"
278,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"unless, indeed, he should be anticipated by his ancient"
279,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"predecessor. It may not be impertinent to observe, that I am invited"
280,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,"to dine and spend the day with the Dudleys on that occasion, and I"
281,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,shall not fail to make an accurate report of whatever glimpse I may
282,CHRISTMAS REVIVED.,obtain into the mysterious ceremonies of a Puritan Christmas.

326,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,
327,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,
328,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"The little south-wind had been shut up for many days, while his cousin"
329,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"from the northeast had been abroad, and the clouds had been heavy and"
330,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"dark; but now all was bright and clear, and the little south-wind was"
331,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"to have a holiday. O, how happy he would be! He sallied forth to amuse"
332,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"himself;--and hear what he did. He came whistling down the chimney,"
333,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,until the nervous old lady was ready to fly with vexation: then away
334,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"he flew, laughing in triumph,--the naughty south-wind! He played with"
335,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"the maiden's work: away the pieces flew, some here, some there, and"
336,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,away ran the maiden after. What cared _she_ for the wind? She tossed
337,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"back her curls and laughed merrily, and the wind laughed merrily"
338,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"too,--the silly south-wind! Onward he stole, and lifting the"
339,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"curtain,--curious south-wind!--what did he see? On the sofa lay a"
340,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,young man: a heavy book was in his hand. The little south-wind rustled
341,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"through the leaves, but the young man stirred not; he was asleep; hot"
342,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"and weary, he slept. The wind fanned his brow awhile, lifted his dark"
343,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"locks, and, leaving a kiss behind, stole out at the casement,--the"
344,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,gentle south-wind! Then he met a little child: away he whirled the
345,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"little boy's hat, away ran the child, but his little feet were tired,"
346,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"and he wept,--poor child! The wind looked back, and felt sad, then"
347,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"hung the hat on a bush, and went on. He had played too hard,--the"
348,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,thoughtless south-wind! A sick child lay tossing to and fro: its hands
349,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,and face were hot and dry. The mother raised the window. The wind
350,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"heard her as he was creeping by, and stepping in, he cooled the"
351,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"burning face: then, playing among the flowers until their fragrance"
352,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"filled the room, away he flew,--the kind south-wind! He went out into"
353,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"the highway, and played with the dust; but that was not so pleasant,"
354,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,and onward he sped to the meadow. The dust could not follow on the
355,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"green grass, and the little south-wind soon outstripped it, and onward"
356,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"and onward he sped, over mountain and valley, dancing among the"
357,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"flowers, and frolicking round, until the trees lifted up their arms"
358,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"and bent their heads and shook their sides with glee,--the happy"
359,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"south-wind! At last he came to a quiet dell, where a little brook lay,"
360,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"just stirring among his white pebbles. The wind said, ""Kind brook,"
361,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"will you play with me?"" And the brook answered with a sparkling smile,"
362,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"and a gentle murmur. Then the wind rose up, and, sporting among the"
363,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"dark pines, whistled and sung through the lofty branches, while the"
364,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"pretty brook danced along, and warbled songs to the music of its merry"
365,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"companion,--the merry south-wind! But the sun had gone down and the"
366,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"stars were peeping forth, and the day was done. The happy south-wind"
367,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"was still, and the moon looked down on the world below, and watched"
368,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"among the trees and hills, but all was still: the little south-wind"
369,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"slumbered, and the moon and the stars kept guard,--poor, tired"
370,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"south-wind! Old lady and maiden, young man and child, the dust and the"
371,THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.,"flowers, were forgotten, and he slept,--dear little south-wind!"

520,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.
521,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
522,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
523,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"In looking back upon my early days, one of the images that rises most"
524,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"vividly to my mind's eye is that of Miss Molly ----, or Aunt Molly, as"
525,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"she was called by some of her little favorites, that is to say, about"
526,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"a dozen girls, and (not complimentary to the _un_fair sex, to be sure)"
527,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"one boy. There was one, who, even to Miss Molly, was not a torment and"
528,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,a plague; and I must confess he was a pleasant specimen of the
529,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"genus. At the time of which I speak, the great awkward barn of a"
530,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"school-house on the Common, near the Appian Way, had not reared its"
531,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"imposing front. In its place, in the centre of a grass-plot that was"
532,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"one of the very first to look green in spring, and kept its verdure"
533,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"through the heats of July, stood the brown, one-storied cottage which"
534,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"she owned, and in which the aged woman lived, alone. Her garden and"
535,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"clothes-yard behind the house were fenced in; but in front, the"
536,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"visitor to the cottage, unimpeded by gate or fence, turned up the"
537,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,pretty green slope directly from the street to the lowly door.
538,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
539,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"As I have started for a walk into the old times, and am not bound by"
540,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"any rule to stick to the point, I will here digress to say that the"
541,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"Episcopal Church (_the Church_, as it was simply called, when all the"
542,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"rest were ""meeting-houses""), that tells the traveller what a pure and"
543,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"true taste was once present in Cambridge, and, by the contrast it"
544,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"presents to the architectural blunders that abound in the place, tells"
545,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"also what a want of it there is now,--this beautiful church stood most"
546,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"appropriately and tastefully surrounded by the green turf, unbroken by"
547,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"stiff gravel walks or coach sweep, and undivided from the public walk"
548,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"by a fence. Behind the church, and forming a part of its own grounds,"
549,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"(where now exist the elegances of School Court,) was an unappropriated"
550,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"field; and that spot was considered, by a certain little group of"
551,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"children, of six or seven years old, the most solitary, gloomy,"
552,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,mysterious place in their little world. When the colors of sunset had
553,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"died out in the west, and the stillness and shadow of twilight were"
554,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"coming on, they used to ""snatch a fearful joy"" in seeing one of their"
555,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,number (whose mother had kindly omitted the first lesson usually
556,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"taught to little girls, to be afraid of every thing) perform the feat"
557,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"of going slowly around the church, alone, stopping behind it to count"
558,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,a hundred. Her wonderful courage in actually protecting the whole
559,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"group from what they called a ""flock of cows,"" and in staking and"
560,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"patting the ""mad dogs"" that they were for ever meeting, was nothing to"
561,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,this _going round the church!_
562,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
563,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"But to return to the cottage, from which the pretty, rural trait of"
564,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,its standing in its unfenced green door-yard led me away to notice the
565,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,same sort of rustic beauty where the church stood. We did not stop to
566,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"knock at the outside door,--for Aunt Molly was very deaf, and if we"
567,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"had knocked our little knuckles off she would not have heard us,--but"
568,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"went in, and, passing along the passage, rapped at the door of the"
569,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"""common room,"" half sitting-room, half kitchen, and were"
570,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"admitted. Those who saw her for the first time, whether children or"
571,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"grown people, were generally afraid of her; for her voice,"
572,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"unmodulated, of course, by the ear, was naturally harsh, strong, and"
573,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"high-toned; and the sort of half laugh, half growl, that she uttered"
574,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"when pleased, might have suggested to an imaginative child the howl of"
575,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"a wolf. She had very large features, and sharp, penetrating black"
576,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"eyes, shaded by long, gray lashes, and surmounted by thick, bushy,"
577,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"gray eyebrows. I think that when she was scolding the school-boys,"
578,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"with those eyes fiercely ""glowering"" at them from under the shaggy"
579,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"gray thatch, she must have appeared to those who in their learned page"
580,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"had got as far as the Furies, like a living illustration of classic"
581,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"lore. Her cap and the make of her dress were peculiar, and suggestive"
582,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"of those days before, and at the time of, the Revolution, of which she"
583,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,loved to speak.
584,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
585,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"But we, her little favorites, were not afraid of her. To go into her"
586,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"garden in summer, and eat currants, larger and sweeter than any we"
587,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"found at home,--to look up at the enormous old damson-tree, when it"
588,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"was white with blossoms, and the rich honey-comb smell was diffused"
589,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"over the whole garden,--was a pleasant little excursion to us. She"
590,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"took great care and pains to save the plums from the plundering boys,"
591,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,because it was the only real damson there was anywhere in the
592,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"neighborhood, and she found a ready sale for them, for preserves. She"
593,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,seemed to think that the _real damsons_ went out with the _real
594,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"gentry_ of the olden time; and perhaps they did, _as_ damsons, though,"
595,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"for aught I know, they may figure now in our fruit catalogues as ""The"
596,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"Duke of Argyle's New Seedling Acidulated Drop of Damascus,""--which"
597,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,would be something like a translation of Damson into the modern
598,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,terminology.
599,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
600,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"But more pleasant still was it to go into Aunt Molly's ""best room."""
601,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"The walls she had papered herself, with curious stripes and odd"
602,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"pieces, of various shapes and patterns, ornamented with a border of"
603,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"figures of little men and women joining hands, cut from paper of all"
604,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"colors; and they were adorned, besides, with several prints in shining"
605,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"black frames. There was no carpet on the snow-white, unpainted floor,"
606,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"but various mats and rugs, of all the kinds into which ingenuity has"
607,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"transformed woollen rags, were disposed about it. The bed was the"
608,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"pride and glory of the room, however; for on it was spread a silk"
609,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"patchwork quilt, made of pieces of the brocade and damask and elegant"
610,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"silks, of which the ladies belonging to the grand old Tory families"
611,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"had their gowns and cardinals, and other paraphernalia, made. Aunt"
612,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"Molly had been a mantuamaker to the old ""quality,"" and she could show"
613,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,us a piece of Madam Vassall's gown on that wonderful and brilliant
614,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"piece of work, the bed-quilt. ""On that hint"" she would speak."
615,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
616,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"""A-haw-awr! They were _real gentle_ folks that lived in _them_ days."
617,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"A-haw-awr! I declare, I could e'en-amost kneel down and kiss the very"
618,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"airth they trod on, as they went by my house to church. Polite, _they"
619,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"wor!_ Yes, they knew what true politeness was; and to my thinking true"
620,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"politeness is next to saving grace."""
621,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,
622,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"Once a year, or so, Aunt Molly would dress up in her best gown, a"
623,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"black silk, trimmed with real black lace, and a real lace cap, relics"
624,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"of the good old days of Toryism and brocade and the real gentry, and"
625,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,go to make an afternoon visit to one of her neighbors. After the usual
626,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"salutations, the lady would ask her visitor to take off her bonnet and"
627,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"stay the afternoon, knowing by the ""rig"" that such was her intention."
628,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"But she liked to be urged a little, so she would say, ""O, I only came"
629,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"out for a little walk, it was so pleasant, and stopped in to see how"
630,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"little Henry did, since his sickness.  You know I always call him _my"
631,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"boy_."" (Yes, Aunt Molly, the only boy in the universe that, for you,"
632,A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.,"had any good in him.) After the proper amount of urging, she would lay"

942,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"themselves near-sighted!"" Or, ""Pooh! It's all affectation. She can see"
943,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"as well as any body, if she chooses. She thinks it is pretty to half"
944,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"shut her eyes, and cut her acquaintances."" I meet my friend A----,"

949,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"seeing your old schoolmate, two seats behind her,--of course you are"
950,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"too near-sighted!"" In vain I protest that I could not see her,--that"
951,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,three yards is a great distance to my eyes.  She leaves me with an
952,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"incredulous smile, and that most provoking phrase, ""O yes! I _suppose_"

969,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,and he can hardly believe that this brilliant point is not an optical

971,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"so to her, and he turns to look in her face, he says, ""Why, mother!"
972,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"how beautiful you look!  Please to give me some little spectacles,"
973,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"_all my own!_"" She could not resist this entreaty,--(who could?)--and"

978,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"I was summoned, the other day, to welcome a family of cousins from a"
979,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"distant State, whom I had not seen for a very long time. They were"
980,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"accompanied, I was told, by a Boston lady, a stranger to us. I entered"
981,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"the room with considerable _empressement_, but when my eye detected"
982,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"the dim outline of a circle of bonneted figures, I stopped in despair"
983,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"in the middle of the room, not knowing which was which, or whom I"
984,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"ought to speak to first, and at last made an embarrassed half-bow,"
985,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"half-courtesy, to the company in general. A confused murmur of"
986,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"greetings and introductions followed, and, throwing aside my air of"
987,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"stiff, ceremonious politeness, I rushed, with a smiling face, to the"
988,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"nearest lady, shook hands with her in the most cordial manner, and"
989,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"then, in passing, bowed formally to the next, who I concluded was the"
990,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,stranger. What then was my surprise and utter confusion when she
991,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"caught me by the hand, and, drawing me towards her, kissed me"
992,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"emphatically several times. ""How _do_ you do, dear? Have you quite"

994,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"cock-horse, on my knee, to Banbury Cross, to see the old lady get on"
995,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"her white horse!"" What could I say? I was petrified. I could not"
996,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"smile, I could not speak. My only feeling was mortification at my most"
997,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,awkward mistake. Yet I ought to have become accustomed to such
998,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"embarrassments, for they are of very frequent occurrence."

1000,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"""Why, Julia! what is the matter? How strangely your eyes look!""  My"
1001,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"sister at this exclamation turns round, and I discover that from the"

1008,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"cow for a human being, as was done by old Dr. E----. It was many years"
1009,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"ago, when Boston Common was still used as a pasture, and cows were"
1010,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"daily to be met in the crooked streets of the city, that this"
1011,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"gentleman, distinguished for the courtesy and old-school politeness of"
1012,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"his manner, no less than for his extreme near-sightedness, was walking"
1013,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"at a brisk pace, one winter's day, and saw, just before him, a lady,"
1014,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"as he thought, richly dressed in furs.  As he was passing her, he"
1015,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,thought he perceived that her fur boa or tippet had escaped from her
1016,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"neck, and, carefully lifting the end of it with one hand, he made a"
1017,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"low bow, raising his hat with the other, and said in his blandest"
1018,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"tone, ""Madam, you are losing your tippet!"" And what thanks did the"
1019,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"worthy Doctor receive, do you think, for this truly kind and polite"
1020,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"deed? Why, the lady merely turned her head, gave him a wondering stare"
1021,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"with her large eyes, and said, ""Moo-o-o-o!"""
1022,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,
1023,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,As an offset to this instance of courtesy and good-breeding lavished
1024,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"on a cow, let me give you, as a parting _bon-bouche_, another cow"

1028,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"The Rev. Dr. H---- was an eccentric old man, near-sighted of"
1029,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"course,--all eccentric people are,--who lived in a small country town"
1030,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,in this neighborhood. Numerous are the traditionary accounts of his
1031,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"peculiarities,--of his odd manners and customs,--which I have heard;"
1032,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,but it is only of one little incident that I am now going to speak. A
1033,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"favorite employment of this good man was the care of his garden, and"
1034,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"he might be seen any pleasant afternoon in summer, rigged out in a"
1035,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"hideous yellow calico robe, or blouse, with a dusty old black straw"
1036,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"hat stuck on the back of his head, hoeing and digging in that beloved"
1037,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"patch of ground. One day as he was thus occupied, his wife emerged"
1038,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"from the house, dressed in a dark brown gingham, and bearing in her"
1039,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"hand some ""muslins,"" which she began to spread upon the"
1040,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"gooseberry-bushes to whiten. She was very busily engaged, so that she"
1041,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"was not aware that her husband was approaching her with a large stick,"
1042,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"until she felt a smart blow across her shoulders, and heard his"
1043,TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.,"peculiar, sharp voice shouting in her ears, ""Go 'long! old cow! Go"

1134,MISERIES.,Did you ever try to eat a peach elegantly and gracefully? Of course

1136,MISERIES.,"the restraint of human surveillance, and I shall look upon him as a"
1137,MISERIES.,"curiosity. There is no fruit, certainly, which has so fair and"
1138,MISERIES.,alluring an exterior; but few content themselves with feasting their
1139,MISERIES.,"eyes upon it. How fresh and ripe it looks as it lies upon the plate,"
1140,MISERIES.,with its rosy cheek turned temptingly upward! How cool and soft is the
1141,MISERIES.,"downy skin to the touch! And the fragrance, so suggestive of its rich,"
1142,MISERIES.,"delicious flavor, who can resist? Ah, unhappy wight! Bitterly you"
1143,MISERIES.,shall repent your rashness. Any other fruit can be eaten with
1144,MISERIES.,comparative ease and politeness; a peach was evidently intended only
1145,MISERIES.,"to be looked at, or enjoyed beneath your own tree, where no eye may"
1146,MISERIES.,watch and criticize your motions.
1147,MISERIES.,
1148,MISERIES.,"I see you, in imagination, at a party, standing in the middle of the"
1149,MISERIES.,"room, plate in hand, regarding your peach as if it were some great"
1150,MISERIES.,natural curiosity. A sudden jog of your elbow compels you to a
1151,MISERIES.,succession of most dexterous balancings as your heavy peach rolls from
1152,MISERIES.,"side to side, knocks down your knife, and threatens to plunge after it"
1153,MISERIES.,"when you stoop to regain it. You look distractedly round for a table,"
1154,MISERIES.,but all are occupied. Even the corner of the mantel-shelf holds a
1155,MISERIES.,"plate, and you enviously see the owner thereof leaning carelessly"
1156,MISERIES.,"against the chimney, and looking placidly round upon his less"
1157,MISERIES.,fortunate companions. You glance at the different groups to see if any
1158,MISERIES.,"one else is in your most unenviable predicament. Ah, yes! Yonder"
1159,MISERIES.,"stands a gentleman worse off yet, for, in addition to your"
1160,MISERIES.,"perplexities, he is talking with a young, laughing girl, who is"
1161,MISERIES.,"watching his movements, with a merry twinkle in her bright eyes. He"
1162,MISERIES.,"evidently wishes to astonish her by his dexterity, and disappoint her"
1163,MISERIES.,"roguish expectations. He holds his plate firmly in his left hand, and"
1164,MISERIES.,"proceeds, at once, to cut his peach in halves. Deuce take the blunt"
1165,MISERIES.,silver knife! The tough skin resists its pressure. The knife and plate
1166,MISERIES.,clash loudly together; the peach is bounding and rolling at the very
1167,MISERIES.,"feet of the young lady, who is in an ecstasy of laughter. Ah! she"
1168,MISERIES.,"herself has no small resemblance to a peach, fair, beautiful, and"
1169,MISERIES.,"attractive without, and, I sadly fear, with a hard heart beneath."
1170,MISERIES.,
1171,MISERIES.,Are you yet more miserable than before? Turn then to yonder
1172,MISERIES.,"sober-looking gentleman, who certainly seems sufficiently composed to"

1174,MISERIES.,"sure; but that is not every thing. He begins right, by deliberately"
1175,MISERIES.,"removing the woolly skin. Now he lays the slippery peach in his plate,"
1176,MISERIES.,"and makes a plunge at it with his knife. A sharp, prolonged screech"
1177,MISERIES.,"across his plate salutes the ears of all the bystanders, and a fine"
1178,MISERIES.,slice of juicy pulp is flung unceremoniously into the face of the
1179,MISERIES.,"gentleman opposite, who certainly does not look very grateful for the"
1180,MISERIES.,unexpected gift.

1182,MISERIES.,"Every one, of course, has seen the awkward accident. O no! That"

1185,MISERIES.,"her fan, and casting many sparkling glances upward at the two"
1186,MISERIES.,"gentlemen who are vying with each other in their gallant attentions,"
1187,MISERIES.,she has enough to do without noticing other people. She is happily
1188,MISERIES.,"unconscious of the mortification which is in store for her, or"
1189,MISERIES.,"wilfully shuts her eyes to the peril. Alas! Her hand is resting, even"
1190,MISERIES.,"now, upon the destroyer of all her present enjoyment, the beautiful,"
1191,MISERIES.,"fragrant, treacherous peach. With a nonchalance really shocking to the"
1192,MISERIES.,"anxious beholder, she raises it, and breaks it open, talking the"
1193,MISERIES.,"while, and scarcely bestowing a thought upon what she is about."
1194,MISERIES.,"Dexterously done; but--O luckless maiden!--the fruit is ripe, and"
1195,MISERIES.,"rich, and juicy, and the running drops fall, not into her plate, but"
1196,MISERIES.,upon the delicate folds of her dress.
1197,MISERIES.,
1198,MISERIES.,"The merry repartee dies away upon her lips, as she becomes conscious"

1201,MISERIES.,"How many blunders, how many pauses, how many absent-minded remarks it"

1203,MISERIES.,"gayety, but in vain. Her gloves are stained and sticky with the"
1204,MISERIES.,"flowing juice, and she is oppressed by the conviction that all her"
1205,MISERIES.,partners for the rest of the evening will hate her most heartily. An
1206,MISERIES.,"expression of real vexation steals over her pretty face, and she gives"
1207,MISERIES.,"up her plate to one of the attendant beaux, with not so much as a wish"
1208,MISERIES.,"that he will return to her. Where are the arch smiles, the lively"

1212,MISERIES.,
1213,MISERIES.,Ah! I see your courage will not brave laughter. You steal to the

1215,MISERIES.,Your sudden zeal to relieve those ladies of their plates serves as a

1243,A DARK NIGHT.,bewilderment and helplessness and timidity comes over me. I have not
1244,A DARK NIGHT.,the least idea in what part of the room I am. I am oppressed with a
1245,A DARK NIGHT.,"sense of chairs, scattered about in improbable places. I long most"
1246,A DARK NIGHT.,"ardently for a lamp, or only for one gleam from a neighbor's"
1247,A DARK NIGHT.,"window. It is no rare thing for me to discover, by a thrilling touch"
1248,A DARK NIGHT.,"upon the cold glass, that I have been feeling my way exactly in the"
1249,A DARK NIGHT.,opposite direction from what I imagined.  Strange how ideas of
1250,A DARK NIGHT.,direction and distance are lost when the sight is powerless! _Touch_
1251,A DARK NIGHT.,"may find out mistakes, but cannot always prevent them. Touch may"
1252,A DARK NIGHT.,"convince me that I have arrived at my bureau, but it is too careless"
1253,A DARK NIGHT.,"to perceive (what the poor, straining eyes would have discovered at a"
1254,A DARK NIGHT.,glance) the open upper drawer that salutes my forehead as I stoop
1255,A DARK NIGHT.,hastily to grasp the handles beneath. Touch is clumsy. It only serves
1256,A DARK NIGHT.,"to upset valuable plants, inkstands, solar lamps, &c., with an"
1257,A DARK NIGHT.,"appalling crash, and then leaves me standing aghast, in utter"
1258,A DARK NIGHT.,uncertainty as to the extent of the catastrophe. In such emergencies a
1259,A DARK NIGHT.,rush for the stairs is the first impulse. Ah! but those stairs!
1260,A DARK NIGHT.,
1261,A DARK NIGHT.,"I will pass over the startling plunge which begins my descent, the"
1262,A DARK NIGHT.,"frantic snatch for the banisters, and the strange, momentary doubt as"
1263,A DARK NIGHT.,"to which foot must move first, like what a child may feel when"
1264,A DARK NIGHT.,"learning to walk. All this only serves to render me so over-careful,"
1265,A DARK NIGHT.,"that, when I actually arrive at the foot of the staircase, I cannot"
1266,A DARK NIGHT.,"believe it, until a loud scuff, and the shock that follows the"
1267,A DARK NIGHT.,"interruption of my expected descent, assure me beyond a doubt. There"
1268,A DARK NIGHT.,"is nothing more exasperating than this, unless it may be the"
1269,A DARK NIGHT.,"corresponding disappointment in running up stairs, when you raise your"
1270,A DARK NIGHT.,"foot high in air, and bring it down with an emphatic stamp exactly"
1271,A DARK NIGHT.,upon a level with the other.
1272,A DARK NIGHT.,
1273,A DARK NIGHT.,"But these are mere household experiences. Sad though they are, I"
1274,A DARK NIGHT.,esteem them as nothing in comparison with my adventures out of doors.
1275,A DARK NIGHT.,"In a dark night, and especially in a night both dark and stormy, I"
1276,A DARK NIGHT.,feel myself one of the most wretched beings in existence. Imagine a
1277,A DARK NIGHT.,"vessel lost in the wide ocean, and without a compass, and you will"
1278,A DARK NIGHT.,"have some faint idea of my perplexity, discouragement, and loneliness"
1279,A DARK NIGHT.,at such a time. I have a strange propensity for shooting off into the
1280,A DARK NIGHT.,"gutter, or for shouldering the fences, under the impression that I am"
1281,A DARK NIGHT.,pursuing a straight course. I go quite out of my way to trip over
1282,A DARK NIGHT.,"chance stones, or to pick out choice bits of slippery ice. I splash"
1283,A DARK NIGHT.,"recklessly through deep puddles, stumble over unfortunate scrapers,"
1284,A DARK NIGHT.,"walk unexpectedly into open cellars, and lay my length upon wet stone"
1285,A DARK NIGHT.,doorsteps. I start back at visions of posts looming up in the
1286,A DARK NIGHT.,"darkness, and whitewashed fences and trees, all of which would be"
1287,A DARK NIGHT.,"quite unlikely to be standing in the middle of the sidewalk, and which"
1288,A DARK NIGHT.,disappear at the first reasonable thought. I run into harmless
1289,A DARK NIGHT.,"passengers as if I would knock the breath of life out of them, and"
1290,A DARK NIGHT.,tangle our umbrellas together so fearfully that they spin round and
1291,A DARK NIGHT.,round some time after their separation. O that umbrella of mine!
1292,A DARK NIGHT.,"Sometimes I hook it in the drooping branches of trees, and, losing my"
1293,A DARK NIGHT.,"hold in the suddenness of the shock, have the gratification of feeling"
1294,A DARK NIGHT.,"it tip up, and go down over my shoulder into the mud behind me. Its"
1295,A DARK NIGHT.,"bone tips tap and scratch at the windows as I go by, and scrape"
1296,A DARK NIGHT.,"against the tall fences, like fingers trying to catch at something to"
1297,A DARK NIGHT.,"hold on by, and stop my progress. It hits a low branch, and its"
1298,A DARK NIGHT.,"varnished handle slips through my woollen gloves, knocking my hat over"
1299,A DARK NIGHT.,"my eyes, and extinguishing me for the time being. As if the night were"
1300,A DARK NIGHT.,not dark enough without!
1301,A DARK NIGHT.,
1302,A DARK NIGHT.,"My friends, I could go on much longer with my complaints, but I feel"
1303,A DARK NIGHT.,that I have drawn upon your sympathies sufficiently for the

1305,A DARK NIGHT.,to find it.

1317,TWINE.,"Under the general head of _string_, I might enumerate a long list of"
1318,TWINE.,this world's miseries. Shoe-strings alone comprehend an amount of
1319,TWINE.,"wretchedness, which is but feebly described in the tragical story of"
1320,TWINE.,"Jemmy String. Bonnet-strings and apron-strings, dickey-strings and"
1321,TWINE.,"watch-guards, curtain-cord, bed-cord, and cod-line, each and all have"
1322,TWINE.,furnished enough discomfort to make out a long grumbling article. But
1323,TWINE.,I cannot linger to describe their treacherous desertions when their
1324,TWINE.,"services are most needed, their unexpected weakness, and their"
1325,TWINE.,obstinate entanglements when time presses. A certain pudding-bag
1326,TWINE.,string is commemorated in one of the beautiful couplets of Mother
1327,TWINE.,"Goose's Melodies. I am sure you cannot have forgotten it, nor the"
1328,TWINE.,staring spotted cat that is there represented racing away with her
1329,TWINE.,booty. That lamented pudding-bag string is but a type of strings in
1330,TWINE.,"general. They are fleeting possessions, always hiding, always"
1331,TWINE.,"misplaced, never in order. You fit up a string-drawer, perhaps, with a"
1332,TWINE.,"fine assortment, and pride yourself upon its nice arrangement. Go to"
1333,TWINE.,"it a week after, and see if you can find one ball where you left it!"
1334,TWINE.,"Can you lay your hand upon a single piece that you want? No, indeed!"
1335,TWINE.,"Twine is considered common property. If any one has a use for it, he"
1336,TWINE.,"takes it without leave or license, without even inquiring who is the"
1337,TWINE.,"owner, and you may be sure he will never bring any of it back again. O"
1338,TWINE.,"the misery endured for the want of an errant piece of twine, when you"
1339,TWINE.,"are in a nervous hurry to do up a parcel, some one waiting at the door"
1340,TWINE.,"meanwhile! After an immense deal of pains, you have it at last folded"
1341,TWINE.,"to your liking, with every corner squared and even, every wrinkle"
1342,TWINE.,"smoothed. Then, clasping tightly with one hand the stiff wrapper, you"
1343,TWINE.,"search distractedly with the other for a ball of twine, which you"
1344,TWINE.,distinctly remember tossing into the paper-drawer only the day before.
1345,TWINE.,"In vain you surround yourself with newspaper and brown paper, and"
1346,TWINE.,"useless rubbish, tumbling your whole drawer into confusion. In vain"
1347,TWINE.,"you relinquish your nicely packed parcel, and see its contents"
1348,TWINE.,scattered in all directions. In vain you grumble and scold. The ball
1349,TWINE.,"is not forthcoming. Your little brother has seized it to fly his kite,"
1350,TWINE.,"or your sister is even now tying up her trailing morning-glories, or"
1351,TWINE.,"sweet peas, with the stolen booty. You plunge your hand exploringly"
1352,TWINE.,"into the drawer, and bring up a long roll wound thickly with twine of"
1353,TWINE.,"all kinds and colors. Your eyes sparkle at the prize; but, alas! the"
1354,TWINE.,first energetic pull leaves in your hand a piece about four inches
1355,TWINE.,"long, and a quantity of dangling ends and rough knots convince you"
1356,TWINE.,that you have nothing to hope in that quarter. A second plunge brings
1357,TWINE.,"up a handful of odds and ends, strong pieces clumsy and rough, coarse"
1358,TWINE.,"red quill-cord, delicate two-colored bits far too short, cotton twine"
1359,TWINE.,"breaking at a touch, fine long pieces hopelessly tangled together, so"
1360,TWINE.,"that not even an end is visible. The more you twitch at the loops, the"
1361,TWINE.,more desperate is the snarl. Poor mortal! Your pride gives way before
1362,TWINE.,the urgency of haste.  You send off your nice packet miserably tied
1363,TWINE.,together by two kinds of twine.
1364,TWINE.,
1365,TWINE.,All the rest of the day you are tormented by a superfluity of the very
1366,TWINE.,thing you needed so much. It was impossible to get it when you wanted
1367,TWINE.,it; but now it is pertinaciously in your way when you do _not_ want
1368,TWINE.,"it. You almost break your neck tripping over a long, firm cord, which"
1369,TWINE.,proves to be a pair of reins left hanging on a chair by some careless
1370,TWINE.,"urchin. The carpet and furniture are strewed with long, straggling"
1371,TWINE.,pieces of packthread. You find a white end dangling conspicuously from
1372,TWINE.,your waistcoat pocket. As you walk the streets you see twine flying
1373,TWINE.,"from fences, or lying useless on the sidewalk, black with dust and"
1374,TWINE.,"age. To crown the whole, a friend comes with a piece of twine"
1375,TWINE.,"extending across two rooms, and asks you to help him twist and double"
1376,TWINE.,it into a cord. It is a very entertaining process. You amuse yourself
1377,TWINE.,"with watching one little rough place that whirls swiftly round, stops"
1378,TWINE.,"with a jerk, turns hesitatingly one side and the other, then, yielding"
1379,TWINE.,"to a new impulse, flies round and round again till you are dizzy. You"
1380,TWINE.,"look with great complacency at the tightening twist, now brought"
1381,TWINE.,"_almost_ to perfection. You turn it carelessly in your fingers,"
1382,TWINE.,scarcely noticing its convulsive starts for freedom. Ah! your
1383,TWINE.,"imprudent friend, without any warning, gives it a final pull to"
1384,TWINE.,"stretch it into shape. The twine slips from your grasp, springs away"
1385,TWINE.,"across the room, curls itself into a succession of snarls and twisted"
1386,TWINE.,"loops, and then lies motionless. Your friend looks thunderstruck. With"
1387,TWINE.,"a hasty apology, you step forward and tightly clasp the recreant"
1388,TWINE.,end. You are in nervous expectation of dropping it again. Your fingers
1389,TWINE.,"are benumbed at the tips with their tight compression, and the"
1390,TWINE.,constant twitching. They give a sudden jerk. You make an involuntary
1391,TWINE.,"clutch for the cord, but in vain. It is rapidly untwisting at the very"
1392,TWINE.,"feet of your companion, who looks at it in despair. Again you make an"
1393,TWINE.,"attempt with no success at all, the refractory twine eluding your"
1394,TWINE.,utmost endeavors to hold it. Once more!  Your fellow-twister walks off
1395,TWINE.,"at last, with a wretchedly rough affair, which he good humoredly says"
1396,TWINE.,"""will do very well."""

1405,MISERIES.,
1406,MISERIES.,I believe the world has gone quite crazy on the subject of fresh
1407,MISERIES.,air. In the next century people will think they must sleep on the
1408,MISERIES.,"house-tops, I suppose, or camp out in tents in primitive style."
1409,MISERIES.,"Nothing is talked about but ventilators, and air-tubes, and"
1410,MISERIES.,chimney-draughts. One would suppose that fire-places were invented
1411,MISERIES.,"expressly for cooling and airing a room, instead of heating it. There"
1412,MISERIES.,was no such fuss when I was young; in those good old times these airy
1413,MISERIES.,notions had not come into fashion. Where the loose window-sashes
1414,MISERIES.,"rattled at every passing breeze, and the wind chased the smoke down"
1415,MISERIES.,"the wide-mouthed chimney, nobody complained of being stifled. There"
1416,MISERIES.,were no furnaces then to spread a summer heat to every corner of the
1417,MISERIES.,"house. No, indeed! We ran shivering through the long, windy entries,"
1418,MISERIES.,"all wrapped in shawls, and hugging ourselves to retain the friendly"
1419,MISERIES.,warmth of the fire as long as possible. Far from devising ways of
1420,MISERIES.,"letting _in_ the air, we tried hard to keep it _out_ by stuffing the"
1421,MISERIES.,"cracks with cotton, and closely curtaining the windows and bed. Even"
1422,MISERIES.,"then, the ice in the wash-basin, and the electricity which made our"
1423,MISERIES.,"hair literally stand on end in the process of combing, and the gradual"
1424,MISERIES.,"transformation of fingers into thumbs, showed but too plainly that the"
1425,MISERIES.,wintry air had penetrated our defences. When we crowded joyfully round
1426,MISERIES.,"a crackling, sparkling wood-fire, even while our faces glowed with the"
1427,MISERIES.,"intense heat, cold shivers were creeping down our backs, and sudden"
1428,MISERIES.,draughts from an opening door set our teeth chattering. I often wished
1429,MISERIES.,"myself on a spit, to revolve slowly before the fire until thoroughly"
1430,MISERIES.,"roasted. Not from any want of air, I assure you, we children were"
1431,MISERIES.,"always breaking panes of glass on the bitterest days, and the glazier"
1432,MISERIES.,was never known to come under a week to replace them. Why people
1433,MISERIES.,"should wish to revive, and live through again, the miseries of such a"
1434,MISERIES.,"frost-nipped childhood, I cannot imagine."
1435,MISERIES.,
1436,MISERIES.,"I, for one, love a snug house, even a warm house. I am of a chilly"
1437,MISERIES.,"temperament, and subject to rheumatism, horrible colds, &c. Fresh air"
1438,MISERIES.,is my bane. I banish all books on the subject from my table. I
1439,MISERIES.,"studiously avoid all notorious fresh-air lovers, or try in every way"
1440,MISERIES.,"to bring over the poor, misguided mortals to my views; but it is of no"
1441,MISERIES.,"use. Fresh air is the fashion, and is run to extremes, as all fashions"
1442,MISERIES.,must be. I call in a physician; lo! _fresh air_ is recommended as a
1443,MISERIES.,"tonic. I give a party; of course my windows are all thrown open, and"
1444,MISERIES.,"foolish young girls, in the thinnest of white muslins, are standing in"
1445,MISERIES.,"the draught; and such a whirlwind is raised by the flirting of fans,"
1446,MISERIES.,"and the rush of the dancers, that I am blown, like a dry leaf, into a"
1447,MISERIES.,"corner, where I stand shivering, and making rueful attempts to appear"
1448,MISERIES.,smiling and hospitable. I go out to pass a social afternoon with a
1449,MISERIES.,"friend, and am set down in a room just above the freezing-point, with"
1450,MISERIES.,"a little crack opened in the window, and all the doors flying, to"
1451,MISERIES.,"_change the air_. I ride in the omnibus, and am almost choked with my"
1452,MISERIES.,"bonnet-strings, such a furious draught meets me in the face, and when,"
1453,MISERIES.,"with infinite pains, I have secured the only tolerably warm corner, my"
1454,MISERIES.,"next neighbor becomes very faint, and must have the window open. Even"
1455,MISERIES.,the poor babies are not safe from this popular insanity. You may see
1456,MISERIES.,"the little victims any day, taking an airing, with their little red"
1457,MISERIES.,noses and watery eyes peeping forth from under the cap and
1458,MISERIES.,"feathers. The old-fashioned blanket, in which the baby was done up"
1459,MISERIES.,"head and all, like a bundle, is thrown aside. The child is not quite"
1460,MISERIES.,"so often carried upside down. I suppose, under the new system, but"
1461,MISERIES.,what difference does it make whether the poor thing is smothered or
1462,MISERIES.,frozen to death?
1463,MISERIES.,
1464,MISERIES.,I never shall forget a long journey I took once with a friend who was
1465,MISERIES.,raving mad on the subject of fresh air and cold water. Every morning
1466,MISERIES.,"the windows were thrown wide open, and the blinds flung back with an"
1467,MISERIES.,"energetic bang, while a stiff wintry wind whirled every thing about"
1468,MISERIES.,"the room, and flapped the curtains against the ceiling. And there she"
1469,MISERIES.,"stood, declaring herself exhilarated, while her nose and lips turned"
1470,MISERIES.,"from red to blue, and the tears ran down her cheeks. I always took to"
1471,MISERIES.,flight. Afterwards the poor auto-martyr went out to walk before
1472,MISERIES.,"breakfast, scornfully rejecting all offers of furs and extra"
1473,MISERIES.,"wrappings. O dear, no! _She_ never thought of muffs, tippets,"
1474,MISERIES.,"snow-boots, but as encumbrances fit for extreme old age and"
1475,MISERIES.,"infirmity. She always walked fast, and the more the wind blew, the"
1476,MISERIES.,"warmer she felt, I might be assured. As soon as she had gone, I"
1477,MISERIES.,"established myself in comfort by the side of a glowing grate, happy"
1478,MISERIES.,but for dreading her return. She came in dreadfully fresh and breezy
1479,MISERIES.,"from the outer air, very energetic, very noisy, and fully bent upon"
1480,MISERIES.,stirring me up and making me take exercise. After snapping the door
1481,MISERIES.,open and slamming it behind her with a clap that greatly disturbed my
1482,MISERIES.,"nerves, she exclaimed in a stentorian voice, ""O dear me! I shall _die_"
1483,MISERIES.,"in such an oven! My dear child, you have no idea how hot it is!"" And"
1484,MISERIES.,"the first thing I knew, up would go a window with a crash that made"
1485,MISERIES.,the weights rattle. It might rain or shine; weather made no difference
1486,MISERIES.,to this inveterate air-seeker. Many a time has she come in all
1487,MISERIES.,"dripping, and tracking the carpet, brushed carelessly against me with"
1488,MISERIES.,"her wet garments, and finally enveloped me with the steam arising from"
1489,MISERIES.,them as they hung around my fire. It roused my indignation that she
1490,MISERIES.,"should make herself and every body else so uncomfortable, and then"
1491,MISERIES.,glory in the deed as if it were indubitably and indisputably
1492,MISERIES.,"praiseworthy. She was so good-natured, however, and so happy in her"
1493,MISERIES.,"delusion, that I could not find it in my heart to remonstrate very"
1494,MISERIES.,"vehemently, except when she would make me listen to her interminable"
1495,MISERIES.,"lectures upon the importance, the _necessity_, of fresh air, and the"
1496,MISERIES.,"effect of a snug, cosy room upon the blood, the heart, the lungs, the"
1497,MISERIES.,"head, and (as I verily believe she hinted) _the temper_. I know I lost"
1498,MISERIES.,all control of _mine_ long before she finished; but whether it was the
1499,MISERIES.,"want of fresh air in practice, or too much of it in theory, I leave"
1500,MISERIES.,you to imagine.
1501,MISERIES.,
1502,MISERIES.,"My friend always carried a small thermometer in her trunk, which she"
1503,MISERIES.,"consulted a dozen times an hour, in order to regulate the temperature"
1504,MISERIES.,of the room. Alas for me if the quicksilver rose above 60!  I devoutly
1505,MISERIES.,hoped she would leave it behind in some of our numerous
1506,MISERIES.,"stopping-places, and with an eye to that possibility, I must confess,"
1507,MISERIES.,I hung it in the most out-of-the-way corners I could find; but it
1508,MISERIES.,"seemed to be on her mind continually. She never forgot it, and always"
1509,MISERIES.,"packed it very carefully, too. I asked her two or three times to let"
1510,MISERIES.,"me put it in _my_ trunk, where I had slyly arranged a nice little"
1511,MISERIES.,"place full of hard surfaces and sharp corners, but she always had"
1512,MISERIES.,plenty of room.

1591,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,benefit from the act. For the ordinary and inevitable surprises of
1592,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,every-day life are sufficiently frequent and startling to content even
1593,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,the most romantic disposition; entirely dispensing with the necessity
1594,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"of those artfully contrived, embarrassing little plots which one's"
1595,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"friends occasionally set in motion, greatly to their own diversion and"
1596,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,the extreme discomfort of the surprised unfortunate. For he who has
1597,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"ever broken his skull on a treacherous sidewalk, or received from the"
1598,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"post a dunning missive when he expected a love-letter, or arrived one"
1599,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"minute late at the car-station, or taken a desperately bad bill in"
1600,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"exchange for good silver, or been caught in a thunderstorm with white"
1601,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"pantaloons and no umbrella, knows that the unavoidable surprises of"
1602,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"life are in themselves staggerers of quite frequent occurrence, and"
1603,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,require not the aid of human invention. But the surprises which we
1604,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,most dread are not those which _naturally_ fall to us as part of the
1605,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,misfortune we are born to inherit; not those which result from
1606,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"unforeseen accidental circumstances, from carelessness on our own part"
1607,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"or from the folly of others, from revolutions in the elements or in"
1608,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"the affairs of nations; these we _can_ bear, by using against them the"
1609,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"best remedies we possess, or by viewing and enduring them as wisdom"
1610,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"and philosophy teach us to do. No; our only prayer, in this"
1611,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"connection, is that we may be saved from our friends; not from their"
1612,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"carelessness, but from their deliberate schemes against our security."
1613,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,
1614,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"In order to reconcile this apparent contradiction in terms, take the"
1615,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,following instance of a friendly propensity. You walk into your house
1616,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"at dusky twilight, at that particular hour of evening at which your"
1617,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"_own brother_, if he be a reasonable being, would not expect you to"
1618,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,recognize him; one of your family extends his (or her) head from the
1619,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"parlor, and calls upon you at once to enter, and greet ""an old"
1620,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"friend."" You obey, and are immediately confronted with an individual"
1621,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,whose countenance wears an expression associated with some
1622,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"reminiscences of your youth, but so dim and undefined is it, that you"
1623,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"cannot, for the life of you, give it its appropriate name or"
1624,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,place. What is to be done? The recollections of early childhood are
1625,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,expected spontaneously to burst forth from under a heap of later and
1626,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"more vivid associations, and the name, residence, business, and whole"
1627,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,history of the unwelcome guest are called upon to suggest themselves
1628,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,within a second's time.
1629,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,
1630,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"After a long moment of painful hesitation, during which you have in"
1631,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"vain tried to _stare_ his name out of him, you clutch at a struggling"
1632,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"idea, and blurt out the name of one of your former associates. You do"
1633,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"this, not by any means because common sense or conviction suggest the"
1634,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"course, but simply because something must instantly be done. The"
1635,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"result, of course, is, that you hit upon the wrong name; and now your"
1636,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"kind friends can do no more for you; even if they rush to the rescue,"
1637,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"and formally introduce the stranger, it is of no avail. The deed is"
1638,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"done; you are placed in a position of awkward mortification, which"
1639,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"both the stranger and yourself will never forget, and never cease to"
1640,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,regret.
1641,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,
1642,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,Why it is that the feeling of shame which follows upon such mishaps
1643,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"attaches itself exclusively to the innocent sufferers, rather than to"
1644,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"those who are the cause of the suffering, I never could"
1645,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,understand. This kind of diversion betrays a want of humane
1646,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,consideration in the contriver. It is infinitely more cruel and
1647,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"unamiable than Spanish bull-baitings, or the gladiatorial shows of the"
1648,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"ancients, inasmuch as a shock to the finest feelings of human nature"
1649,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,"is harder to bear, and longer in duration, than the momentary pang"
1650,INNOCENT SURPRISES.,induced by witnessing a merely physical suffering.

1655,THE OLD SAILOR.,THE OLD SAILOR.
1656,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1657,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1658,THE OLD SAILOR.,In my school vacations I used occasionally to visit an old sailor
1659,THE OLD SAILOR.,"friend, a man of uncommon natural gifts, and that varied experience of"
1660,THE OLD SAILOR.,life which does so much to supply the want of other means of
1661,THE OLD SAILOR.,"education. He must have been a handsome man in his youth, and though"
1662,THE OLD SAILOR.,time and hardship had done their utmost to make a ruin of his bold
1663,THE OLD SAILOR.,"features, and had made it needful to braid his still jetty black locks"
1664,THE OLD SAILOR.,"together to cover his bald crown, his was a fine, striking head yet,"
1665,THE OLD SAILOR.,"to my boyish fancy. I loved to sit at his feet, and hear him tell the"
1666,THE OLD SAILOR.,"events of sixty years of toil and danger, suffering and well-earned"
1667,THE OLD SAILOR.,"joy, as he leaned with both hands upon his stout staff, his body"
1668,THE OLD SAILOR.,swaying with the earnestness of his speech. His labors and perils were
1669,THE OLD SAILOR.,"now ended, and in his age and infirmity he had found a quiet haven. He"
1670,THE OLD SAILOR.,"had built a small house by the side of the home of his childhood, and"
1671,THE OLD SAILOR.,"his son, who followed his father's vocation, lived under the same"
1672,THE OLD SAILOR.,roof. This son and two daughters were all that remained to him of a
1673,THE OLD SAILOR.,large family.
1674,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1675,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""An easterly bank and a westerly glim are certain signs of a wet"
1676,THE OLD SAILOR.,"skin!"" said the fisherman, pointing to the heavy black masses of cloud"
1677,THE OLD SAILOR.,"that hung over the eastern horizon, one morning when I had risen at"
1678,THE OLD SAILOR.,"sunrise for a day's fishing. ""'T won't do; don't go out to-day!"
1679,THE OLD SAILOR.,"There's soon such a breeze off shore, as, with the heavy chop, would"
1680,THE OLD SAILOR.,"make you sick enough! Besides, the old dory won't put up with such a"
1681,THE OLD SAILOR.,"storm as is coming. No fishing, my boy, to-day."""
1682,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1683,THE OLD SAILOR.,"His old father said, ""Stephen is right. There is a blow brewing."" And"
1684,THE OLD SAILOR.,"he came to look, leaning on his cane. ""Stay in to-day."""
1685,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1686,THE OLD SAILOR.,"I yielded, and the sky during the morning slowly assumed a dull,"
1687,THE OLD SAILOR.,"leaden hue. The storm came on in the afternoon, heavily pattering, and"
1688,THE OLD SAILOR.,"pouring, and blowing against the windows, and obscuring the little"
1689,THE OLD SAILOR.,light of an autumn twilight. I wandered through the few small rooms of
1690,THE OLD SAILOR.,"the cottage, endeavoring to amuse myself, while the light lasted, with"
1691,THE OLD SAILOR.,"two funeral sermons and an old newspaper. Then I sat down at a window,"
1692,THE OLD SAILOR.,"and I well remember the gloomy landscape, seen through the rain, in"
1693,THE OLD SAILOR.,"the dusk:--the marsh, with the creek dividing it, the bare round"
1694,THE OLD SAILOR.,"eminence between the house and the beach, or rather the rocky cliffs,"
1695,THE OLD SAILOR.,"and on either side the wide, lonely sands, with heavy foam-capped"
1696,THE OLD SAILOR.,"breakers rolling in upon the shore, with a sound like a solemn"
1697,THE OLD SAILOR.,"dirge. At a distance on the left, half hidden by the walnut-trees, lay"
1698,THE OLD SAILOR.,"the ruins of a mill, which had always the air of being haunted. A"
1699,THE OLD SAILOR.,"high, rocky hill, very nearly perpendicular on the side next the"
1700,THE OLD SAILOR.,"house, was covered on the sides and top with junipers, pines, and"
1701,THE OLD SAILOR.,"other evergreens. As the darkness thickened, I left the lonely ""best"
1702,THE OLD SAILOR.,"room"" for the seat in the large chimney-corner, in the kitchen. The"
1703,THE OLD SAILOR.,"old wife tottered round, making preparations for the evening meal, and"
1704,THE OLD SAILOR.,muttered recollections of shipwrecks which the storm brought to her
1705,THE OLD SAILOR.,"mind. Now and then she would go to a window, turn back her cap-border"
1706,THE OLD SAILOR.,"from her forehead, put her face close to the glass, shading off the"
1707,THE OLD SAILOR.,"firelight with her hand, and gaze out into the darkness."
1708,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1709,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""Asa did not go out either, thank the good Father!"" she said. The dog"
1710,THE OLD SAILOR.,"whined piteously. ""St! St! Poor Scip! Here, shall have a piece! Good"
1711,THE OLD SAILOR.,"dog! A fearful night indeed it is."""
1712,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1713,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The two men came in from the barn, shook off the wet, and drew near"
1714,THE OLD SAILOR.,the fire.
1715,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1716,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""Just such a night, twenty-nine years ago come August, we ran afoul of"
1717,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Hatteras. You remember, old woman, how they frighted ye about me,"
1718,THE OLD SAILOR.,"don't ye?"""
1719,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1720,THE OLD SAILOR.,Amidst such reminiscences we were called to supper. I remember being
1721,THE OLD SAILOR.,"solemnly impressed when that old man, bent with hardship and the"
1722,THE OLD SAILOR.,"weight of years, clasped his hands reverently, and in rude terms, but"
1723,THE OLD SAILOR.,"full of meaning, asked a blessing upon their humble board. I remember"
1724,THE OLD SAILOR.,"the flickering light from the logs burning on the hearth, and how it"
1725,THE OLD SAILOR.,"showed, upon the faces of those who sat there, a strong feeling of the"
1726,THE OLD SAILOR.,words in which rose an added petition in behalf of those on the mighty
1727,THE OLD SAILOR.,deep.
1728,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1729,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Supper being ended, the old man took down the tobacco-board, and, when"
1730,THE OLD SAILOR.,"he had cut enough to fill his pipe, handed it to his son, who, having"
1731,THE OLD SAILOR.,"done the same, restored it to its nail in the chimney-corner.  Then"
1732,THE OLD SAILOR.,"they smoked, and talked of dangers braved and overcome, of pirates,"
1733,THE OLD SAILOR.,"and shipwrecks, and escapes, till I involuntarily drew closer into my"
1734,THE OLD SAILOR.,"corner, and looked over my shoulder. Suddenly the dog under the table"
1735,THE OLD SAILOR.,gave a whining growl.
1736,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1737,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""I never seed the like o' that dog,"" exclaimed the fisherman, turning"
1738,THE OLD SAILOR.,"to me. ""I thought he was asleep. But if ever a foot comes nigh the"
1739,THE OLD SAILOR.,"house at night, he gives notice. Depend on it, there's some one"
1740,THE OLD SAILOR.,"coming."""
1741,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1742,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The door of the little entry opened, with a rush of the whistling"
1743,THE OLD SAILOR.,"wind, and a man stepped in. The dog half rose, and though he wagged"
1744,THE OLD SAILOR.,"his tail, in token that he knew the step to be that of a friend, he"
1745,THE OLD SAILOR.,"kept up a low whine. A young man, muffled to the eyes, and with the"
1746,THE OLD SAILOR.,"water dripping from his huge pea-jacket, opened the kitchen-door."
1747,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1748,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""William Crosby, why, what brings you out in such a storm as this?"
1749,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Strip off your coat, and draw up to the fire, can't ye? Where are you"
1750,THE OLD SAILOR.,"bound, then, and the night as dark as a wolf's throat?"""
1751,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1752,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The young fisherman made no answer, unless by a motion of his hand. As"
1753,THE OLD SAILOR.,"he turned back the collar from his face, we saw by the waving light"
1754,THE OLD SAILOR.,that it was pale as death. The long wet locks already lay upon his
1755,THE OLD SAILOR.,"cheeks, making them more ghastly as he struggled to speak. ""O Stephen"
1756,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Lee, it's no time to be sitting by the fire, when old Asa Osborn is"
1757,THE OLD SAILOR.,rolling in the waters. A man's drownded; and who's to get the body for
1758,THE OLD SAILOR.,the wife and the children--God pity them!--afore the ebb carries it
1759,THE OLD SAILOR.,"out to sea?"""
1760,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1761,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The old man drew his hand across his forehead, and rose. I looked at"
1762,THE OLD SAILOR.,"him as he drew up his tall figure, and looked the young messenger full"
1763,THE OLD SAILOR.,"in the eye. In a low, deep whisper, he said, ""Who, William, did ye"
1764,THE OLD SAILOR.,"say? You said a man's drownded,--but tell me the name again."""
1765,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1766,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""Yes, Gran'sir, I did say it. Old Uncle Ase Flemming, he and the"
1767,THE OLD SAILOR.,minister went out a fishing in the morning. The minister got his boots
1768,THE OLD SAILOR.,"off in the water, and after a long time he's swum ashore. But poor"
1769,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Uncle Ase--. Stephen, come along. His poor wife's gone down to the"
1770,THE OLD SAILOR.,"beach, now."""
1771,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1772,THE OLD SAILOR.,"They left the house, and I shut the door after them, and came back"
1773,THE OLD SAILOR.,softly to my seat by the old man's knee.
1774,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1775,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Once before I had seen him, when a heavy sorrow fell upon him. It was"
1776,THE OLD SAILOR.,"on a beautiful summer's day, and the open window let in the cool"
1777,THE OLD SAILOR.,"breeze from the sea. He was sitting by it in his arm-chair, looking"
1778,THE OLD SAILOR.,"out upon the calm water, buried in thought. His favorite daughter had"
1779,THE OLD SAILOR.,"long been very low, and might sink away at any moment. The old dog was"
1780,THE OLD SAILOR.,"at his feet asleep. The clock ticked in the corner, and the sun was"
1781,THE OLD SAILOR.,"shining upon the floor. Some friends sat by in silence, with sorrowful"
1782,THE OLD SAILOR.,"countenances. His little grandchild came to his side, and said,"
1783,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""Mother says, tell Grandpa Aunt Lucy's gone home."""
1784,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1785,THE OLD SAILOR.,The old man did not alter his position. For some time he sat in deep
1786,THE OLD SAILOR.,"thought, looking out with unseeing gaze, and winding his thumbs, as"
1787,THE OLD SAILOR.,"before. Of five fair daughters, three had before died by the same"
1788,THE OLD SAILOR.,"disease, consumption. He had seen them slowly fade away, one by one,"
1789,THE OLD SAILOR.,and had followed his children to the grave in the secluded
1790,THE OLD SAILOR.,"burying-ground, where the green sod was now to be broken to receive"
1791,THE OLD SAILOR.,the fourth.
1792,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1793,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Rising slowly, he walked across the room, and, taking the well-worn"
1794,THE OLD SAILOR.,"family Bible, returned with it to his seat; and, as he turned the"
1795,THE OLD SAILOR.,"leaves, he said in a low tone to himself, ""There's only one left now!"""
1796,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Then he sat entirely silent, with his eyes fixed upon the sacred"
1797,THE OLD SAILOR.,"page. He did not utter one word of lamentation, he did not shed a"
1798,THE OLD SAILOR.,"tear, but as he turned his eye on me, in passing, its expression went"
1799,THE OLD SAILOR.,"to my heart.  Stealing softly out, I left him to the silent Comforter"
1800,THE OLD SAILOR.,whose blessing is on the mourner.
1801,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1802,THE OLD SAILOR.,Now the scene was changed. One was suddenly taken from his side who
1803,THE OLD SAILOR.,had been a companion from boyhood to old age. They had played and
1804,THE OLD SAILOR.,"worked in company; together they had embarked on their first voyage,"
1805,THE OLD SAILOR.,and their last; and they had settled down in close neighborhood in the
1806,THE OLD SAILOR.,evening of their days. Each had preserved the other's life in some
1807,THE OLD SAILOR.,"moment of peril, but took small praise to himself for so simple an act"
1808,THE OLD SAILOR.,of duty. Few words of fondness had ever passed between them. They had
1809,THE OLD SAILOR.,"gone along the path of life, without perhaps being conscious of any"
1810,THE OLD SAILOR.,"peculiarly strong tie of friendship binding them together, till they"
1811,THE OLD SAILOR.,"were thus torn asunder. The death of a daughter, long and slowly"
1812,THE OLD SAILOR.,"wasting away before his eyes, could be calmly borne. But this blow was"
1813,THE OLD SAILOR.,"wholly unforeseen, and his chest heavily rose and fell, and by the"
1814,THE OLD SAILOR.,bright firelight I saw tears rolling over his weather-beaten cheeks.
1815,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1816,THE OLD SAILOR.,"""A child will weep a bramble's smart,"
1817,THE OLD SAILOR.,"A maid to see her sparrow part,"
1818,THE OLD SAILOR.,A stripling for a woman's heart;
1819,THE OLD SAILOR.,"Talk not of grief, till thou hast seen"
1820,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The hard-drawn tears of bearded men."""
1821,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1822,THE OLD SAILOR.,"The fury of the storm being abated, I resolved to follow Stephen down"
1823,THE OLD SAILOR.,"to the shore. He was not in sight, and I knew not what direction to"
1824,THE OLD SAILOR.,"take. It was a gloomy night, the transient glimpses of the moon"
1825,THE OLD SAILOR.,between driving masses of clouds only making the scene more wild and
1826,THE OLD SAILOR.,appalling. I could see the tops of the tall trees bending under the
1827,THE OLD SAILOR.,"fury of the blast, ere it came to sweep the beach. The heaving billows"
1828,THE OLD SAILOR.,"were covered with foam, far as the eye could reach, and, rising and"
1829,THE OLD SAILOR.,"tumbling, seemed striving with each other as they rolled on towards"
1830,THE OLD SAILOR.,"the sands. I had seen storms upon the ocean before, but never had it"
1831,THE OLD SAILOR.,presented so awful and majestic an appearance. As the breakers struck
1832,THE OLD SAILOR.,"upon the shore, and sent a huge mass of water upon the sands, their"
1833,THE OLD SAILOR.,"sullen roar mingled with the howling and rushing of the wind, and"
1834,THE OLD SAILOR.,filled me with awe.
1835,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1836,THE OLD SAILOR.,"There were torches upon the beach, and as I drew near, I saw the"
1837,THE OLD SAILOR.,fishermen run together to one point. The body had just been washed
1838,THE OLD SAILOR.,"ashore, and lay stretched upon the sands. The head was bare, and long"
1839,THE OLD SAILOR.,locks of white hair streamed down upon the shoulders. The heavy
1840,THE OLD SAILOR.,"pea-jacket was off from one arm, as if he had endeavored to extricate"
1841,THE OLD SAILOR.,himself from it in the water. The sinewy arms lay powerless and free
1842,THE OLD SAILOR.,"from tension then, but they told me that, when they first drew him"
1843,THE OLD SAILOR.,"from the surf, both hands were grasping a broken oar with such"
1844,THE OLD SAILOR.,"strength that they were unable to loose his hold, till suddenly the"
1845,THE OLD SAILOR.,"muscles relaxed, and the arms fell upon the ground. They turned the"
1846,THE OLD SAILOR.,"body, and a little water ran from the mouth. Then, gently raising it"
1847,THE OLD SAILOR.,"upon their shoulders, they bore it home."
1848,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1849,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1850,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1851,THE OLD SAILOR.,
1852,LAUGHTER.,LAUGHTER.
1853,LAUGHTER.,
1854,LAUGHTER.,
1855,LAUGHTER.,In some individuals the risibles lie so near the surface that you may
1856,LAUGHTER.,"tickle them with a feather. In others, they are so deeply imbedded in"
1857,LAUGHTER.,"phlegm, or so protected by the crust of ill-humor, that a strong"
1858,LAUGHTER.,thrust and a keen weapon are required to reach them.
1859,LAUGHTER.,
1860,LAUGHTER.,A laugh is in itself a different thing in different individuals.  Some
1861,LAUGHTER.,"persons laugh inwardly, unsocially, bitterly. It is a pure grimace on"
1862,LAUGHTER.,"your part when you join in their merriment, unless you are superior to"
1863,LAUGHTER.,"the fear of ridicule. On the other hand, there is a laugh of so"
1864,LAUGHTER.,"contagious a nature, that you are irresistibly moved to sympathy while"
1865,LAUGHTER.,"ignorant of the exciting cause, or out of the sphere of its"
1866,LAUGHTER.,"influence. You will laugh loud and long, and afterwards confess that"
1867,LAUGHTER.,"you had not the least gleam of a funny idea, all the while."
1868,LAUGHTER.,
1869,LAUGHTER.,You doubt the power of the sympathetic laugh? Come with me into the
1870,LAUGHTER.,"nursery. Here is a rosy little horror, a year and a half old. Sit down"
1871,LAUGHTER.,"and take him upon your knees. Hold his dimpled hands in yours, and"
1872,LAUGHTER.,"look steadily into his roguish eyes. Repeat a nursery rhyme, no matter"
1873,LAUGHTER.,"what, in a humdrum recitative; he is sober, and very attentive."
1874,LAUGHTER.,"Suddenly spring a mine upon him with a ""Boo!"" His ""Hicketty-hick!"""
1875,LAUGHTER.,"follows, and his eyes begin to shine. Repeat the experiment."
1876,LAUGHTER.,"""Hicketty-hick!"" again, more heartily than at first, with the baby"
1877,LAUGHTER.,"encore, ""Adin!"" The same process awakens the rapturous little pearls"
1878,LAUGHTER.,"again and again, and you are quite in the spirit of the thing"
1879,LAUGHTER.,yourself. Now for a more ecstatic burst. You purposely prolong his
1880,LAUGHTER.,"suspense; he is all atilt, expecting the delightful surprise. You"
1881,LAUGHTER.,"drawl out each word; you drone the ditty over and over again, till"
1882,LAUGHTER.,"every tiny nerve is tense with expectation. ""Boo!"" at last, and over"
1883,LAUGHTER.,"he goes, in the complete _abandon_ of baby glee; his cherry lips are"
1884,LAUGHTER.,"wide asunder, his head hangs powerless back, and the ""Hicketty-hicks"""
1885,LAUGHTER.,"burst tumultuously from his little, beating throat. And _you_, sir;"
1886,LAUGHTER.,"what are _you_ doing?  Laughing, I declare, in full roar, till the"
1887,LAUGHTER.,"tears run down your cheeks. You catch the boy in your arms, toss him,"
1888,LAUGHTER.,"almost throttle him with kisses, and so enhance the merry spasms, that"
1889,LAUGHTER.,"mamma, who has a philosophical instinct with regard to excited nerves,"
1890,LAUGHTER.,"and dreads the reaction, comes to the rescue."
1891,LAUGHTER.,
1892,LAUGHTER.,Let me introduce you to another effective laughter. You shall not hear
1893,LAUGHTER.,"a sound, yet you cannot choose but laugh, if she does, quiet as she is"
1894,LAUGHTER.,"about it. See how her shoulders shake,--and look at her face!  Every"
1895,LAUGHTER.,feature is instinct with mirth; the color mounts to the roots of the
1896,LAUGHTER.,hair; the curls vibrate; the eyes sparkle through tears; the white
1897,LAUGHTER.,teeth glisten; the very nose and ears seem to take a part; like
1898,LAUGHTER.,"Nourmahal, she ""laughs all over,"" and while you wonder what the joke"
1899,LAUGHTER.,"may be, you are laughing too."
1900,LAUGHTER.,

1969,THE OLD CHURCH.,There are certain old-fashioned people who find fault with the
1970,THE OLD CHURCH.,"luxuriousness of our churches, and ascribe to the warmth and comfort,"
1971,THE OLD CHURCH.,"which contrast so strongly with the hardships of early times, the"
1972,THE OLD CHURCH.,"acknowledged sleepiness of modern congregations. For my part, I see no"
1973,THE OLD CHURCH.,"necessary connection between discomfort and devotion. _My_ soul, at"
1974,THE OLD CHURCH.,"least, sympathizes so much with its physical adjunct, that, when the"
1975,THE OLD CHURCH.,"latter is uncomfortable, the former is never quite free and active."
1976,THE OLD CHURCH.,
1977,THE OLD CHURCH.,"Let me call to remembrance the church my childhood knew, with its"
1978,THE OLD CHURCH.,"capacious square pews, in which half the audience turned their backs"
1979,THE OLD CHURCH.,"upon the minister; the seats made to rise and fall, for the"
1980,THE OLD CHURCH.,"convenience of standing, and which closed every prayer with a clap of"
1981,THE OLD CHURCH.,"thunder; its many aisles, like streets and lanes; the old men's seats,"
1982,THE OLD CHURCH.,"and the queer but venerable figures that were seen in them,--some with"
1983,THE OLD CHURCH.,black-silk caps to protect their bald heads from the freezing draughts
1984,THE OLD CHURCH.,"of air from the porchless doors; the old women's seats, on the"
1985,THE OLD CHURCH.,"opposite side; the elevated row of pews round the sides of the church,"
1986,THE OLD CHURCH.,and the envied position of certain little children who had an
1987,THE OLD CHURCH.,"extensive prospect through the open pew-top within doors, and a view"
1988,THE OLD CHURCH.,of the hay-scales and the town-pump through the window besides. Those
1989,THE OLD CHURCH.,"windows, in a double row, with the gallery between,--how regularly I"
1990,THE OLD CHURCH.,"counted the small panes, always forgetting the number, to make the"
1991,THE OLD CHURCH.,"same weary task necessary every Sunday! The singing-seats, projecting"
1992,THE OLD CHURCH.,"from the central portion of the gallery, furnished me with another"
1993,THE OLD CHURCH.,"hebdomadal study, in large gilt letters of antique awkwardness, which"
1994,THE OLD CHURCH.,so impressed themselves on my mind that I see them now. This was the
1995,THE OLD CHURCH.,"golden legend: ""BUILT, 1770. ENLARGED, 1795."" I remember hearing a wag"
1996,THE OLD CHURCH.,"propose to add as another remarkable fact, ""SCOURED, 1818."""
1997,THE OLD CHURCH.,
1998,THE OLD CHURCH.,"Opposite to the singing-seats towered the pulpit, from which the"
1999,THE OLD CHURCH.,clergyman looked down upon us like a sparrow upon the house-top. He
2000,THE OLD CHURCH.,seemed in perpetual danger of being extinguished by a huge
2001,THE OLD CHURCH.,sounding-board. Very earnestly I used to gaze at the slender point by
2002,THE OLD CHURCH.,"which it hung suspended, and wished, if it _must_ come down, that I"
2003,THE OLD CHURCH.,"might make the gilt ornament at the apex, resembling a vase turned"
2004,THE OLD CHURCH.,"upside down, my prize. Under the pulpit was a closet, which some one"
2005,THE OLD CHURCH.,veraciously assured me was the place where the tithingman imprisoned
2006,THE OLD CHURCH.,"incautiously playful urchins.  The terrors of that dark, mysterious"
2007,THE OLD CHURCH.,"cell had little effect on my conduct, however, as I was not entirely"
2008,THE OLD CHURCH.,convinced of the existence of any such lynx-eyed functionary.
2009,THE OLD CHURCH.,
2010,THE OLD CHURCH.,"The largest church in the county, it was, however, well filled, many"
2011,THE OLD CHURCH.,"of the congregation coming five and some even six miles, and remaining"
2012,THE OLD CHURCH.,"there through the noon intermission, which, on their account, was made"
2013,THE OLD CHURCH.,as short as possible. But in winter the vast airy space had a peculiar
2014,THE OLD CHURCH.,"and searching chill. No barn could be colder, except that the numerous"
2015,THE OLD CHURCH.,footstoves made some little change in the air during service. The
2016,THE OLD CHURCH.,minister stood upon a heated slab of soap-stone. I used to watch this
2017,THE OLD CHURCH.,"in its progress up the broad aisle and the pulpit stairs, under the"
2018,THE OLD CHURCH.,"arm of the boy from the parsonage, and the irreverent way in which he"
2019,THE OLD CHURCH.,"made his descent, in view of the assembly, after depositing his"
2020,THE OLD CHURCH.,"burden, was thus rebuked by an old lady who was always droll and"
2021,THE OLD CHURCH.,"quaint. ""Why, Matthew, when you come down the pulpit stairs of a"

2024,THE OLD CHURCH.,
2025,THE OLD CHURCH.,"Older grew the church, and colder; and if people then staid at home on"
2026,THE OLD CHURCH.,"Sunday afternoons, they had a better excuse for doing so than their"
2027,THE OLD CHURCH.,"successors can muster. The chorister, even, was frequently among the"
2028,THE OLD CHURCH.,"missing, but was charitably supposed to be subject to the ague."
2029,THE OLD CHURCH.,Efforts were made to prevail upon the elderly part of the parish to
2030,THE OLD CHURCH.,permit the introduction of stoves with long funnels. They scorned the
2031,THE OLD CHURCH.,"enervating luxury! Their fathers had worshipped in the cold, and their"
2032,THE OLD CHURCH.,sons might. But ah! how degenerate were the descendants of the noble
2033,THE OLD CHURCH.,old Puritan church-goers! The services curtailed to half their proper
2034,THE OLD CHURCH.,"length, yet finding the patience of the listeners all too short! The"
2035,THE OLD CHURCH.,"degenerate descendants carried the day, however, the most bigoted of"
2036,THE OLD CHURCH.,"their opposers becoming disabled by rheumatism. The old sexton,"
2037,THE OLD CHURCH.,resignation to inevitable evils being a lesson he had had much
2038,THE OLD CHURCH.,"opportunity to learn, submitted with a good grace, though very much of"
2039,THE OLD CHURCH.,opinion that fires in a church were an absurdity and a waste. The
2040,THE OLD CHURCH.,"stoves were provided, and an uncommonly full attendance the next"
2041,THE OLD CHURCH.,Sabbath showed the very general interest the matter had excited. How
2042,THE OLD CHURCH.,would it seem? Would any one faint?
2043,THE OLD CHURCH.,
2044,THE OLD CHURCH.,There was by no means a superabundance of heat; there was something
2045,THE OLD CHURCH.,"wrong, but the lack of warmth was a hundred-fold made up in smoke. No"
2046,THE OLD CHURCH.,"one could see across the church, and the minister loomed up, as if in"
2047,THE OLD CHURCH.,a dense fog; all eyes were fountains of tears. At last the old sexton
2048,THE OLD CHURCH.,"went with a slow and subdued step up to the pulpit, and, wiping his"
2049,THE OLD CHURCH.,"eyes, respectfully inquired, in a whisper, whether there was not a"
2050,THE OLD CHURCH.,_little_ too much smoke. This suggestion being very smilingly assented
2051,THE OLD CHURCH.,"to, he proceeded to extinguish the fires, and for that day the"
2052,THE OLD CHURCH.,services were not indebted to artificial warmth to promote their
2053,THE OLD CHURCH.,effect.
2054,THE OLD CHURCH.,
2055,THE OLD CHURCH.,How sad are improvements in places to which our childish recollections
2056,THE OLD CHURCH.,cling! The gushing fulness of unchilled love is lavished even on
2057,THE OLD CHURCH.,"inanimate and senseless things, in a happy childhood. How was my heart"
2058,THE OLD CHURCH.,grieved when the old-fashioned meeting-house was converted into the
2059,THE OLD CHURCH.,"modern temple! Time and decay had rendered the tall spire unsafe, yet"
2060,THE OLD CHURCH.,its fall by force and premeditated purpose seemed a sacrilege. I felt
2061,THE OLD CHURCH.,"affronted for the huge weathercock, reclining sulkily against a fence,"
2062,THE OLD CHURCH.,no more to point his beak to the east with obstinate preference. I
2063,THE OLD CHURCH.,"mourned over the broad, old-fashioned dial, on which young eyes could"
2064,THE OLD CHURCH.,"discern the time a mile off. The old sexton lived to see this change,"
2065,THE OLD CHURCH.,and at the end of half a century of care under that venerable roof he
2066,THE OLD CHURCH.,"went to his rest. The beloved minister, and many, many who sat with"
2067,THE OLD CHURCH.,"trustful and devoted hearts under his teachings, are gone to their"
2068,THE OLD CHURCH.,"reward. A board from the old pulpit, a piece of the red-damask"
2069,THE OLD CHURCH.,"curtain, and the long wished-for gold vase, are now in my possession."

2376,FASHION.,
2377,FASHION.,Why is it that the introduction of a really graceful fashion is
2378,FASHION.,"generally met with ridicule and opposition, while ugly modes are"
2379,FASHION.,adopted with grave acquiescence and reverent submission?
2380,FASHION.,
2381,FASHION.,"""Seest thou not what a deformed thief this _Fashion_ is?"" ""I know that"
2382,FASHION.,"Deformed; he goes up and down like a gentleman."" Yes, we all know"
2383,FASHION.,"_Deformed_. When any of his family come to us, from England or France"
2384,FASHION.,"or any foreign country, we recognize the hideous brotherhood, and"
2385,FASHION.,extend our welcoming hands; but _Graceful_ must stay with us a long
2386,FASHION.,"time to be greeted kindly, and her sisters from foreign parts are"
2387,FASHION.,"coldly looked upon, or dismissed at once."
2388,FASHION.,
2389,FASHION.,"To begin at the top,--""the very head and front of the offending.""  A"
2390,FASHION.,"gentleman goes into a fashionable hatter's, and the shopman, holding"
2391,FASHION.,"up for admiration a hat with a crown a foot high, of the genuine"
2392,FASHION.,"stove-pipe form, and a brim an inch wide, says, ""This is the newest"
2393,FASHION.,"style, Sir."" The gentleman walks home with the ugly thing on his head,"
2394,FASHION.,"but no one stares or laughs. 'Tis a new fashion, but all ""take it"
2395,FASHION.,"easy."" A year later, perhaps, the hatter shows him a thing with a brim"
2396,FASHION.,"a half an inch wider, but rolled up at the sides, and a crown of a"
2397,FASHION.,"much greater diameter at the top than where it joins the brim,--a"
2398,FASHION.,"specimen of the bell-crown. This is solemnly donned, and the wearer"
2399,FASHION.,has the pleasure of knowing that the head-gear of all his friends is
2400,FASHION.,"as hideous as his own. The inverted cone is worn with a sweet,"
2401,FASHION.,"Malvolio smile. And so ""Deformed"" has ruled the head of man for as"
2402,FASHION.,"many years as any of us can number, only ringing the changes, from one"
2403,FASHION.,"year to another, upon the three degrees of comparison of the word"
2404,FASHION.,_ugly_.
2405,FASHION.,
2406,FASHION.,"But a change takes place; a light, graceful, low-crowned hat, with a"
2407,FASHION.,"brim wide enough for shelter or for shade, begins to appear as a"
2408,FASHION.,fashion;--and how is it received? The clergyman thinks it would be
2409,FASHION.,"very unclerical for him to wear it, though it may be as black, and is"
2410,FASHION.,"as modest, as the rest of his apparel. The young doctor timidly tries"
2411,FASHION.,"it on, and in his first walk meets the wealthy hypochondriac, his"
2412,FASHION.,"favorite patient, and the one who is trying to introduce him to"
2413,FASHION.,"practice, who seriously advises him, as a friend, not to wear that"
2414,FASHION.,"new-fangled thing,--if the poor hat had only been ugly, there would"
2415,FASHION.,"have been nothing bad in its _new-fangled_ quality,--as all his"
2416,FASHION.,respectable patients will leave him if he dresses so like a fool. The
2417,FASHION.,"young lawyer gets one, because he heard an old lady speak of ""those"
2418,FASHION.,"impudent-looking hats,"" and he is in hopes that impudence, which he"
2419,FASHION.,"understands is all-important in his profession, and which he is"
2420,FASHION.,"conscious of not possessing, may come with the hat. A lady goes out"
2421,FASHION.,"with her son, who is just old enough to have gained a coat, and is"
2422,FASHION.,"looking for his first hat. The mother has taste and judgment, and the"
2423,FASHION.,"youth has yet some unperverted affinity with graceful forms left, and"
2424,FASHION.,so they choose and buy one of these comfortable and elegant
2425,FASHION.,"chapeaux. Just before they reach home, they meet one of their best"
2426,FASHION.,"friends, a person whom the lady regards most kindly, and the young man"
2427,FASHION.,"admires and respects, and _he_ greets him with, ""Why, Tom! have _you_"
2428,FASHION.,"got one of those rowdy hats?"" And so the stiff, stove-pipe monstrosity"
2429,FASHION.,"keeps its place, and the only pleasant, sensible, graceful, becoming"
2430,FASHION.,"hat that the nineteenth century has known, is called all sorts of bad"
2431,FASHION.,"names, and quiet gentlemen are afraid to wear it."
2432,FASHION.,
2433,FASHION.,"Has it not been the fate of the shawl, too, the most simple and"
2434,FASHION.,"elegant wrapper, and comfortable withal, that a man can throw around"
2435,FASHION.,"him, to be scouted and flouted?"
2436,FASHION.,
2437,FASHION.,"Yes, Deformed! Come on next winter with a white surtout in your hand"
2438,FASHION.,that must fit so tightly that your victims can but just screw
2439,FASHION.,"themselves into it, with a stiff, square collar touching the ears, and"
2440,FASHION.,"seven capes, one over the other, ""small by degrees and beautifully"
2441,FASHION.,"less,"" and all respectable gentlemen will accept it, and virtuously"

2485,A GROWL.,"tailors' shops, and which, I am informed, does in fact arise from the"

2502,A GROWL.,are little accustomed to do; they must make some concession. We have
2503,A GROWL.,"done all we could do, and I will make one statement which will"
2504,A GROWL.,convince the world that we bachelors are not obstinate without good
2505,A GROWL.,reason. I confess (though it is not without some slight degree of
2506,A GROWL.,"shame that I own it), that I have, during the last week, consumed the"
2507,A GROWL.,"greater part of every day in ineffectual study, trying to perfect"
2508,A GROWL.,myself in the terminology of the science of Fashion. I have listened
2509,A GROWL.,"attentively, and have gathered into a retentive memory sundry"
2510,A GROWL.,technicalities; but in vain have I submitted these terms of a strange
2511,A GROWL.,dialect to the strictest etymological research. In vain have I
2512,A GROWL.,conversed upon this subject with the most intelligent dry-goods
2513,A GROWL.,"dealers. In learning the few idiomatic phrases they employ, I have"
2514,A GROWL.,experienced only the satisfaction which young students in Greek
2515,A GROWL.,"literature feel, when they have, with infinite labor, mastered the"
2516,A GROWL.,_alphabet_ of that rich and copious language.

2521,A GROWL.,"bonnets, float, as of yore, across our promenades, and on the"
2522,A GROWL.,shoulders of Earth's fairest daughters the variegated mantle be again
2523,A GROWL.,"displayed. The streets, now deserted by the fair, will ere long"

2526,A GROWL.,"condescendingly be extended to us, the smile of beauty beam on us, and"

2567,MY HERBARIUM.,
2568,MY HERBARIUM.,
2569,MY HERBARIUM.,"Poor, dry, musty flowers! Who would believe you ever danced in the"
2570,MY HERBARIUM.,"wind, drank in the evening dews, and spread sweet fragrance on the"
2571,MY HERBARIUM.,air? A touch now breaks your brittle leaves. Your odors are like attic
2572,MY HERBARIUM.,"herbs, or green tea, or mouldy books. Your forms are bent and"
2573,MY HERBARIUM.,flattened into every ugly and distorted shape. Your lovely colors are
2574,MY HERBARIUM.,"faded,--white changed to black, yellow to dirty white, gorgeous"
2575,MY HERBARIUM.,"scarlet to brick color, purple to muddy brown. Poor things! Who drew"
2576,MY HERBARIUM.,"you from your native woods and brooks, to press you flat, and dry your"
2577,MY HERBARIUM.,"moisture up, and paste you down helplessly upon your backs, such"
2578,MY HERBARIUM.,mocking shadows of your former grace and beauty?
2579,MY HERBARIUM.,
2580,MY HERBARIUM.,Ah! sorrowfully do I confess it! It was I. In my early years I
2581,MY HERBARIUM.,"searched the woods and meadows, scaled rocks, forded bogs, and"
2582,MY HERBARIUM.,"scrutinized each shady thicket, with murderous intent. I bore my"
2583,MY HERBARIUM.,"drooping victims home, and sacrificed them relentlessly to"
2584,MY HERBARIUM.,science. With my own hand I turned the screw that crushed out all that
2585,MY HERBARIUM.,was lovely and graceful and delicate about them. How I wearied myself
2586,MY HERBARIUM.,over that flower-press! How anxiously I watched over the stiff stalks
2587,MY HERBARIUM.,"and shrivelled leaves,--all that was left! How perseveringly I changed"
2588,MY HERBARIUM.,"and dried the papers, jammed my fingers between the heavy boards, and"
2589,MY HERBARIUM.,blistered my hands with that obstinate screw! And how cordially I
2590,MY HERBARIUM.,"hated it all! I liked the fun of gathering the flowers, the triumph of"
2591,MY HERBARIUM.,"finding new specimens, and the excitement of hazardous scrambles; but"
2592,MY HERBARIUM.,"as for the rest it was drudgery, which I went through only from a"
2593,MY HERBARIUM.,"stern sense of duty. Now, thanks to the busy little fingers that"
2594,MY HERBARIUM.,"passed over these leaves, I have a fund of amusement laid up for me;"
2595,MY HERBARIUM.,"for every page has its story, and each mutilated flower is the centre"
2596,MY HERBARIUM.,of a beautiful picture. Here the ludicrous and the pathetic are so
2597,MY HERBARIUM.,"exquisitely blended, that I laugh with a regretful feeling at my"
2598,MY HERBARIUM.,"heart, and sigh even when smiles are on my face. The first few pages"
2599,MY HERBARIUM.,"are light and joyous, full of a child's warm impulses and ready zeal,"
2600,MY HERBARIUM.,and enlivened here and there by some roguish caprice. That was the
2601,MY HERBARIUM.,"time when, in my simplicity, I loved dandelions and buttercups, and"
2602,MY HERBARIUM.,could see beauty even in the common white-weed of the fields. Ah!
2603,MY HERBARIUM.,"here they are, arranged in whimsical positions,--Clover and Sorrel,"
2604,MY HERBARIUM.,"Violets and Blue-eyed Grass, Peppergrass and Dock (O, how hard"
2605,MY HERBARIUM.,"that was to press!), Mouse-Ear and Yarrow, Shepherd's Purse,"
2606,MY HERBARIUM.,"Buttercups, and full-blown Dandelion, Succory, and Chickweed, and"
2607,MY HERBARIUM.,"Gill-run-over-the-ground,--with their homeliest names written in"
2608,MY HERBARIUM.,"sprawling characters, all down hill, beneath them. I did not aspire to"
2609,MY HERBARIUM.,botanical names in those days. I thought nothing was unfit for my new
2610,MY HERBARIUM.,"Herbarium. Such was my zeal, that I believe I should have filled it"
2611,MY HERBARIUM.,"entirely in a few days, if I had not been counselled to make a"
2612,MY HERBARIUM.,judicious selection. I had a faculty for bringing home plants
2613,MY HERBARIUM.,"impossible to press, and insisting upon making the experiment. I slept"
2614,MY HERBARIUM.,"for a week with my bed-post tilted up on a huge book, wherein reposed"
2615,MY HERBARIUM.,"a water-lily, obstinately refusing to lie flat. All kinds of woody"
2616,MY HERBARIUM.,"plants, too, were my delight, though they invariably came out of the"
2617,MY HERBARIUM.,"press as they went in, except that the leaves were in every variety of"
2618,MY HERBARIUM.,"unnatural position. I never grew weary, either, of gathering stately"
2619,MY HERBARIUM.,"and graceful green ferns, and finding them all ""cockled up,"" as the"
2620,MY HERBARIUM.,"phrase went, when I got home. I believe I made some experiments on a"
2621,MY HERBARIUM.,horsechestnut blossom once; but as it is not to be found in my
2622,MY HERBARIUM.,"Herbarium, I am inclined to think they were unsuccessful. How happy"
2623,MY HERBARIUM.,children are with any new possession! I thought there never was any
2624,MY HERBARIUM.,"thing quite equal to my new book. All the girls had them, with neat"
2625,MY HERBARIUM.,"marbled covers, and white paper within, and each one was determined to"
2626,MY HERBARIUM.,"make hers the best of the whole. When pasting day came, there was an"
2627,MY HERBARIUM.,intense excitement. We all daubed our little fingers to our heart's
2628,MY HERBARIUM.,"content, and our faces too, as to that.  I remember perfectly the"
2629,MY HERBARIUM.,"sensation of smiling, after the paste stiffened. We spattered our"
2630,MY HERBARIUM.,"desks, and pasted the wrong side of the flowers, and stuck the leaves"
2631,MY HERBARIUM.,"together, and got every thing a little one-sided, and, in short,"
2632,MY HERBARIUM.,"became so worried and heated and vexed, that we did not hunt for any"
2633,MY HERBARIUM.,more flowers for a long time after the first pasting day.
2634,MY HERBARIUM.,
2635,MY HERBARIUM.,In the mean while my ideas had undergone a change. I had become much
2636,MY HERBARIUM.,"more ambitious. A hew page brings flowers of a higher order, and,"
2637,MY HERBARIUM.,"beneath them, besides the common name, appears a sounding botanical"
2638,MY HERBARIUM.,"title; ay, still more, the class and order are written in full. Poor"
2639,MY HERBARIUM.,things! How many of your species must have been pulled to pieces by
2640,MY HERBARIUM.,"inexperienced hands, to ascertain the exact number of stamens, and"
2641,MY HERBARIUM.,"their relative positions! I feel, now, a tenderness for the shrinking,"
2642,MY HERBARIUM.,"delicate wild flowers, that makes me hesitate even to pick them from"
2643,MY HERBARIUM.,"their shady retreats; but _then_, such was my ardor for investigation,"
2644,MY HERBARIUM.,"the more I loved them, and the more beautiful they seemed, the more"
2645,MY HERBARIUM.,eagerly I tore them to fragments. Let the ingenious student analyze
2646,MY HERBARIUM.,"bits of brass wire, and reduce to its simple elements as much"
2647,MY HERBARIUM.,"gunpowder as he pleases, but I raise my voice against this wanton"
2648,MY HERBARIUM.,destruction of rare and beautiful flowers. No chemical process can
2649,MY HERBARIUM.,ever restore _them_.
2650,MY HERBARIUM.,
2651,MY HERBARIUM.,"As I glance over this new page, I see a merry troop of little girls,"
2652,MY HERBARIUM.,"crowding around their kind teacher, trying to restrain their"
2653,MY HERBARIUM.,"superabundant spirits, and restless activity, till they may give them"
2654,MY HERBARIUM.,"free scope in the woods. Passing up the street, they are joined by"
2655,MY HERBARIUM.,"fresh recruits, who come dancing out of the houses, with baskets, and"
2656,MY HERBARIUM.,"trowels, and tin boxes, and delightfully mysterious suppers packed"
2657,MY HERBARIUM.,"away nicely, to be eaten in the most romantic place that can be"
2658,MY HERBARIUM.,"found,--provided there is no danger of snakes, or ivy. Where they are"
2659,MY HERBARIUM.,"going I should find it impossible to say, until I have consulted the"
2660,MY HERBARIUM.,"new leaf just turned over. Here, side by side, are the wild Columbine"
2661,MY HERBARIUM.,"and the cheerful little Bethlehem Star. They grew, I remember, upon"
2662,MY HERBARIUM.,"Powder-House Hill, so named from the massive granite building upon its"
2663,MY HERBARIUM.,"summit, which we never dared to go near, for fear of an explosion. The"
2664,MY HERBARIUM.,"hill was rough, rocky, barren, and in some places quite steep. In the"
2665,MY HERBARIUM.,"clefts of the rocks, generally far above our reach, the bright red"
2666,MY HERBARIUM.,"columbines stood in groups, drooping their graceful heads. Some of the"
2667,MY HERBARIUM.,rocks were worn to a perfect polish by the feet of daring sliders. It
2668,MY HERBARIUM.,was a dangerous pastime even to the most experienced. A loss of
2669,MY HERBARIUM.,"balance, a slight deviation from the beaten track, a trip in a hollow,"
2670,MY HERBARIUM.,"or a momentary entanglement in your dress,--and you are lost! I"
2671,MY HERBARIUM.,"declined joining in the diversion ever after the first attempt, which"
2672,MY HERBARIUM.,was nothing but a headlong plunge from top to bottom. But though I
2673,MY HERBARIUM.,"heroically stood aloof while the girls were enjoying the sport, and"
2674,MY HERBARIUM.,"making the air ring with their laughter, I was sure, afterwards, to"
2675,MY HERBARIUM.,"come upon the slippery places unintentionally, and take a slide"
2676,MY HERBARIUM.,"whether I would or not. I had, I remember, a most unfortunate"
2677,MY HERBARIUM.,"propensity for climbing and scrambling, choosing the worst paths, and"
2678,MY HERBARIUM.,daring the others to follow my lead on precarious footholds. It was
2679,MY HERBARIUM.,"unfortunate, because I seldom came forth from these trials unscathed."
2680,MY HERBARIUM.,"I was always tearing my dresses in clambering over fences, or bumping"
2681,MY HERBARIUM.,my head in creeping under. Where others cleared brooks with a light
2682,MY HERBARIUM.,"spring, I landed in the middle. I was sure to pick out spongy, oozy,"
2683,MY HERBARIUM.,"slippery grass to stand upon, in marshy land, or was yet more likely"
2684,MY HERBARIUM.,to slump through over shoes in black mud. Banks always caved in
2685,MY HERBARIUM.,"beneath my feet, unexpectedly. Brambles seemed to enter into a"
2686,MY HERBARIUM.,"conspiracy to lay violent hands on me, and hidden boughs lay in wait"
2687,MY HERBARIUM.,"to trip me up. Moss and bark scaled off the trunks of fallen trees,"
2688,MY HERBARIUM.,"bearing me with it when I was least on my guard, or the trunks"
2689,MY HERBARIUM.,"themselves, solid enough to all appearance, crushed to powder beneath"
2690,MY HERBARIUM.,my unwary tread. Even the stone walls deserted me.  I made use of one
2691,MY HERBARIUM.,"as a bridge, one day, to reach a golden cowslip that grew temptingly"
2692,MY HERBARIUM.,"in a swamp; but a treacherous stone rolled off with me, and a perfect"
2693,MY HERBARIUM.,"avalanche of huge rocks followed, splashing the muddy water all over"
2694,MY HERBARIUM.,"me as I sat, helplessly, buoyed up by the tall grass. I regret to say,"
2695,MY HERBARIUM.,I forgot the cowslip.

2768,COWS.,I admire cows in their proper places. They are undoubtedly useful
2769,COWS.,"animals; some may think them handsome and graceful: this is, as yet,"
2770,COWS.,an unsettled question. They certainly figure pretty extensively in all
2771,COWS.,"sketches of rural scenery, and may, therefore, be considered as"
2772,COWS.,picturesque objects; but I think that on canvas they take to
2773,COWS.,themselves beauties which they do not possess in actual life. I do not
2774,COWS.,"object to see them at a distance, quietly grazing in a meadow by the"
2775,COWS.,"brink of a winding stream, and all that sort of thing, provided the"
2776,COWS.,"distance is very great, and a strong fence intervenes. For I would"
2777,COWS.,"have you know, that I am a delicate young lady of nervous temperament"
2778,COWS.,"and keen sensibilities, and have a mortal dread of cows. I am not used"
2779,COWS.,"to the customs of country life, which place this animal on a level"
2780,COWS.,"with domestic pets, and when my brother asked me to pat the side of"
2781,COWS.,"one of these great, coarse brutes, I screamed at the mere idea. For I"
2782,COWS.,"should be extremely unwilling to provoke one of them, because I have"
2783,COWS.,"been told that, when heated with passion, as these beasts often are,"
2784,COWS.,it sometimes happens that the powder-horns on top of their heads
2785,COWS.,"explode, and spread ruin and desolation around.  People here bestow a"
2786,COWS.,"vast deal too much consideration on these unpleasant animals, for they"
2787,COWS.,"are often seen--that is, those of them that are troubled with weak"
2788,COWS.,"eyes--walking along the streets with boards over their faces, as a"
2789,COWS.,protection from the rays of the sun. I don't believe that is the real
2790,COWS.,"reason of the thing, though my brother assures me that it is. I think,"
2791,COWS.,"myself, that it is intended as a keen satire upon those young ladies"
2792,COWS.,who wear veils in the streets; but I never will yield my point. I
2793,COWS.,"_will_ wear my veil, so long as I have a complexion worth protecting,"
2794,COWS.,and so long as there are gentlemen worth cutting. The Brighton Bridge
2795,COWS.,"Battery is a delightful promenade on a warm summer's day, it is _so_"
2796,COWS.,"shady; but it is closed, I may say, every Wednesday and Thursday, to"
2797,COWS.,"accommodate these detestable pets of the public. It seems, as my"
2798,COWS.,"brother informs me, that the drovers, from humane considerations, are"
2799,COWS.,"in the habit of driving their cattle over to Brighton, (when the"
2800,COWS.,"weather is pleasant,) and back again on the next day, in order that"
2801,COWS.,their health may be improved by the sea-air which blows up Charles
2802,COWS.,"River. Now I think that when the cow takes precedence of the lady, and"
2803,COWS.,"usurps, to the utter exclusion of the latter, the most delightful"
2804,COWS.,"promenade in Cambridge, it is time the city authorities should look to"
2805,COWS.,"it; and so I told my brother. He considered for a moment, and then"
2806,COWS.,"advised me not to bear it any longer, but to go upon Brighton Bridge,"
2807,COWS.,"_in spite_ of the cows, and assert my independence. I followed his"
2808,COWS.,"advice, as I always do, and, on one fine afternoon, took advantage of"
2809,COWS.,the pleasant weather to indulge in a solitary walk in that
2810,COWS.,"direction. As I was sauntering along on the wooden sidewalk, gazing at"
2811,COWS.,the noble ships which lay moored by their gaff-topsails to the
2812,COWS.,"abutments of the bridge, and viewing the honest sailors as they"
2813,COWS.,promenaded up and down the string-ladders at the command of their
2814,COWS.,"captains, my fears were aroused by a distant commotion. I hastily"
2815,COWS.,turned and looked over the railing into the street. A whole drove of
2816,COWS.,"infuriated cows, urged on by two fiendish boys and a savage dog, was"
2817,COWS.,rapidly approaching me from the Cambridge side. What should I do? I
2818,COWS.,"was too much fatigued to run, and I had never learned to swim. My"
2819,COWS.,plans were hastily formed. Flinging my red silk visite and sky-blue
2820,COWS.,"parasolette into the water, lest the gay colors should still more"
2821,COWS.,"enrage the wild animals, I jumped over the outside railing towards the"
2822,COWS.,"river, and hung by one arm over the angry flood during a moment of"
2823,COWS.,"speechless agony!  On they came, with lightning speed, in a whirlwind"
2824,COWS.,"of dust. A rapid succession of earthquakes--bellowings--groans,--and"
2825,COWS.,"all was over. I was safe. On inspection of the footmarks, I felt quite"
2826,COWS.,"sure that some of them must have approached within ten yards of me,"
2827,COWS.,and only two railings had intervened between me and their fury.
2828,COWS.,
2829,COWS.,An honest tar from one of the men-of-war employed in unloading coal at
2830,COWS.,"Willard's Wharf took the captain's gig, and made for my parasol and"
2831,COWS.,"visite as they floated away, and returned them with the very"
2832,COWS.,"unintelligible remark, that I'd ""better not clear the wreck next time"
2833,COWS.,"unless it blew more of a breeze."""

3029,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,THE FOURTH OF JULY.
3030,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3031,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3032,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,It was the anniversary of our Glorious Fourth. The evil genius who
3033,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,specially presides over the destinies of unoffending college boys put
3034,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,it into the heads of five of us to celebrate the day by an excursion
3035,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"by water to Nahant Beach. The morning was delightful,--the cool summer"
3036,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"air just freshening into a steady and favoring breeze, the sun"
3037,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"tempered in his ferocity by an occasional cloud above us, the sea calm"
3038,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"and pleasant--and all that sort of thing, you know--just what you want"
3039,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"on such occasions,--and we set sail from Braman's, resolved to have ""a"
3040,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"jolly good time."" I can't describe our passage down. It was altogether"
3041,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"too full of fun to be written on one sheet. Suffice it to say, we"
3042,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"laughed, and sang, and joked, and ate, and drank ('t was when we were"
3043,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"young), and so on, all the way, and in fact I felt rather disappointed"
3044,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,at arriving so soon as we did at our destined port. Here new pleasures
3045,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"awaited us, in the shape of acquaintances unexpected and unexpecting,"
3046,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"rides on the beach, bowling, and loafing in general,--much too rich to"
3047,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"be described here and now. But there is an end to all sport, and ours"
3048,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,came quite too soon. The shadows had begun to lengthen considerably
3049,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"before we thought of starting on our return, and certain ominous"
3050,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"indications in the heavens above us warned us, that, as our passage"
3051,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"homewards was not by land, further delay was unadvisable."
3052,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3053,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Dolefully we set our sail, and made for Boston Harbor. We began to"
3054,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"feel the reaction which always follows a season of extreme joviality,"
3055,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"and our spirits were down. Our chief wit, Tom B----, who had before"
3056,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"kept us in a perpetual roar all the way, sat moody and desponding, and"
3057,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,answered gruffly every question put to him; speaking only when spoken
3058,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"to, and then in monosyllables rarely used in polite circles. Our"
3059,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"_other_ joker, second only to Tom, the above named, having amused us"
3060,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,during the whole day by long yarns spun out from a varied experience
3061,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"and a rich imagination, betook himself to slumber, and tried to dream"
3062,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,that he was safe home again. The rest of us performed our duties about
3063,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"the boat in gloomy silence, looking occasionally with some anxiety at"
3064,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"the clouds gathering slowly over our heads, but keeping our opinions"
3065,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"within our own breasts. I had no apprehension of danger, for nothing"
3066,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"indicated a gale; in fact, the breeze was gradually deserting us. All"
3067,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"that was to be feared was a calm, steady rain, which, visiting us at a"
3068,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"distance of several miles from home, and late at night, promised any"
3069,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,thing but an agreeable conclusion to our day's excursion. At last it
3070,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"came. First, a heavy drop, then a few more, and then a regular,"
3071,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"straight, old-fashioned pour."
3072,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3073,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Our sail hung motionless, and we seemed to stand still and take"
3074,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,it. Our companions were soon roused from their abstraction by the very
3075,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"unpleasant circumstances, and we hastily took counsel together."
3076,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3077,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"""Unship the mast,"" says Tom, ""and over with your oars."""
3078,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3079,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"We obeyed our captain sulkily, and soon were moving on again. We"
3080,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"pulled away for an hour or so, drenched with the rain, which seemed to"
3081,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"come down faster than ever, and were about as miserable and down-cast"
3082,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,a pack of wretches as ever lived; for there is nothing like a good
3083,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,ducking (to use the common expression) to take the life and spirit out
3084,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"of a man, not to mention the other discomforts that attended our"
3085,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,situation.
3086,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3087,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Silently we rowed, and not a sound was heard above the plashing of the"
3088,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"rain upon the surface of the sea, and the regular stroke of the oars."
3089,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3090,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"""It's very strange that we don't reach old Point Shirley,"" says Tom,"
3091,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,who had been on the look out for this landmark during the last
3092,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,half-hour.
3093,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3094,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"""Very strange,"" said we, and pulled away as before."
3095,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3096,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Thus passed another half-hour in silent, ceaseless occupation, when,"
3097,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"from the mere force of habit, I dipped my hand over the boat's"
3098,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"gunwale, with the hope of cooling my blistered palm in the salt water."
3099,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Judge of my surprise, when I found my hand immersed in _thick black"
3100,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,mud_.
3101,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3102,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"""By Jove, fellows,"" cried I, ""we're floored!"""
3103,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3104,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,There was no mistaking the fact; we were aground. At that instant the
3105,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"moon burst out from between the drifting clouds, and, as if in"
3106,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"derision, threw a streak of light over our melancholy position. There"
3107,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"we were, high and dry on a bank of mud, a scooped furrow on each side"
3108,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"of us attesting the frantic efforts of our oarsmen to get a headway,"
3109,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"and a long wake, ten feet in extent, marking our distance from the sea"
3110,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,behind us. Such was our position as the moon revealed it to us. We
3111,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,looked dolefully in one another's faces for three minutes; then a grim
3112,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"smile gradually stole over Tom's expressive countenance, as he slowly"
3113,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"ejaculated, ""Point Shirley it is!"" when the ludicrous side of the"
3114,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"matter seemed to occur to each of us simultaneously, and we indulged"
3115,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"ourselves with a roar of laughter,--the first since we had left"
3116,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,Nahant.
3117,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3118,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"Of course, nothing could be done under the circumstances; but we must"
3119,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,wait patiently for the rising of the tide to float us off. So we sat
3120,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"there in our wet garments until the dead of night, when our boat"
3121,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"gradually lifted herself off and we started again, and finally arrived"
3122,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,at Braman's early in the morning.
3123,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,
3124,THE FOURTH OF JULY.,"The moral of this tale may be summed up in a single word,--TEMPERANCE."
