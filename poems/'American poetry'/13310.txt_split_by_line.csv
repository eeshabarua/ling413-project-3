420,THRENODIA,"Those calm eyes, nevermore?"
421,THRENODIA,"Those deep, dark eyes so warm and bright,"
422,THRENODIA,Wherein the fortunes of the man
423,THRENODIA,"Lay slumbering in prophetic light,"
424,THRENODIA,In characters a child might scan?
425,THRENODIA,"So bright, and gone forth utterly!"
426,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
427,THRENODIA,
428,THRENODIA,The stars of those two gentle eyes     10
429,THRENODIA,Will shine no more on earth;
430,THRENODIA,"Quenched are the hopes that had their birth,"
431,THRENODIA,"As we watched them slowly rise,"
432,THRENODIA,Stars of a mother's fate;
433,THRENODIA,"And she would read them o'er and o'er,"
434,THRENODIA,"Pondering, as she sate,"
435,THRENODIA,"Over their dear astrology,"
436,THRENODIA,"Which she had conned and conned before,"
437,THRENODIA,Deeming she needs must read aright     19
438,THRENODIA,What was writ so passing bright.
439,THRENODIA,"And yet, alas! she knew not why."
440,THRENODIA,"Her voice would falter in its song,"
441,THRENODIA,"And tears would slide from out her eye,"
442,THRENODIA,"Silent, as they were doing wrong."
443,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
444,THRENODIA,
445,THRENODIA,The tongue that scarce had learned to claim
446,THRENODIA,An entrance to a mother's heart
447,THRENODIA,"By that dear talisman, a mother's name,"
448,THRENODIA,Sleeps all forgetful of its art!
449,THRENODIA,I loved to see the infant soul     30
450,THRENODIA,(How mighty in the weakness
451,THRENODIA,Of its untutored meekness!)
452,THRENODIA,"Peep timidly from out its nest,"
453,THRENODIA,"His lips, the while,"
454,THRENODIA,"Fluttering with half-fledged words,"
455,THRENODIA,Or hushing to a smile
456,THRENODIA,"That more than words expressed,"
457,THRENODIA,When his glad mother on him stole
458,THRENODIA,And snatched him to her breast!
459,THRENODIA,"Oh, thoughts were brooding in those eyes,     40"
460,THRENODIA,That would have soared like strong-winged birds
461,THRENODIA,"Far, far into the skies,"
462,THRENODIA,"Gladding the earth with song,"
463,THRENODIA,"And gushing harmonies,"
464,THRENODIA,Had he but tarried with us long!
465,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
466,THRENODIA,
467,THRENODIA,"How peacefully they rest,"
468,THRENODIA,Crossfolded there
469,THRENODIA,"Upon his little breast,"
470,THRENODIA,"Those small, white hands that ne'er were still before,     50"
471,THRENODIA,"But ever sported with his mother's hair,"
472,THRENODIA,Or the plain cross that on her breast she wore!
473,THRENODIA,Her heart no more will beat
474,THRENODIA,"To feel the touch of that soft palm,"
475,THRENODIA,That ever seemed a new surprise
476,THRENODIA,Sending glad thoughts up to her eyes
477,THRENODIA,"To bless him with their holy calm,--"
478,THRENODIA,Sweet thoughts! they made her eyes as sweet.
479,THRENODIA,How quiet are the hands
480,THRENODIA,That wove those pleasant bands!
481,THRENODIA,But that they do not rise and sink      61
482,THRENODIA,"With his calm breathing, I should think"
483,THRENODIA,That he were dropped asleep.
484,THRENODIA,"Alas! too deep, too deep"
485,THRENODIA,Is this his slumber!
486,THRENODIA,Time scarce can number
487,THRENODIA,The years ere he shall wake again.
488,THRENODIA,"Oh, may we see his eyelids open then!"
489,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
490,THRENODIA,
491,THRENODIA,"As the airy gossamere,      70"
492,THRENODIA,"Floating in the sunlight clear,"
493,THRENODIA,"Where'er it toucheth clingeth tightly,"
494,THRENODIA,"Bound glossy leal or stump unsightly,"
495,THRENODIA,So from his spirit wandered out
496,THRENODIA,"Tendrils spreading all about,"
497,THRENODIA,Knitting all things to its thrall
498,THRENODIA,With a perfect love of all:
499,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
500,THRENODIA,
501,THRENODIA,He did but float a little way
502,THRENODIA,"Adown the stream of time,      80"
503,THRENODIA,"With dreamy eyes watching the ripples play,"
504,THRENODIA,Or hearkening their fairy chime;
505,THRENODIA,His slender sail
506,THRENODIA,Ne'er felt the gale;
507,THRENODIA,"He did but float a little way,"
508,THRENODIA,"And, putting to the shore"
509,THRENODIA,"While yet 't was early day,"
510,THRENODIA,"Went calmly on his way,"
511,THRENODIA,To dwell with us no more!
512,THRENODIA,"No jarring did he feel,      90"
513,THRENODIA,No grating on his shallop's keel;
514,THRENODIA,A strip of silver sand
515,THRENODIA,Mingled the waters with the land
516,THRENODIA,Where he was seen no more:
517,THRENODIA,Oh stern word--Nevermore!
518,THRENODIA,
519,THRENODIA,Full short his journey was; no dust
520,THRENODIA,Of earth unto his sandals clave;
521,THRENODIA,"The weary weight that old men must,"
522,THRENODIA,He bore not to the grave.
523,THRENODIA,He seemed a cherub who had lost his way      100
524,THRENODIA,"And wandered hither, so his stay"
525,THRENODIA,"With us was short, and 't was most meet"
526,THRENODIA,"That he should be no delver in earth's clod,"
527,THRENODIA,Nor need to pause and cleanse his feet
528,THRENODIA,To stand before his God:
529,THRENODIA,Oh blest word--Evermore!

533,THE SIRENS,THE SIRENS
534,THE SIRENS,
535,THE SIRENS,"The sea is lonely, the sea is dreary,"
536,THE SIRENS,The sea is restless and uneasy;
537,THE SIRENS,"Thou seekest quiet, thou art weary,"
538,THE SIRENS,Wandering thou knowest not whither;--
539,THE SIRENS,"Our little isle is green and breezy,"
540,THE SIRENS,"Come and rest thee! Oh come hither,"
541,THE SIRENS,"Come to this peaceful home of ours,"
542,THE SIRENS,Where evermore
543,THE SIRENS,The low west-wind creeps panting up the shore      9
544,THE SIRENS,To be at rest among the flowers;
545,THE SIRENS,"Full of rest, the green moss lifts,"
546,THE SIRENS,As the dark waves of the sea
547,THE SIRENS,"Draw in and out of rocky rifts,"
548,THE SIRENS,Calling solemnly to thee
549,THE SIRENS,"With voices deep and hollow,--"
550,THE SIRENS,'To the shore
551,THE SIRENS,"Follow! Oh, follow!"
552,THE SIRENS,To be at rest forevermore!
553,THE SIRENS,Forevermore!'
554,THE SIRENS,
555,THE SIRENS,Look how the gray old Ocean      20
556,THE SIRENS,"From the depth of his heart rejoices,"
557,THE SIRENS,"Heaving with a gentle motion,"
558,THE SIRENS,When he hears our restful voices;
559,THE SIRENS,"List how he sings in an undertone,"
560,THE SIRENS,Chiming with our melody;
561,THE SIRENS,And all sweet sounds of earth and air
562,THE SIRENS,"Melt into one low voice alone,"
563,THE SIRENS,"That murmurs over the weary sea,"
564,THE SIRENS,"And seems to sing from everywhere,--"
565,THE SIRENS,"'Here mayst thou harbor peacefully,     30"
566,THE SIRENS,Here mayst thou rest from the aching oar;
567,THE SIRENS,"Turn thy curved prow ashore,"
568,THE SIRENS,And in our green isle rest forevermore!
569,THE SIRENS,Forevermore!'
570,THE SIRENS,"And Echo half wakes in the wooded hill,"
571,THE SIRENS,"And, to her heart so calm and deep,"
572,THE SIRENS,"Murmurs over in her sleep,"
573,THE SIRENS,"Doubtfully pausing and murmuring still,"
574,THE SIRENS,'Evermore!'
575,THE SIRENS,"Thus, on Life's weary sea,      40"
576,THE SIRENS,Heareth the marinere
577,THE SIRENS,"Voices sweet, from far and near,"
578,THE SIRENS,"Ever singing low and clear,"
579,THE SIRENS,Ever singing longingly.
580,THE SIRENS,
581,THE SIRENS,"Is it not better here to be,"
582,THE SIRENS,Than to be toiling late and soon?
583,THE SIRENS,In the dreary night to see
584,THE SIRENS,Nothing but the blood-red moon
585,THE SIRENS,Go up and down into the sea;
586,THE SIRENS,"Or, in the loneliness of day,      50"
587,THE SIRENS,To see the still seals only
588,THE SIRENS,"Solemnly lift their faces gray,"
589,THE SIRENS,Making it yet more lonely?
590,THE SIRENS,Is it not better than to hear
591,THE SIRENS,Only the sliding of the wave
592,THE SIRENS,"Beneath the plank, and feel so near"
593,THE SIRENS,"A cold and lonely grave,"
594,THE SIRENS,"A restless grave, where thou shalt lie"
595,THE SIRENS,Even in death unquietly?
596,THE SIRENS,"Look down beneath thy wave-worn bark,      60"
597,THE SIRENS,Lean over the side and see
598,THE SIRENS,The leaden eye of the sidelong shark
599,THE SIRENS,"Upturnèd patiently,"
600,THE SIRENS,Ever waiting there for thee:
601,THE SIRENS,"Look down and see those shapeless forms,"
602,THE SIRENS,Which ever keep their dreamless sleep
603,THE SIRENS,"Far down within the gloomy deep,"
604,THE SIRENS,"And only stir themselves in storms,"
605,THE SIRENS,"Rising like islands from beneath,"
606,THE SIRENS,"And snorting through the angry spray,      70"
607,THE SIRENS,As the frail vessel perisheth
608,THE SIRENS,In the whirls of their unwieldy play;
609,THE SIRENS,Look down! Look down!
610,THE SIRENS,"Upon the seaweed, slimy and dark,"
611,THE SIRENS,"That waves its arms so lank and brown,"
612,THE SIRENS,Beckoning for thee!
613,THE SIRENS,Look down beneath thy wave-worn bark
614,THE SIRENS,Into the cold depth of the sea!
615,THE SIRENS,Look down! Look down!
616,THE SIRENS,"Thus, on Life's lonely sea,      80"
617,THE SIRENS,Heareth the marinere
618,THE SIRENS,"Voices sad, from far and near,"
619,THE SIRENS,"Ever singing full of fear,"
620,THE SIRENS,Ever singing drearfully.
621,THE SIRENS,
622,THE SIRENS,Here all is pleasant as a dream;
623,THE SIRENS,"The wind scarce shaketh down the dew,"
624,THE SIRENS,The green grass floweth like a stream
625,THE SIRENS,Into the ocean's blue;
626,THE SIRENS,"Listen! Oh, listen!"
627,THE SIRENS,"Here is a gush of many streams,"
628,THE SIRENS,"A song of many birds,      91"
629,THE SIRENS,And every wish and longing seems
630,THE SIRENS,"Lulled to a numbered flow of words,--"
631,THE SIRENS,"Listen! Oh, listen!"
632,THE SIRENS,Here ever hum the golden bees
633,THE SIRENS,"Underneath full-blossomed trees,"
634,THE SIRENS,At once with glowing fruit and flowers crowned;--
635,THE SIRENS,"So smooth the sand, the yellow sand,"
636,THE SIRENS,That thy keel will not grate as it touches the land;
637,THE SIRENS,"All around with a slumberous sound,     100"
638,THE SIRENS,"The singing waves slide up the strand,"
639,THE SIRENS,"And there, where the smooth, wet pebbles be,"
640,THE SIRENS,"The waters gurgle longingly,"
641,THE SIRENS,"As If they fain would seek the shore,"
642,THE SIRENS,"To be at rest from the ceaseless roar,"
643,THE SIRENS,"To be at rest forevermore,--"
644,THE SIRENS,Forevermore.
645,THE SIRENS,"Thus, on Life's gloomy sea,"
646,THE SIRENS,Heareth the marinere
647,THE SIRENS,"Voices sweet, from far and near,     110"
648,THE SIRENS,"Ever singing in his ear,"
649,THE SIRENS,'Here is rest and peace for thee!'

651,THE SIRENS,
652,THE SIRENS,
653,IRENÉ,IRENÉ
654,IRENÉ,
655,IRENÉ,"Hers is a spirit deep, and crystal-clear;"
656,IRENÉ,"Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies,"
657,IRENÉ,"Free without boldness, meek without a fear,"
658,IRENÉ,Quicker to look than speak its sympathies;
659,IRENÉ,Far down into her large and patient eyes
660,IRENÉ,"I gaze, deep-drinking of the infinite,"
661,IRENÉ,"As, in the mid-watch of a clear, still night,"
662,IRENÉ,I look into the fathomless blue skies.
663,IRENÉ,
664,IRENÉ,"So circled lives she with Love's holy light,"
665,IRENÉ,That from the shade of self she walketh free;     10
666,IRENÉ,The garden of her soul still keepeth she
667,IRENÉ,An Eden where the snake did never enter;
668,IRENÉ,"She hath a natural, wise sincerity,"
669,IRENÉ,"A simple truthfulness, and these have lent her"
670,IRENÉ,A dignity as moveless as the centre;
671,IRENÉ,So that no influence of our earth can stir
672,IRENÉ,"Her steadfast courage, nor can take away"
673,IRENÉ,"The holy peacefulness, which night and day,"
674,IRENÉ,Unto her queenly soul doth minister.
675,IRENÉ,
676,IRENÉ,Most gentle is she; her large charity     20
677,IRENÉ,"(An all unwitting, childlike gift in her)"
678,IRENÉ,Not freer is to give than meek to bear;
679,IRENÉ,"And, though herself not unacquaint with care,"
680,IRENÉ,"Hath in her heart wide room for all that be,--"
681,IRENÉ,"Her heart that hath no secrets of its own,"
682,IRENÉ,But open is as eglantine full blown.
683,IRENÉ,"Cloudless forever is her brow serene,"
684,IRENÉ,"Speaking calm hope and trust within her, whence"
685,IRENÉ,"Welleth a noiseless spring of patience,"
686,IRENÉ,"That keepeth all her life so fresh, so green     30"
687,IRENÉ,"And full of holiness, that every look,"
688,IRENÉ,"The greatness of her woman's soul revealing,"
689,IRENÉ,"Unto me bringeth blessing, and a feeling"
690,IRENÉ,As when I read in God's own holy book.
691,IRENÉ,
692,IRENÉ,A graciousness in giving that doth make
693,IRENÉ,"The small'st gift greatest, and a sense most meek"
694,IRENÉ,"Of worthiness, that doth not fear to take"
695,IRENÉ,"From others, but which always fears to speak"
696,IRENÉ,"Its thanks in utterance, for the giver's sake;--"
697,IRENÉ,"The deep religion of a thankful heart,      40"
698,IRENÉ,Which rests instinctively in Heaven's clear law
699,IRENÉ,"With a full peace, that never can depart"
700,IRENÉ,From its own steadfastness;--a holy awe
701,IRENÉ,"For holy things,--not those which men call holy,"
702,IRENÉ,But such as are revealèd to the eyes
703,IRENÉ,Of a true woman's soul bent down and lowly
704,IRENÉ,Before the face of daily mysteries;--
705,IRENÉ,"A love that blossoms soon, but ripens slowly"
706,IRENÉ,"To the full goldenness of fruitful prime,"
707,IRENÉ,Enduring with a firmness that defies      50
708,IRENÉ,"All shallow tricks of circumstance and time,"
709,IRENÉ,"By a sure insight knowing where to cling,"
710,IRENÉ,And where it clingeth never withering;--
711,IRENÉ,"These are Irené's dowry, which no fate"
712,IRENÉ,"Can shake from their serene, deep-builded state."
713,IRENÉ,
714,IRENÉ,"In-seeing sympathy is hers, which chasteneth"
715,IRENÉ,"No less than loveth, scorning to be bound"
716,IRENÉ,"With fear of blame, and yet which ever hasteneth"
717,IRENÉ,"To pour the balm of kind looks on the wound,"
718,IRENÉ,"If they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes,      60"
719,IRENÉ,Giving itself a pang for others' sakes;
720,IRENÉ,"No want of faith, that chills with sidelong eye,"
721,IRENÉ,"Hath she; no jealousy, no Levite pride"
722,IRENÉ,That passeth by upon the other side;
723,IRENÉ,For in her soul there never dwelt a lie.
724,IRENÉ,Right from the hand of God her spirit came
725,IRENÉ,"Unstained, and she hath ne'er forgotten whence"
726,IRENÉ,"It came, nor wandered far from thence,"
727,IRENÉ,"But laboreth to keep her still the same,"
728,IRENÉ,"Near to her place of birth, that she may not      70"
729,IRENÉ,Soil her white raiment with an earthly spot.
730,IRENÉ,
731,IRENÉ,Yet sets she not her soul so steadily
732,IRENÉ,"Above, that she forgets her ties to earth,"
733,IRENÉ,But her whole thought would almost seem to be
734,IRENÉ,How to make glad one lowly human hearth;
735,IRENÉ,For with a gentle courage she doth strive
736,IRENÉ,In thought and word and feeling so to live
737,IRENÉ,As to make earth next heaven; and her heart
738,IRENÉ,"Herein doth show its most exceeding worth,"
739,IRENÉ,"That, bearing in our frailty her just part,       80"
740,IRENÉ,"She hath not shrunk from evils of this life,"
741,IRENÉ,"But hath gone calmly forth into the strife,"
742,IRENÉ,And all its sins and sorrows hath withstood
743,IRENÉ,With lofty strength of patient womanhood:
744,IRENÉ,"For this I love her great soul more than all,"
745,IRENÉ,"That, being bound, like us, with earthly thrall,"
746,IRENÉ,"She walks so bright and heaven-like therein,--"
747,IRENÉ,"Too wise, too meek, too womanly, to sin."
748,IRENÉ,
749,IRENÉ,Like a lone star through riven storm-clouds seen
750,IRENÉ,"By sailors, tempest-tost upon the sea,                              90"
751,IRENÉ,"Telling of rest and peaceful heavens nigh,"
752,IRENÉ,"Unto my soul her star-like soul hath been,"
753,IRENÉ,Her sight as full of hope and calm to me;--
754,IRENÉ,For she unto herself hath builded high
755,IRENÉ,"A home serene, wherein to lay her head,"
756,IRENÉ,"Earth's noblest thing, a Woman perfected."

836,THE BEGGAR,"That the world's blasts may round me blow,"
837,THE BEGGAR,"And I yield gently to and fro,"
838,THE BEGGAR,While my stout-hearted trunk below
839,THE BEGGAR,And firm-set roots unshaken be.
840,THE BEGGAR,
841,THE BEGGAR,"Some of thy stern, unyielding might,"
842,THE BEGGAR,Enduring still through day and night
843,THE BEGGAR,"Rude tempest-shock and withering blight,"
844,THE BEGGAR,That I may keep at bay
845,THE BEGGAR,The changeful April sky of chance
846,THE BEGGAR,"And the strong tide of circumstance,--"
847,THE BEGGAR,"Give me, old granite gray."
848,THE BEGGAR,
849,THE BEGGAR,"Some of thy pensiveness serene,"
850,THE BEGGAR,"Some of thy never-dying green,"
851,THE BEGGAR,"Put in this scrip of mine,"
852,THE BEGGAR,"That griefs may fall like snowflakes light,"
853,THE BEGGAR,"And deck me in a robe of white,"
854,THE BEGGAR,"Ready to be an angel bright,"
855,THE BEGGAR,O sweetly mournful pine.
856,THE BEGGAR,
857,THE BEGGAR,"A little of thy merriment,"
858,THE BEGGAR,"Of thy sparkling, light content,"
859,THE BEGGAR,"Give me, my cheerful brook,"
860,THE BEGGAR,That I may still be full of glee
861,THE BEGGAR,"And gladsomeness, where'er I be,"
862,THE BEGGAR,Though fickle fate hath prisoned me
863,THE BEGGAR,In some neglected nook.
864,THE BEGGAR,
865,THE BEGGAR,Ye have been very kind and good
866,THE BEGGAR,"To me, since I've been in the wood;"
867,THE BEGGAR,Ye have gone nigh to fill my heart;
868,THE BEGGAR,"But good-by, kind friends, every one,"
869,THE BEGGAR,I've far to go ere set of sun;
870,THE BEGGAR,"Of all good things I would have part,"
871,THE BEGGAR,"The day was high ere I could start,"
872,THE BEGGAR,And so my journey's scarce begun.
873,THE BEGGAR,
874,THE BEGGAR,Heaven help me! how could I forget
875,THE BEGGAR,"To beg of thee, dear violet!"
876,THE BEGGAR,"Some of thy modesty,"
877,THE BEGGAR,"That blossoms here as well, unseen,"
878,THE BEGGAR,"As if before the world thou'dst been,"
879,THE BEGGAR,"Oh, give, to strengthen me."

883,MY LOVE,MY LOVE
884,MY LOVE,
885,MY LOVE,Not as all other women are
886,MY LOVE,Is she that to my soul is dear;
887,MY LOVE,"Her glorious fancies come from far,"
888,MY LOVE,"Beneath the silver evening-star,"
889,MY LOVE,And yet her heart is ever near.
890,MY LOVE,
891,MY LOVE,"Great feelings hath she of her own,"
892,MY LOVE,Which lesser souls may never know;
893,MY LOVE,"God giveth them to her alone,"
894,MY LOVE,And sweet they are as any tone
895,MY LOVE,Wherewith the wind may choose to blow.
896,MY LOVE,
897,MY LOVE,Yet in herself she dwelleth not.
898,MY LOVE,Although no home were half so fair;
899,MY LOVE,"No simplest duty is forgot,"
900,MY LOVE,Life hath no dim and lowly spot
901,MY LOVE,That doth not in her sunshine share.
902,MY LOVE,
903,MY LOVE,"She doeth little kindnesses,"
904,MY LOVE,"Which most leave undone, or despise:"
905,MY LOVE,"For naught that sets one heart at ease,"
906,MY LOVE,"And giveth happiness or peace,"
907,MY LOVE,Is low-esteemèd in her eyes.
908,MY LOVE,
909,MY LOVE,"She hath no scorn of common things,"
910,MY LOVE,"And, though she seem of other birth,"
911,MY LOVE,"Round us her heart intwines and clings,"
912,MY LOVE,And patiently she folds her wings
913,MY LOVE,To tread the humble paths of earth.
914,MY LOVE,
915,MY LOVE,"Blessing she is: God made her so,"
916,MY LOVE,And deeds of week-day holiness
917,MY LOVE,"Fall from her noiseless as the snow,"
918,MY LOVE,Nor hath she ever chanced to know
919,MY LOVE,That aught were easier than to bless.
920,MY LOVE,
921,MY LOVE,"She is most fair, and thereunto"
922,MY LOVE,Her life doth rightly harmonize;
923,MY LOVE,Feeling or thought that was not true
924,MY LOVE,Ne'er made less beautiful the blue
925,MY LOVE,Unclouded heaven of her eyes.
926,MY LOVE,
927,MY LOVE,She is a woman: one in whom
928,MY LOVE,The spring-time of her childish years
929,MY LOVE,"Hath never lost its fresh perfume,"
930,MY LOVE,Though knowing well that life hath room
931,MY LOVE,For many blights and many tears.
932,MY LOVE,
933,MY LOVE,I love her with a love as still
934,MY LOVE,"As a broad river's peaceful might,"
935,MY LOVE,"Which, by high tower and lowly mill,"
936,MY LOVE,"Seems following its own wayward will,"
937,MY LOVE,And yet doth ever flow aright.
938,MY LOVE,
939,MY LOVE,"And, on its full, deep breast serene,"
940,MY LOVE,Like quiet isles my duties lie;
941,MY LOVE,"It flows around them and between,"
942,MY LOVE,"And makes them fresh and fair and green,"
943,MY LOVE,Sweet homes wherein to live and die.
944,MY LOVE,

947,SUMMER STORM,SUMMER STORM
948,SUMMER STORM,
949,SUMMER STORM,"Untremulous in the river clear,"
950,SUMMER STORM,"Toward the sky's image, hangs the imaged bridge;"
951,SUMMER STORM,So still the air that I can hear
952,SUMMER STORM,The slender clarion of the unseen midge;
953,SUMMER STORM,"Out of the stillness, with a gathering creep,"
954,SUMMER STORM,"Like rising wind in leaves, which now decreases,"
955,SUMMER STORM,"Now lulls, now swells, and all the while increases,"
956,SUMMER STORM,The huddling trample of a drove of sheep
957,SUMMER STORM,"Tilts the loose planks, and then as gradually ceases"
958,SUMMER STORM,"In dust on the other side; life's emblem deep,            10"
959,SUMMER STORM,"A confused noise between two silences,"
960,SUMMER STORM,Finding at last in dust precarious peace.
961,SUMMER STORM,On the wide marsh the purple-blossomed grasses
962,SUMMER STORM,"Soak up the sunshine; sleeps the brimming tide,"
963,SUMMER STORM,Save when the wedge-shaped wake in silence passes
964,SUMMER STORM,"Of some slow water-rat, whose sinuous glide"
965,SUMMER STORM,Wavers the sedge's emerald shade from side to side;
966,SUMMER STORM,
967,SUMMER STORM,"But up the west, like a rock-shivered surge,"
968,SUMMER STORM,Climbs a great cloud edged with sun-whitened spray;
969,SUMMER STORM,"Huge whirls of foam boil toppling o'er its verge,           20"
970,SUMMER STORM,"And falling still it seems, and yet it climbs alway."
971,SUMMER STORM,
972,SUMMER STORM,Suddenly all the sky is hid
973,SUMMER STORM,"As with the shutting of a lid,"
974,SUMMER STORM,One by one great drops are falling
975,SUMMER STORM,"Doubtful and slow,"
976,SUMMER STORM,"Down the pane they are crookedly crawling,"
977,SUMMER STORM,And the wind breathes low;
978,SUMMER STORM,"Slowly the circles widen on the river,"
979,SUMMER STORM,"Widen and mingle, one and all;"
980,SUMMER STORM,"Here and there the slenderer flowers shiver,               30"
981,SUMMER STORM,Struck by an icy rain-drop's fall.
982,SUMMER STORM,
983,SUMMER STORM,"Now on the hills I hear the thunder mutter,"
984,SUMMER STORM,The wind is gathering in the west;
985,SUMMER STORM,"The upturned leaves first whiten and flutter,"
986,SUMMER STORM,Then droop to a fitful rest;
987,SUMMER STORM,Up from the stream with sluggish flap
988,SUMMER STORM,Struggles the gull and floats away;
989,SUMMER STORM,"Nearer and nearer rolls the thunder-clap,--"
990,SUMMER STORM,We shall not see the sun go down to-day:
991,SUMMER STORM,"Now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh,                        40"
992,SUMMER STORM,"And tramples the grass with terrified feet,"
993,SUMMER STORM,"The startled river turns leaden and harsh,"
994,SUMMER STORM,You can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat.
995,SUMMER STORM,
996,SUMMER STORM,Look! look! that livid flash!
997,SUMMER STORM,"And instantly follows the rattling thunder,"
998,SUMMER STORM,"As if some cloud-crag, split asunder,"
999,SUMMER STORM,"Fell, splintering with a ruinous crash,"
1000,SUMMER STORM,"On the Earth, which crouches in silence under;"
1001,SUMMER STORM,And now a solid gray wall of rain
1002,SUMMER STORM,"Shuts off the landscape, mile by mile;                      50"
1003,SUMMER STORM,"For a breath's space I see the blue wood again,"
1004,SUMMER STORM,"And ere the next heart-beat, the wind-hurled pile,"
1005,SUMMER STORM,"That seemed but now a league aloof,"
1006,SUMMER STORM,Bursts crackling o'er the sun-parched roof;
1007,SUMMER STORM,"Against the windows the storm comes dashing,"
1008,SUMMER STORM,"Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing,"
1009,SUMMER STORM,"The blue lightning flashes,"
1010,SUMMER STORM,"The rapid hail clashes,"
1011,SUMMER STORM,"The white waves are tumbling,"
1012,SUMMER STORM,"And, in one baffled roar,                               60"
1013,SUMMER STORM,Like the toothless sea mumbling
1014,SUMMER STORM,"A rock-bristled shore,"
1015,SUMMER STORM,The thunder is rumbling
1016,SUMMER STORM,"And crashing and crumbling,--"
1017,SUMMER STORM,Will silence return nevermore?
1018,SUMMER STORM,
1019,SUMMER STORM,"Hush! Still as death,"
1020,SUMMER STORM,The tempest holds his breath
1021,SUMMER STORM,As from a sudden will;
1022,SUMMER STORM,"The rain stops short, but from the eaves"
1023,SUMMER STORM,"You see it drop, and hear it from the leaves,               70"
1024,SUMMER STORM,All is so bodingly still;
1025,SUMMER STORM,"Again, now, now, again"
1026,SUMMER STORM,"Plashes the rain in heavy gouts,"
1027,SUMMER STORM,The crinkled lightning
1028,SUMMER STORM,"Seems ever brightening,"
1029,SUMMER STORM,And loud and long
1030,SUMMER STORM,Again the thunder shouts
1031,SUMMER STORM,"His battle-song,--"
1032,SUMMER STORM,"One quivering flash,"
1033,SUMMER STORM,"One wildering crash,                                80"
1034,SUMMER STORM,"Followed by silence dead and dull,"
1035,SUMMER STORM,
1036,SUMMER STORM,"As if the cloud, let go,"
1037,SUMMER STORM,Leapt bodily below
1038,SUMMER STORM,To whelm the earth in one mad overthrow.
1039,SUMMER STORM,And then a total lull.
1040,SUMMER STORM,
1041,SUMMER STORM,"Gone, gone, so soon!"
1042,SUMMER STORM,"No more my half-dazed fancy there,"
1043,SUMMER STORM,"Can shape a giant In the air,"
1044,SUMMER STORM,"No more I see his streaming hair,"
1045,SUMMER STORM,The writhing portent of his form;--                      90
1046,SUMMER STORM,The pale and quiet moon
1047,SUMMER STORM,"Makes her calm forehead bare,"
1048,SUMMER STORM,"And the last fragments of the storm,"
1049,SUMMER STORM,"Like shattered rigging from a fight at sea,"
1050,SUMMER STORM,"Silent and few, are drifting over me."

1054,LOVE,LOVE
1055,LOVE,
1056,LOVE,"True Love is but a humble, low-born thing,"
1057,LOVE,And hath its food served up in earthen ware;
1058,LOVE,"It is a thing to walk with, hand in hand,"
1059,LOVE,"Through the everydayness of this workday world,"
1060,LOVE,"Baring its tender feet to every flint,"
1061,LOVE,Yet letting not one heart-beat go astray
1062,LOVE,From Beauty's law of plainness and content;
1063,LOVE,"A simple, fireside thing, whose quiet smile"
1064,LOVE,Can warm earth's poorest hovel to a home;
1065,LOVE,"Which, when our autumn cometh, as it must,"
1066,LOVE,"And life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless,"
1067,LOVE,Shall still be blest with Indian-summer youth
1068,LOVE,"In bleak November, and, with thankful heart,"
1069,LOVE,"Smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit,"
1070,LOVE,As full of sunshine to our aged eyes
1071,LOVE,As when it nursed the blossoms of our spring.
1072,LOVE,"Such is true Love, which steals into the heart"
1073,LOVE,With feet as silent as the lightsome dawn
1074,LOVE,"That kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark,"
1075,LOVE,"And hath its will through blissful gentleness,"
1076,LOVE,"Not like a rocket, which, with passionate glare,"
1077,LOVE,"Whirs suddenly up, then bursts, and leaves the night"
1078,LOVE,Painfully quivering on the dazèd eyes;
1079,LOVE,"A love that gives and takes, that seeth faults,"
1080,LOVE,"Not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle points,"
1081,LOVE,But loving-kindly ever looks them down
1082,LOVE,With the o'ercoming faith that still forgives;
1083,LOVE,"A love that shall be new and fresh each hour,"
1084,LOVE,"As is the sunset's golden mystery,"
1085,LOVE,"Or the sweet coming of the evening-star,"
1086,LOVE,"Alike, and yet most unlike, every day,"
1087,LOVE,And seeming ever best and fairest _now_;
1088,LOVE,"A love that doth not kneel for what it seeks,"
1089,LOVE,"But faces Truth and Beauty as their peer,"
1090,LOVE,Showing its worthiness of noble thoughts
1091,LOVE,By a clear sense of inward nobleness;
1092,LOVE,A love that in its object findeth not
1093,LOVE,"All grace and beauty, and enough to sate"
1094,LOVE,"Its thirst of blessing, but, in all of good"
1095,LOVE,"Found there, sees but the Heaven-implanted types"
1096,LOVE,"Of good and beauty in the soul of man,"
1097,LOVE,"And traces, in the simplest heart that beats,"
1098,LOVE,"A family-likeness to its chosen one,"
1099,LOVE,That claims of it the rights of brotherhood.
1100,LOVE,"For love is blind but with the fleshly eye,"
1101,LOVE,That so its inner sight may be more clear;
1102,LOVE,And outward shows of beauty only so
1103,LOVE,"Are needful at the first, as is a hand"
1104,LOVE,To guide and to uphold an infant's steps:
1105,LOVE,Fine natures need them not: their earnest look
1106,LOVE,"Pierces the body's mask of thin disguise,"
1107,LOVE,"And beauty ever is to them revealed,"
1108,LOVE,"Behind the unshapeliest, meanest lump of clay,"
1109,LOVE,"With arms outstretched and eager face ablaze,"
1110,LOVE,Yearning to be but understood and loved.
1111,LOVE,

1211,THE MOON,THE MOON
1212,THE MOON,
1213,THE MOON,My soul was like the sea.
1214,THE MOON,"Before the moon was made,"
1215,THE MOON,"Moaning in vague immensity,"
1216,THE MOON,"Of its own strength afraid,"
1217,THE MOON,Unresful and unstaid.
1218,THE MOON,"Through every rift it foamed in vain,"
1219,THE MOON,"About its earthly prison,"
1220,THE MOON,"Seeking some unknown thing in pain,"
1221,THE MOON,"And sinking restless back again,"
1222,THE MOON,For yet no moon had risen:
1223,THE MOON,"Its only voice a vast dumb moan,"
1224,THE MOON,"Of utterless anguish speaking,"
1225,THE MOON,"It lay unhopefully alone,"
1226,THE MOON,And lived but in an aimless seeking.
1227,THE MOON,
1228,THE MOON,So was my soul; but when 'twas full
1229,THE MOON,"Of unrest to o'erloading,"
1230,THE MOON,A voice of something beautiful
1231,THE MOON,"Whispered a dim foreboding,"
1232,THE MOON,"And yet so soft, so sweet, so low,"
1233,THE MOON,It had not more of joy than woe;
1234,THE MOON,
1235,THE MOON,"And, as the sea doth oft lie still,"
1236,THE MOON,"Making its waters meet,"
1237,THE MOON,"As if by an unconscious will,"
1238,THE MOON,"For the moon's silver feet,"
1239,THE MOON,So lay my soul within mine eyes
1240,THE MOON,"When thou, its guardian moon, didst rise."
1241,THE MOON,
1242,THE MOON,"And now, howe'er its waves above"
1243,THE MOON,"May toss and seem uneaseful,"

1404,I,"In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder,"
1405,I,The Poet's song with blood-warm truth was rife;
1406,I,He saw the mysteries which circle under
1407,I,The outward shell and skin of daily life.
1408,I,"Nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion,"
1409,I,His soul was led by the eternal law;
1410,I,"There was in him no hope of fame, no passion,"
1411,I,"But with calm, godlike eyes he only saw."
1412,I,"He did not sigh o'er heroes dead and buried,"
1413,I,"Chief-mourner at the Golden Age's hearse,     10"
1414,I,Nor deem that souls whom Charon grim had ferried
1415,I,Alone were fitting themes of epic verse:
1416,I,"He could believe the promise of to-morrow,"
1417,I,And feel the wondrous meaning of to-day;
1418,I,He had a deeper faith in holy sorrow
1419,I,Than the world's seeming loss could take away.
1420,I,"To know the heart of all things was his duty,"
1421,I,"All things did sing to him to make him wise,"
1422,I,"And, with a sorrowful and conquering beauty,"
1423,I,The soul of all looked grandly from his eyes.     20
1424,I,"He gazed on all within him and without him,"
1425,I,"He watched the flowing of Time's steady tide,"
1426,I,And shapes of glory floated all about him
1427,I,"And whispered to him, and he prophesied."
1428,I,"Than all men he more fearless was and freer,"
1429,I,"And all his brethren cried with one accord,--"
1430,I,'Behold the holy man! Behold the Seer!
1431,I,Him who hath spoken with the unseen Lord!'
1432,I,He to his heart with large embrace had taken
1433,I,"The universal sorrow of mankind,                 30"
1434,I,"And, from that root, a shelter never shaken,"
1435,I,The tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind.
1436,I,He could interpret well the wondrous voices
1437,I,Which to the calm and silent spirit come;
1438,I,He knew that the One Soul no more rejoices
1439,I,In the star's anthem than the insect's hum.
1440,I,He in his heart was ever meek and humble.
1441,I,"And yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran,"
1442,I,As he foresaw how all things false should crumble
1443,I,"Before the free, uplifted soul of man;           40"
1444,I,"And, when he was made full to overflowing"
1445,I,"With all the loveliness of heaven and earth,"
1446,I,"Out rushed his song, like molten iron glowing,"
1447,I,To show God sitting by the humblest hearth.
1448,I,With calmest courage he was ever ready
1449,I,"To teach that action was the truth of thought,"
1450,I,"And, with strong arm and purpose firm and steady,"
1451,I,An anchor for the drifting world he wrought.
1452,I,So did he make the meanest man partaker
1453,I,Of all his brother-gods unto him gave;            50
1454,I,"All souls did reverence him and name him Maker,"
1455,I,And when he died heaped temples on his grave.
1456,I,And still his deathless words of light are swimming
1457,I,Serene throughout the great deep infinite
1458,I,"Of human soul, unwaning and undimming,"
1459,I,To cheer and guide the mariner at night.

1467,II,To all men's prides and fancies as they pass.      60
1468,II,"Not his the song, which, in its metre holy,"
1469,II,"Chimes with the music of the eternal stars,"
1470,II,"Humbling the tyrant, lifting up the lowly,"
1471,II,And sending sun through the soul's prison-bars.
1472,II,"Maker no more,--oh no! unmaker rather,"
1473,II,For he unmakes who doth not all put forth
1474,II,The power given freely by our loving Father
1475,II,"To show the body's dross, the spirit's worth."
1476,II,Awake! great spirit of the ages olden!
1477,II,"Shiver the mists that hide thy starry lyre,      70"
1478,II,And let man's soul be yet again beholden
1479,II,To thee for wings to soar to her desire.
1480,II,"Oh, prophesy no more to-morrow's splendor,"
1481,II,"Be no more shamefaced to speak out for Truth,"
1482,II,"Lay on her altar all the gushings tender,"
1483,II,"The hope, the fire, the loving faith of youth!"
1484,II,"Oh, prophesy no more the Maker's coming,"
1485,II,Say not his onward footsteps thou canst hear
1486,II,"In the dim void, like to the awful humming"
1487,II,Of the great wings of some new-lighted sphere!     80
1488,II,"Oh, prophesy no more, but be the Poet!"
1489,II,This longing was but granted unto thee
1490,II,"That, when all beauty thou couldst feel and know it,"
1491,II,That beauty in its highest thou shouldst be.
1492,II,"O thou who moanest tost with sealike longings,"
1493,II,"Who dimly hearest voices call on thee,"
1494,II,Whose soul is overfilled with mighty throngings
1495,II,"Of love, and fear, and glorious agony."
1496,II,Thou of the toil-strung hands and iron sinews
1497,II,"And soul by Mother Earth with freedom fed,      90"
1498,II,"In whom the hero-spirit yet continues,"
1499,II,"The old free nature is not chained or dead,"
1500,II,"Arouse! let thy soul break in music-thunder,"
1501,II,"Let loose the ocean that is in thee pent,"
1502,II,"Pour forth thy hope, thy fear, thy love, thy wonder,"
1503,II,And tell the age what all its signs have meant.
1504,II,"Where'er thy wildered crowd of brethren jostles,"
1505,II,"Where'er there lingers but a shadow of wrong,"
1506,II,"There still is need of martyrs and apostles,"
1507,II,There still are texts for never-dying song:     100
1508,II,From age to age man's still aspiring spirit
1509,II,"Finds wider scope and sees with clearer eyes,"
1510,II,And thou in larger measure dost inherit
1511,II,What made thy great forerunners free and wise.
1512,II,Sit thou enthronèd where the Poet's mountain
1513,II,"Above the thunder lifts its silent peak,"
1514,II,"And roll thy songs down like a gathering fountain,"
1515,II,They all may drink and find the rest they seek.
1516,II,"Sing! there shall silence grow in earth and heaven,"
1517,II,A silence of deep awe and wondering;            110
1518,II,"For, listening gladly, bend the angels, even,"
1519,II,To hear a mortal like an angel sing.

1527,III,Which every age demands to do it right.
1528,III,Proprieties our silken bards environ;
1529,III,He who would be the tongue of this wide land
1530,III,Must string his harp with chords of sturdy iron

1533,III,"Who hath learnt wisdom from her mystic books,"
1534,III,"Whose soul with all her countless lives hath blended,"
1535,III,So that all beauty awes us in his looks:
1536,III,"Who not with body's waste his soul hath pampered,"
1537,III,"Who as the clear northwestern wind is free,"
1538,III,"Who walks with Form's observances unhampered,"
1539,III,And follows the One Will obediently;
1540,III,"Whose eyes, like windows on a breezy summit,"
1541,III,Control a lovely prospect every way;      130
1542,III,"Who doth not sound God's sea with earthly plummet,"
1543,III,And find a bottom still of worthless clay;
1544,III,"Who heeds not how the lower gusts are working,"
1545,III,"Knowing that one sure wind blows on above,"
1546,III,"And sees, beneath the foulest faces lurking,"
1547,III,One God-built shrine of reverence and love;
1548,III,Who sees all stars that wheel their shining marches
1549,III,"Around the centre fixed of Destiny,"
1550,III,Where the encircling soul serene o'erarches
1551,III,The moving globe of being like a sky;      140
1552,III,Who feels that God and Heaven's great deeps are nearer
1553,III,"Him to whose heart his fellow-man is nigh,"
1554,III,Who doth not hold his soul's own freedom dearer
1555,III,"Than that of all his brethren, low or high;"
1556,III,Who to the Right can feel himself the truer
1557,III,"For being gently patient with the wrong,"
1558,III,"Who sees a brother in the evildoer,"
1559,III,And finds in Love the heart's-blood of his song;--
1560,III,"This, this is he for whom the world is waiting"
1561,III,"To sing the beatings of its mighty heart,      150"
1562,III,Too long hath it been patient with the grating
1563,III,"Of scrannel-pipes, and heard it misnamed Art."
1564,III,"To him the smiling soul of man shall listen,"
1565,III,"Laying awhile its crown of thorns aside,"
1566,III,And once again in every eye shall glisten
1567,III,The glory of a nature satisfied.
1568,III,"His verse shall have a great commanding motion,"
1569,III,Heaving and swelling with a melody
1570,III,"Learnt of the sky, the river, and the ocean,"
1571,III,"And all the pure, majestic things that be.      160"
1572,III,"Awake, then, thou! we pine for thy great presence"
1573,III,"To make us feel the soul once more sublime,"
1574,III,We are of far too infinite an essence
1575,III,To rest contented with the lies of Time.
1576,III,Speak out! and lo! a hush of deepest wonder
1577,III,"Shall sink o'er all this many-voicèd scene,"
1578,III,As when a sudden burst of rattling thunder
1579,III,Shatters the blueness of a sky serene.

1676,THE FORLORN,
1677,THE FORLORN,"Outside the porch before the door,"
1678,THE FORLORN,"Her cheek upon the cold, hard stone,"
1679,THE FORLORN,"She lies, no longer foul and poor,"
1680,THE FORLORN,No longer dreary and alone.
1681,THE FORLORN,
1682,THE FORLORN,Next morning something heavily
1683,THE FORLORN,"Against the opening door did weigh,"
1684,THE FORLORN,"And there, from sin and sorrow free,"
1685,THE FORLORN,A woman on the threshold lay.
1686,THE FORLORN,
1687,THE FORLORN,A smile upon the wan lips told
1688,THE FORLORN,"That she had found a calm release,"
1689,THE FORLORN,"And that, from out the want and cold,"
1690,THE FORLORN,The song had borne her soul in peace.
1691,THE FORLORN,
1692,THE FORLORN,"For, whom the heart of man shuts out,"
1693,THE FORLORN,"Sometimes the heart of God takes in,"
1694,THE FORLORN,And fences them all round about
1695,THE FORLORN,With silence mid the world's loud din;
1696,THE FORLORN,
1697,THE FORLORN,And one of his great charities
1698,THE FORLORN,"Is Music, and it doth not scorn"
1699,THE FORLORN,To close the lids upon the eyes
1700,THE FORLORN,Of the polluted and forlorn;
1701,THE FORLORN,
1702,THE FORLORN,"Far was she from her childhood's home,"
1703,THE FORLORN,"Farther in guilt had wandered thence,"
1704,THE FORLORN,Yet thither it had bid her come
1705,THE FORLORN,To die in maiden innocence.

1718,MIDNIGHT,A vague and starry magic
1719,MIDNIGHT,"Makes all things mysteries,"

1730,MIDNIGHT,The dreaming cock doth crow.
1731,MIDNIGHT,
1732,MIDNIGHT,"All things look strange and mystic,"
1733,MIDNIGHT,The very bushes swell

1737,MIDNIGHT,From childhood known so well.

1739,MIDNIGHT,The snow of deepest silence
1740,MIDNIGHT,"O'er everything doth fall,"

1745,MIDNIGHT,
1746,MIDNIGHT,"O wild and wondrous midnight,"

1750,MIDNIGHT,And give it some faint glimpses
1751,MIDNIGHT,Of immortality!

1862,I,"Gazing on the roaring sea,"
1863,I,"'Take this rose,' he sighed, 'and throw it"
1864,I,Where there's none that loveth me.
1865,I,On the rock the billow bursteth
1866,I,"And sinks back into the seas,"
1867,I,But in vain my spirit thirsteth
1868,I,So to burst and be at ease.
1869,I,"Take, O sea! the tender blossom"
1870,I,That hath lain against my breast;
1871,I,On thy black and angry bosom
1872,I,It will find a surer rest.
1873,I,"Life is vain, and love is hollow,"
1874,I,"Ugly death stands there behind,"
1875,I,Hate and scorn and hunger follow
1876,I,Him that toileth for his kind.'
1877,I,"Forth into the night he hurled it,"
1878,I,And with bitter smile did mark
1879,I,How the surly tempest whirled it
1880,I,Swift into the hungry dark.
1881,I,"Foam and spray drive back to leeward,"
1882,I,"And the gale, with dreary moan,"
1883,I,"Drifts the helpless blossom seaward,"

1900,II,Mine with love forevermore!'
1901,II,"Swells the tide and overflows it,"
1902,II,"But, with omen pure and meet,"
1903,II,"Brings a little rose, and throws it"
1904,II,Humbly at the maiden's feet.
1905,II,"Full of bliss she takes the token,"

1907,II,Soothes the ruffled petals broken
1908,II,With the ocean's fierce unrest.
1909,II,"'Love is thine, O heart! and surely"

1921,III,Up the beach the ocean slideth
1922,III,"With a whisper of delight,"

1924,III,Through the peaceful blue of night.

1927,III,"Maiden lips, with love grown bolder,"

1929,III,"'Life is joy, and love is power,"

1931,III,Strength and wisdom only flower
1932,III,When we toil for all our kind.
1933,III,"Hope is truth,--the future giveth"
1934,III,"More than present takes away,"

1937,III,"Not a word the maiden uttered,"

2037,ROSALINE,
2038,ROSALINE,"Above thy grave the robin sings,"

2042,ROSALINE,"The violets in the hillock toss,"
2043,ROSALINE,The gravestone is o'ergrown with moss;
2044,ROSALINE,"For nature feels not any loss,"

2046,ROSALINE,
2047,ROSALINE,I did not know when thou wast dead;

2049,ROSALINE,"Thrilled through my brain; I would have fled,"
2050,ROSALINE,"But dared not leave thee, Rosaline!"
2051,ROSALINE,"The sun rolled down, and very soon,"
2052,ROSALINE,"Like a great fire, the awful moon"
2053,ROSALINE,"Rose, stained with blood, and then a swoon"
2054,ROSALINE,"Crept chilly o'er me, Rosaline!"
2055,ROSALINE,
2056,ROSALINE,"The stars came out; and, one by one,"
2057,ROSALINE,Each angel from his silver throne
2058,ROSALINE,Looked down and saw what I had done:
2059,ROSALINE,"I dared not hide me, Rosaline!            60"
2060,ROSALINE,I crouched; I feared thy corpse would cry
2061,ROSALINE,"Against me to God's silent sky,"
2062,ROSALINE,I thought I saw the blue lips try
2063,ROSALINE,"To utter something, Rosaline!"
2064,ROSALINE,
2065,ROSALINE,I waited with a maddened grin
2066,ROSALINE,To hear that voice all icy thin
2067,ROSALINE,Slide forth and tell my deadly sin
2068,ROSALINE,"To hell and heaven, Rosaline!"
2069,ROSALINE,"But no voice came, and then it seemed,"
2070,ROSALINE,"That, if the very corpse had screamed,     70"
2071,ROSALINE,The sound like sunshine glad had streamed
2072,ROSALINE,"Through that dark stillness, Rosaline!"
2073,ROSALINE,
2074,ROSALINE,"And then, amid the silent night,"
2075,ROSALINE,"I screamed with horrible delight,"
2076,ROSALINE,And in my brain an awful light
2077,ROSALINE,"Did seem to crackle, Rosaline!"
2078,ROSALINE,It is my curse! sweet memories fall
2079,ROSALINE,"From me like snow, and only all"
2080,ROSALINE,"Of that one night, like cold worms, crawl"
2081,ROSALINE,"My doomed heart over, Rosaline!           80"
2082,ROSALINE,
2083,ROSALINE,"Why wilt thou haunt me with thine eyes,"
2084,ROSALINE,"Wherein such blessed memories,"
2085,ROSALINE,"Such pitying forgiveness lies,"
2086,ROSALINE,"Than hate more bitter, Rosaline!"
2087,ROSALINE,Woe's me! I know that love so high
2088,ROSALINE,"As thine, true soul, could never die,"
2089,ROSALINE,"And with mean clay in churchyard lie,--"
2090,ROSALINE,"Would it might be so, Rosaline!"

2938,II,"Out of his grasp when he to tell it stirs,"
2939,II,Like that sad Dryad doomed no more to bless
2940,II,The mortal who revealed her loveliness.
2941,II,
2942,II,
2943,III,III
2944,III,
2945,III,"She dwelt forever in a region bright,"
2946,III,"Peopled with living fancies of her own,"
2947,III,"Where naught could come but visions of delight,"
2948,III,"Far, far aloof from earth's eternal moan:      20"
2949,III,"A summer cloud thrilled through with rosy light,"
2950,III,"Floating beneath the blue sky all alone,"
2951,III,"Her spirit wandered by itself, and won"
2952,III,A golden edge from some unsetting sun.

2957,IV,"The heart grows richer that its lot is poor,"
2958,IV,"God blesses want with larger sympathies,"
2959,IV,"Love enters gladliest at the humble door,"
2960,IV,And makes the cot a palace with his eyes;
2961,IV,"So Margaret's heart a softer beauty wore,"
2962,IV,"And grew in gentleness and patience wise,      30"
2963,IV,"For she was but a simple herdsman's child,"
2964,IV,A lily chance-sown in the rugged wild.
2965,IV,
2966,IV,
2967,V,V
2968,V,
2969,V,There was no beauty of the wood or field
2970,V,"But she its fragrant bosom-secret knew,"
2971,V,Nor any but to her would freely yield
2972,V,Some grace that in her soul took root and grew;
2973,V,"Nature to her shone as but now revealed,"
2974,V,"All rosy-fresh with innocent morning dew,"
2975,V,"And looked into her heart with dim, sweet eyes"
2976,V,That left it full of sylvan memories.      40
2977,V,
2978,V,
2979,VI,VI
2980,VI,
2981,VI,"Oh, what a face was hers to brighten light,"
2982,VI,"And give back sunshine with an added glow,"
2983,VI,"To wile each moment with a fresh delight,"
2984,VI,And part of memory's best contentment grow!
2985,VI,"Oh, how her voice, as with an inmate's right,"
2986,VI,"Into the strangest heart would welcome go,"
2987,VI,"And make it sweet, and ready to become"
2988,VI,Of white and gracious thoughts the chosen home!
2989,VI,
2990,VI,
2991,VII,VII
2992,VII,
2993,VII,None looked upon her but he straightway thought
2994,VII,"Of all the greenest depths of country cheer,      50"
2995,VII,And into each one's heart was freshly brought
2996,VII,"What was to him the sweetest time of year,"
2997,VII,So was her every look and motion fraught
2998,VII,With out-of-door delights and forest lere;
2999,VII,Not the first violet on a woodland lea
3000,VII,Seemed a more visible gift of Spring than she.
3001,VII,
3002,VII,
3003,VIII,VIII
3004,VIII,
3005,VIII,Is love learned only out of poets' books?
3006,VIII,"Is there not somewhat in the dropping flood,"
3007,VIII,"And in the nunneries of silent nooks,"
3008,VIII,"And in the murmured longing of the wood,      60"
3009,VIII,"That could make Margaret dream of lovelorn looks,"
3010,VIII,And stir a thrilling mystery in her blood
3011,VIII,More trembly secret than Aurora's tear
3012,VIII,Shed in the bosom of an eglatere?
3013,VIII,
3014,VIII,
3015,IX,IX
3016,IX,
3017,IX,"Full many a sweet forewarning hath the mind,"
3018,IX,"Full many a whispering of vague desire,"
3019,IX,Ere comes the nature destined to unbind
3020,IX,"Its virgin zone, and all its deeps inspire,--     70"
3021,IX,"Low stirrings in the leaves, before the wind"
3022,IX,"Wake all the green strings of the forest lyre,"
3023,IX,"Faint heatings in the calyx, ere the rose"
3024,IX,Its warm voluptuous breast doth all unclose.
3025,IX,
3026,IX,
3027,X,X
3028,X,
3029,X,"Long in its dim recesses pines the spirit,"
3030,X,"Wildered and dark, despairingly alone;"
3031,X,"Though many a shape of beauty wander near it,"
3032,X,And many a wild and half-remembered tone
3033,X,"Tremble from the divine abyss to cheer it,"
3034,X,Yet still it knows that there is only one
3035,X,Before whom it can kneel and tribute bring.
3036,X,At once a happy vassal and a king.      80

3038,X,
3039,XI,XI
3040,XI,
3041,XI,"To feel a want, yet scarce know what it is,"
3042,XI,"To seek one nature that is always new,"
3043,XI,"Whose glance is warmer than another's kiss,"
3044,XI,"Whom we can bare our inmost beauty to,"
3045,XI,"Nor feel deserted afterwards,--for this"
3046,XI,"But with our destined co-mate we can do,--"
3047,XI,Such longing instinct fills the mighty scope
3048,XI,Of the young soul with one mysterious hope.
3049,XI,
3050,XI,
3051,XII,XII
3052,XII,
3053,XII,So Margaret's heart grew brimming with the lore
3054,XII,Of love's enticing secrets; and although       90
3055,XII,"She had found none to cast it down before,"
3056,XII,Yet oft to Fancy's chapel she would go
3057,XII,To pay her vows--and count the rosary o'er
3058,XII,Of her love's promised graces:--haply so
3059,XII,Miranda's hope had pictured Ferdinand
3060,XII,Long ere the gaunt wave tossed him on the strand.
3061,XII,
3062,XII,
3063,XIII,XIII
3064,XIII,
3065,XIII,"A new-made star that swims the lonely gloom,"
3066,XIII,"Unwedded yet and longing for the sun,"
3067,XIII,"Whose beams, the bride-gifts of the lavish groom,"
3068,XIII,"Blithely to crown the virgin planet run,      100"
3069,XIII,"Her being was, watching to see the bloom"
3070,XIII,Of love's fresh sunrise roofing one by one
3071,XIII,"Its clouds with gold, a triumph-arch to be"
3072,XIII,For him who came to hold her heart in fee.
3073,XIII,
3074,XIII,
3075,XIV,XIV
3076,XIV,
3077,XIV,Not far from Margaret's cottage dwelt a knight
3078,XIV,"Of the proud Templars, a sworn celibate,"
3079,XIV,Whose heart in secret fed upon the light
3080,XIV,"And dew of her ripe beauty, through the grate"
3081,XIV,Of his close vow catching what gleams he might
3082,XIV,"Of the free heaven, and cursing all too late      110"
3083,XIV,The cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in
3084,XIV,And turned life's crowning bliss to deadly sin.
3085,XIV,
3086,XIV,
3087,XV,XV
3088,XV,
3089,XV,"For he had met her in the wood by chance,"
3090,XV,"And, having drunk her beauty's wildering spell,"
3091,XV,His heart shook like the pennon of a lance
3092,XV,"That quivers in a breeze's sudden swell,"
3093,XV,"And thenceforth, in a close-infolded trance,"
3094,XV,From mistily golden deep to deep he fell;
3095,XV,Till earth did waver and fade far away
3096,XV,Beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay.      120
3097,XV,
3098,XV,
3099,XVI,XVI
3100,XVI,
3101,XVI,"A dark, proud man he was, whose half-blown youth"
3102,XVI,"Had shed its blossoms even in opening,"
3103,XVI,Leaving a few that with more winning ruth
3104,XVI,"Trembling around grave manhood's stem might cling,"
3105,XVI,"More sad than cheery, making, in good sooth,"
3106,XVI,"Like the fringed gentian, a late autumn spring:"
3107,XVI,"A twilight nature, braided light and gloom,"
3108,XVI,A youth half-smiling by an open tomb.
3109,XVI,
3110,XVI,
3111,XVII,XVII
3112,XVII,
3113,XVII,"Fair as an angel, who yet inly wore"
3114,XVII,A wrinkled heart foreboding his near fall;       130
3115,XVII,"Who saw him alway wished to know him more,"
3116,XVII,As if he were some fate's defiant thrall
3117,XVII,And nursed a dreaded secret at his core;
3118,XVII,"Little he loved, but power the most of all,"
3119,XVII,"And that he seemed to scorn, as one who knew"
3120,XVII,By what foul paths men choose to crawl thereto.
3121,XVII,
3122,XVII,
3123,XVIII,XVIII
3124,XVIII,
3125,XVIII,"He had been noble, but some great deceit"
3126,XVIII,Had turned his better instinct to a vice:
3127,XVIII,"He strove to think the world was all a cheat,"
3128,XVIII,"That power and fame were cheap at any price,       140"
3129,XVIII,That the sure way of being shortly great
3130,XVIII,"Was even to play life's game with loaded dice,"
3131,XVIII,Since he had tried the honest play and found
3132,XVIII,That vice and virtue differed but in sound.
3133,XVIII,
3134,XVIII,
3135,XIX,XIX
3136,XIX,
3137,XIX,Yet Margaret's sight redeemed him for a space
3138,XIX,From his own thraldom; man could never be
3139,XIX,A hypocrite when first such maiden grace
3140,XIX,Smiled in upon his heart; the agony
3141,XIX,Of wearing all day long a lying face
3142,XIX,"Fell lightly from him, and, a moment free,      150"
3143,XIX,Erect with wakened faith his spirit stood
3144,XIX,And scorned the weakness of his demon-mood.
3145,XIX,
3146,XIX,
3147,XX,XX
3148,XX,
3149,XX,"Like a sweet wind-harp to him was her thought,"
3150,XX,"Which would not let the common air come near,"
3151,XX,Till from its dim enchantment it had caught
3152,XX,A musical tenderness that brimmed his ear
3153,XX,With sweetness more ethereal than aught
3154,XX,Save silver-dropping snatches that whilere
3155,XX,Rained down from some sad angel's faithful harp
3156,XX,To cool her fallen lover's anguish sharp.      160
3157,XX,
3158,XX,
3159,XXI,XXI
3160,XXI,
3161,XXI,Deep in the forest was a little dell
3162,XXI,High overarchèd with the leafy sweep
3163,XXI,"Of a broad oak, through whose gnarled roots there fell"
3164,XXI,"A slender rill that sung itself to sleep,"
3165,XXI,Where its continuous toil had scooped a well
3166,XXI,To please the fairy folk; breathlessly deep
3167,XXI,"The stillness was, save when the dreaming brook"
3168,XXI,From its small urn a drizzly murmur shook.
3169,XXI,
3170,XXI,
3171,XXII,XXII
3172,XXII,
3173,XXII,The wooded hills sloped upward all around
3174,XXII,"With gradual rise, and made an even rim,      170"
3175,XXII,So that it seemed a mighty casque unbound
3176,XXII,"From some huge Titan's brow to lighten him,"
3177,XXII,"Ages ago, and left upon the ground."
3178,XXII,"Where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim,"
3179,XXII,Till after countless centuries it grew
3180,XXII,"Into this dell, the haunt of noontide dew."
3181,XXII,
3182,XXII,
3183,XXIII,XXIII
3184,XXIII,
3185,XXIII,"Dim vistas, sprinkled o'er with sun-flecked green,"
3186,XXIII,"Wound through the thickset trunks on every side,"
3187,XXIII,"And, toward the west, in fancy might be seen"
3188,XXIII,"A Gothic window in its blazing pride,      180"
3189,XXIII,"When the low sun, two arching elms between,"
3190,XXIII,"Lit up the leaves beyond, which, autumn-dyed"
3191,XXIII,"With lavish hues, would into splendor start,"
3192,XXIII,Shaming the labored panes of richest art.
3193,XXIII,
3194,XXIII,
3195,XXIV,XXIV
3196,XXIV,
3197,XXIV,"Here, leaning once against the old oak's trunk,"
3198,XXIV,"Mordred, for such was the young Templar's name,"
3199,XXIV,"Saw Margaret come; unseen, the falcon shrunk"
3200,XXIV,From the meek dove; sharp thrills of tingling flame
3201,XXIV,"Made him forget that he was vowed a monk,"
3202,XXIV,And all the outworks of his pride o'ercame:      190
3203,XXIV,"Flooded he seemed with bright delicious pain,"
3204,XXIV,As if a star had burst within his brain.
3205,XXIV,
3206,XXIV,
3207,XXV,XXV
3208,XXV,
3209,XXV,Such power hath beauty and frank innocence:
3210,XXV,"A flower bloomed forth, that sunshine glad to bless,"
3211,XXV,Even from his love's long leafless stem; the sense
3212,XXV,"Of exile from Hope's happy realm grew less,"
3213,XXV,"And thoughts of childish peace, he knew not whence,"
3214,XXV,"Thronged round his heart with many an old caress,"
3215,XXV,Melting the frost there into pearly dew
3216,XXV,That mirrored back his nature's morning-blue.      200

3219,XXVI,XXVI
3220,XXVI,
3221,XXVI,"She turned and saw him, but she felt no dread,"
3222,XXVI,"Her purity, like adamantine mail."
3223,XXVI,Did so encircle her; and yet her head
3224,XXVI,"She drooped, and made her golden hair her veil,"
3225,XXVI,"Through which a glow of rosiest lustre spread,"
3226,XXVI,"Then faded, and anon she stood all pale,"
3227,XXVI,As snow o'er which a blush of northern light
3228,XXVI,"Suddenly reddens, and as soon grows white."
3229,XXVI,
3230,XXVI,
3231,XXVII,XXVII
3232,XXVII,
3233,XXVII,"She thought of Tristrem and of Lancilot,"
3234,XXVII,"Of all her dreams, and of kind fairies' might,      210"
3235,XXVII,"And how that dell was deemed a haunted spot,"
3236,XXVII,Until there grew a mist before her sight.
3237,XXVII,"And where the present was she half forgot,"
3238,XXVII,"Borne backward through the realms of old delight,--"
3239,XXVII,"Then, starting up awake, she would have gone,"
3240,XXVII,Yet almost wished it might not be alone.

3243,XXVIII,XXVIII
3244,XXVIII,
3245,XXVIII,"How they went home together through the wood,"
3246,XXVIII,And how all life seemed focussed into one
3247,XXVIII,"Thought-dazzling spot that set ablaze the blood,"
3248,XXVIII,What need to tell? Fit language there is none      220
3249,XXVIII,For the heart's deepest things. Who ever wooed
3250,XXVIII,As in his boyish hope he would have done?
3251,XXVIII,"For, when the soul is fullest, the hushed tongue"
3252,XXVIII,Voicelessly trembles like a lute unstrung.
3253,XXVIII,
3254,XXVIII,
3255,XXIX,XXIX
3256,XXIX,
3257,XXIX,But all things carry the heart's messages
3258,XXIX,"And know it not, nor doth the heart well know,"
3259,XXIX,"But Nature hath her will; even as the bees,"
3260,XXIX,"Blithe go-betweens, fly singing to and fro"
3261,XXIX,With the fruit-quickening pollen;--hard if these
3262,XXIX,Found not some all unthought-of way to show      230
3263,XXIX,"Their secret each to each; and so they did,"
3264,XXIX,And one heart's flower-dust into the other slid.

3295,XXXII,Closes its leaves around its warm delight;
3296,XXXII,Whate'er in life is harsh or out of tune
3297,XXXII,"Is all shut out, no boding shade of blight"

3308,XXXIII,In her whole frame but quivered through and through      260
3309,XXXIII,"With this glad thought, and was a minister"
3310,XXXIII,"To do him fealty and service true,"

3408,VI,The crooked paths of ill to goodness tend;
3409,VI,Let Him judge Margaret! If to be the thrall
3410,VI,"Of love, and faith too generous to defend"
3411,VI,"Its very life from him she loved, be sin,"
3412,VI,What hope of grace may the seducer win?

3419,VII,"She that upon thy freezing threshold lies,"
3420,VII,"Starved to more sinning by thy savage ban,"
3421,VII,Seeking that refuge because foulest vice
3422,VII,"More godlike than thy virtue is, whose span"
3423,VII,"Shuts out the wretched only, is more free"
3424,VII,To enter heaven than thou shalt ever be!
3425,VII,
3426,VII,
3427,VIII,VIII
3428,VIII,
3429,VIII,Thou wilt not let her wash thy dainty feet
3430,VIII,"With such salt things as tears, or with rude hair"
3431,VIII,"Dry them, soft Pharisee, that sit'st at meat"
3432,VIII,"With him who made her such, and speak'st him fair.      340"
3433,VIII,Leaving God's wandering lamb the while to bleat
3434,VIII,"Unheeded, shivering in the pitiless air:"
3435,VIII,Thou hast made prisoned virtue show more wan
3436,VIII,And haggard than a vice to look upon.

3438,VIII,
3439,IX,IX
3440,IX,
3441,IX,"Now many months flew by, and weary grew"
3442,IX,To Margaret the sight of happy things;
3443,IX,"Blight fell on all her flowers, instead of dew;"
3444,IX,Shut round her heart were now the joyous wings
3445,IX,"Wherewith it wont to soar; yet not untrue,"
3446,IX,"Though tempted much, her woman's nature clings      350"
3447,IX,"To its first pure belief, and with sad eyes"
3448,IX,Looks backward o'er the gate of Paradise.

3454,X,And winter frowned where spring had laughed before
3455,X,"In his strange eyes, yet half her sadness doffed,"
3456,X,And in her silent patience loved him more:
3457,X,"Sorrow had made her soft heart yet more soft,"
3458,X,And a new life within her own she bore
3459,X,"Which made her tenderer, as she felt it move"
3460,X,"Beneath her breast, a refuge for her love.      360"

3462,X,
3463,XI,XI
3464,XI,
3465,XI,"This babe, she thought, would surely bring him back,"
3466,XI,And be a bond forever them between;
3467,XI,Before its eyes the sullen tempest-rack
3468,XI,"Would fade, and leave the face of heaven serene;"
3469,XI,"And love's return doth more than fill the lack,"
3470,XI,Which in his absence withered the heart's green:
3471,XI,And yet a dim foreboding still would flit
3472,XI,Between her and her hope to darken it.
3473,XI,
3474,XI,
3475,XII,XII
3476,XII,
3477,XII,"She could not figure forth a happy fate,"
3478,XII,Even for this life from heaven so newly come;      370
3479,XII,The earth must needs be doubly desolate
3480,XII,To him scarce parted from a fairer home:
3481,XII,Such boding heavier on her bosom sate
3482,XII,"One night, as, standing in the twilight gloam,"
3483,XII,She strained her eyes beyond that dizzy verge
3484,XII,At whose foot faintly breaks the future's surge.
3485,XII,
3486,XII,
3487,XIII,XIII
3488,XIII,
3489,XIII,Poor little spirit! naught but shame and woe
3490,XIII,Nurse the sick heart whose life-blood nurses thine:
3491,XIII,"Yet not those only; love hath triumphed so,"
3492,XIII,As for thy sake makes sorrow more divine:      380
3493,XIII,"And yet, though thou be pure, the world is foe"
3494,XIII,"To purity, if born in such a shrine;"
3495,XIII,"And, having trampled it for struggling thence,"
3496,XIII,"Smiles to itself, and calls it Providence."

3498,XIII,
3499,XIV,XIV
3500,XIV,
3501,XIV,"As thus she mused, a shadow seemed to rise"
3502,XIV,"From out her thought, and turn to dreariness"
3503,XIV,"All blissful hopes and sunny memories,"
3504,XIV,And the quick blood would curdle up and press
3505,XIV,"About her heart, which seemed to shut its eyes"
3506,XIV,"And hush itself, as who with shuddering guess      390"
3507,XIV,Harks through the gloom and dreads e'en now to feel
3508,XIV,Through his hot breast the icy slide of steel.
3509,XIV,
3510,XIV,
3511,XV,XV
3512,XV,
3513,XV,"But, at that heart-beat, while in dread she was,"
3514,XV,"In the low wind the honeysuckles gleam,"
3515,XV,"A dewy thrill flits through the heavy grass,"
3516,XV,"And, looking forth, she saw, as in a dream,"
3517,XV,Within the wood the moonlight's shadowy mass:
3518,XV,"Night's starry heart yearning to hers doth seem,"
3519,XV,"And the deep sky, full-hearted with the moon,"
3520,XV,Folds round her all the happiness of June.      400
3521,XV,
3522,XV,
3523,XVI,XVI
3524,XVI,
3525,XVI,What fear could face a heaven and earth like this?
3526,XVI,What silveriest cloud could hang 'neath such a sky?
3527,XVI,A tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss
3528,XVI,"Rolls back through all her pulses suddenly,"
3529,XVI,"As if some seraph, who had learned to kiss"
3530,XVI,"From the fair daughters of the world gone by,"
3531,XVI,"Had wedded so his fallen light with hers,"
3532,XVI,"Such sweet, strange joy through soul and body stirs."
3533,XVI,
3534,XVI,
3535,XVII,XVII
3536,XVII,
3537,XVII,Now seek we Mordred; he who did not fear
3538,XVII,"The crime, yet fears the latent consequence:      410"
3539,XVII,"If it should reach a brother Templar's ear,"
3540,XVII,It haply might be made a good pretence
3541,XVII,To cheat him of the hope he held most dear;
3542,XVII,"For he had spared no thought's or deed's expense,"
3543,XVII,That by and by might help his wish to clip
3544,XVII,"Its darling bride,--the high grandmastership."
3545,XVII,
3546,XVII,
3547,XVIII,XVIII
3548,XVIII,
3549,XVIII,"The apathy, ere a crime resolved is done,"
3550,XVIII,Is scarce less dreadful than remorse for crime;
3551,XVIII,By no allurement can the soul be won
3552,XVIII,From brooding o'er the weary creep of time:      420
3553,XVIII,"Mordred stole forth into the happy sun,"
3554,XVIII,"Striving to hum a scrap of Breton rhyme,"
3555,XVIII,"But the sky struck him speechless, and he tried"
3556,XVIII,In vain to summon up his callous pride.
3557,XVIII,
3558,XVIII,
3559,XIX,XIX
3560,XIX,
3561,XIX,"In the courtyard a fountain leaped alway,"
3562,XIX,A Triton blowing jewels through his shell
3563,XIX,"Into the sunshine; Mordred turned away,"
3564,XIX,Weary because the stone face did not tell
3565,XIX,"Of weariness, nor could he bear to-day,"
3566,XIX,"Heartsick, to hear the patient sink and swell      430"
3567,XIX,"Of winds among the leaves, or golden bees"
3568,XIX,Drowsily humming in the orange-trees.
3569,XIX,
3570,XIX,
3571,XX,XX
3572,XX,
3573,XX,All happy sights and sounds now came to him
3574,XX,"Like a reproach: he wandered far and wide,"
3575,XX,"Following the lead of his unquiet whim,"
3576,XX,But still there went a something at his side
3577,XX,"That made the cool breeze hot, the sunshine dim;"
3578,XX,"It would not flee, it could not be defied,"
3579,XX,"He could not see it, but he felt it there,"
3580,XX,By the damp chill that crept among his hair.      440
3581,XX,
3582,XX,
3583,XXI,XXI
3584,XXI,
3585,XXI,"Day wore at last; the evening-star arose,"
3586,XXI,And throbbing in the sky grew red and set;
3587,XXI,"Then with a guilty, wavering step he goes"
3588,XXI,To the hid nook where they so oft had met
3589,XXI,"In happier season, for his heart well knows"
3590,XXI,That he is sure to find poor Margaret
3591,XXI,Watching and waiting there with love-lorn breast
3592,XXI,Around her young dream's rudely scattered nest.
3593,XXI,
3594,XXI,
3595,XXII,XXII
3596,XXII,
3597,XXII,Why follow here that grim old chronicle
3598,XXII,Which counts the dagger-strokes and drops of blood?      450
3599,XXII,"Enough that Margaret by his mad steel fell,"
3600,XXII,"Unmoved by murder from her trusting mood,"
3601,XXII,"Smiling on him as Heaven smiles on Hell,"
3602,XXII,"With a sad love, remembering when he stood"
3603,XXII,"Not fallen yet, the unsealer of her heart,"
3604,XXII,Of all her holy dreams the holiest part.
3605,XXII,
3606,XXII,
3607,XXIII,XXIII
3608,XXIII,
3609,XXIII,"His crime complete, scarce knowing what he did,"
3610,XXIII,"(So goes the tale,) beneath the altar there"
3611,XXIII,"In the high church the stiffening corpse he hid,"
3612,XXIII,"And then, to 'scape that suffocating air,      460"
3613,XXIII,Like a scared ghoul out of the porch he slid;
3614,XXIII,"But his strained eyes saw blood-spots everywhere,"
3615,XXIII,And ghastly faces thrust themselves between
3616,XXIII,His soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien.
3617,XXIII,
3618,XXIII,
3619,XXIV,XXIV
3620,XXIV,
3621,XXIV,His heart went out within him like a spark
3622,XXIV,Dropt in the sea; wherever he made bold
3623,XXIV,"To turn his eyes, he saw, all stiff and stark,"
3624,XXIV,Pale Margaret lying dead; the lavish gold
3625,XXIV,Of her loose hair seemed in the cloudy dark
3626,XXIV,"To spread a glory, and a thousand-fold      470"
3627,XXIV,More strangely pale and beautiful she grew:
3628,XXIV,Her silence stabbed his conscience through and through.
3629,XXIV,
3630,XXIV,
3631,XXV,XXV
3632,XXV,
3633,XXV,"Or visions of past days,--a mother's eyes"
3634,XXV,"That smiled down on the fair boy at her knee,"
3635,XXV,Whose happy upturned face to hers replies.--
3636,XXV,He saw sometimes: or Margaret mournfully
3637,XXV,"Gazed on him full of doubt, as one who tries"
3638,XXV,To crush belief that does love injury;
3639,XXV,"Then she would wring her hands, but soon again"
3640,XXV,Love's patience glimmered out through cloudy pain.      480
3641,XXV,
3642,XXV,
3643,XXVI,XXVI
3644,XXVI,
3645,XXVI,"Meanwhile he dared, not go and steal away"
3646,XXVI,"The silent, dead-cold witness of his sin;"
3647,XXVI,"He had not feared the life, but that dull clay,"
3648,XXVI,"Those open eyes that showed the death within,"
3649,XXVI,Would surely stare him mad; yet all the day
3650,XXVI,"A dreadful impulse, whence his will could win"
3651,XXVI,"No refuge, made him linger in the aisle,"
3652,XXVI,Freezing with his wan look each greeting smile.
3653,XXVI,
3654,XXVI,
3655,XXVII,XXVII
3656,XXVII,
3657,XXVII,"Now, on the second day there was to be"
3658,XXVII,A festival in church: from far and near      490
3659,XXVII,"Came flocking in the sunburnt peasantry,"
3660,XXVII,"And knights and dames with stately antique cheer,"
3661,XXVII,"Blazing with pomp, as if all faerie"
3662,XXVII,"Had emptied her quaint halls, or, as it were,"
3663,XXVII,"The illuminated marge of some old book,"
3664,XXVII,"While we were gazing, life and motion took."
3665,XXVII,
3666,XXVII,
3667,XXVIII,XXVIII
3668,XXVIII,
3669,XXVIII,"When all were entered, and the roving eyes"
3670,XXVIII,"Of all were stayed, some upon faces bright,"
3671,XXVIII,"Some on the priests, some on the traceries"
3672,XXVIII,"That decked the slumber of a marble knight,      500"
3673,XXVIII,And all the rustlings over that arise
3674,XXVIII,"From recognizing tokens of delight,"
3675,XXVIII,"When friendly glances meet,--then silent ease"
3676,XXVIII,Spread o'er the multitude by slow degrees.
3677,XXVIII,
3678,XXVIII,
3679,XXIX,XXIX
3680,XXIX,
3681,XXIX,Then swelled the organ: up through choir and nave
3682,XXIX,The music trembled with an inward thrill
3683,XXIX,Of bliss at its own grandeur; wave on wave
3684,XXIX,"Its flood of mellow thunder rose, until"
3685,XXIX,"The hushed air shivered with the throb it gave,"
3686,XXIX,"Then, poising for a moment, it stood still,      510"
3687,XXIX,"And sank and rose again, to burst in spray"
3688,XXIX,That wandered into silence far away.
3689,XXIX,
3690,XXIX,
3691,XXX,XXX
3692,XXX,
3693,XXX,"Like to a mighty heart the music seemed,"
3694,XXX,"That yearns with melodies it cannot speak,"
3695,XXX,"Until, in grand despair of what it dreamed,"
3696,XXX,"In the agony of effort it doth break,"
3697,XXX,Yet triumphs breaking; on it rushed and streamed
3698,XXX,"And wantoned in its might, as when a lake,"
3699,XXX,"Long pent among the mountains, bursts its walls"
3700,XXX,And in one crowding gash leaps forth and falls.      520
3701,XXX,
3702,XXX,
3703,XXXI,XXXI
3704,XXXI,
3705,XXXI,"Deeper and deeper shudders shook the air,"
3706,XXXI,"As the huge bass kept gathering heavily,"
3707,XXXI,"Like thunder when it rouses in its lair,"
3708,XXXI,"And with its hoarse growl shakes the low-hung sky,"
3709,XXXI,"It grew up like a darkness everywhere,"
3710,XXXI,"Filling the vast cathedral;--suddenly,"
3711,XXXI,From the dense mass a boy's clear treble broke
3712,XXXI,"Like lightning, and the full-toned choir awoke."
3713,XXXI,
3714,XXXI,
3715,XXXII,XXXII
3716,XXXII,
3717,XXXII,"Through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant,"
3718,XXXII,"Brimming the church with gold and purple mist,      530"
3719,XXXII,Meet atmosphere to bosom that rich chant.
3720,XXXII,Where fifty voices in one strand did twist
3721,XXXII,"Their varicolored tones, and left no want"
3722,XXXII,"To the delighted soul, which sank abyssed"
3723,XXXII,"In the warm music cloud, while, far below,"
3724,XXXII,The organ heaved its surges to and fro.
3725,XXXII,
3726,XXXII,
3727,XXXIII,XXXIII
3728,XXXIII,
3729,XXXIII,As if a lark should suddenly drop dead
3730,XXXIII,"While the blue air yet trembled with its song,"
3731,XXXIII,"So snapped at once that music's golden thread,"
3732,XXXIII,Struck by a nameless fear that leapt along      540
3733,XXXIII,"From heart to heart, and like a shadow spread"
3734,XXXIII,"With instantaneous shiver through the throng,"
3735,XXXIII,"So that some glanced behind, as half aware"
3736,XXXIII,A hideous shape of dread were standing there.
3737,XXXIII,
3738,XXXIII,
3739,XXXIV,XXXIV
3740,XXXIV,
3741,XXXIV,"As when a crowd of pale men gather round,"
3742,XXXIV,"Watching an eddy in the leaden deep,"
3743,XXXIV,From which they deem the body of one drowned
3744,XXXIV,"Will be cast forth, from face to face doth creep"
3745,XXXIV,An eager dread that holds all tongues fast bound
3746,XXXIV,"Until the horror, with a ghastly leap,      550"
3747,XXXIV,"Starts up, its dead blue arms stretched aimlessly,"
3748,XXXIV,"Heaved with the swinging of the careless sea,--"
3749,XXXIV,
3750,XXXIV,
3751,XXXV,XXXV
3752,XXXV,
3753,XXXV,"So in the faces of all these there grew,"
3754,XXXV,"As by one impulse, a dark, freezing awe,"
3755,XXXV,Which with a fearful fascination drew
3756,XXXV,All eyes toward the altar; damp and raw
3757,XXXV,"The air grew suddenly, and no man knew"
3758,XXXV,Whether perchance his silent neighbor saw
3759,XXXV,The dreadful thing which all were sure would rise
3760,XXXV,To scare the strained lids wider from their eyes.      560
3761,XXXV,
3762,XXXV,
3763,XXXVI,XXXVI
3764,XXXVI,
3765,XXXVI,The incense trembled as it upward sent
3766,XXXVI,"Its slow, uncertain thread of wandering blue,"
3767,XXXVI,As't were the only living element
3768,XXXVI,"In all the church, so deep the stillness grew;"
3769,XXXVI,"It seemed one might have heard it, as it went,"
3770,XXXVI,"Give out an audible rustle, curling through"
3771,XXXVI,"The midnight silence of that awestruck air,"
3772,XXXVI,"More hushed than death, though so much life was there."
3773,XXXVI,
3774,XXXVI,
3775,XXXVII,XXXVII
3776,XXXVII,
3777,XXXVII,"Nothing they saw, but a low voice was heard"
3778,XXXVII,"Threading the ominous silence of that fear,      570"
3779,XXXVII,"Gentle and terrorless as if a bird,"
3780,XXXVII,"Wakened by some volcano's glare, should cheer"
3781,XXXVII,The murk air with his song; yet every word
3782,XXXVII,"In the cathedral's farthest arch seemed near,"
3783,XXXVII,"As if it spoke to every one apart,"
3784,XXXVII,Like the clear voice of conscience in each heart.

3897,PROMETHEUS,
3898,PROMETHEUS,"One after one the stars have risen and set,"
3899,PROMETHEUS,Sparkling upon the hoarfrost on my chain:
3900,PROMETHEUS,"The Bear, that prowled all night about the fold"
3901,PROMETHEUS,"Of the North-star, hath shrunk into his den."
3902,PROMETHEUS,"Scared by the blithesome footsteps of the Dawn,"
3903,PROMETHEUS,Whose blushing smile floods all the Orient;
3904,PROMETHEUS,"And now bright Lucifer grows less and less,"
3905,PROMETHEUS,Into the heaven's blue quiet deep-withdrawn.
3906,PROMETHEUS,"Sunless and starless all, the desert sky"
3907,PROMETHEUS,"Arches above me, empty as this heart      10"
3908,PROMETHEUS,"For ages hath been empty of all joy,"
3909,PROMETHEUS,"Except to brood upon its silent hope,"
3910,PROMETHEUS,As o'er its hope of day the sky doth now.
3911,PROMETHEUS,All night have I heard voices: deeper yet
3912,PROMETHEUS,"The deep low breathing of the silence grew,"
3913,PROMETHEUS,"While all about, muffled in awe, there stood"
3914,PROMETHEUS,"Shadows, or forms, or both, clear-felt at heart,"
3915,PROMETHEUS,"But, when I turned to front them, far along"
3916,PROMETHEUS,"Only a shudder through the midnight ran,"
3917,PROMETHEUS,And the dense stillness walled me closer round.      20
3918,PROMETHEUS,But still I heard them wander up and down
3919,PROMETHEUS,"That solitude, and flappings of dusk wings"
3920,PROMETHEUS,"Did mingle with them, whether of those hags"
3921,PROMETHEUS,"Let slip upon me once from Hades deep,"
3922,PROMETHEUS,"Or of yet direr torments, if such be,"
3923,PROMETHEUS,I could but guess; and then toward me came
3924,PROMETHEUS,A shape as of a woman: very pale
3925,PROMETHEUS,"It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move,"
3926,PROMETHEUS,"And mine moved not, but only stared on them."
3927,PROMETHEUS,Their fixed awe went through my brain like ice;      30
3928,PROMETHEUS,"A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart,"
3929,PROMETHEUS,"And a sharp chill, as if a dank night fog"
3930,PROMETHEUS,"Suddenly closed me in, was all I felt:"
3931,PROMETHEUS,"And then, methought, I heard a freezing sigh,"
3932,PROMETHEUS,"A long, deep, shivering sigh, as from blue lips"
3933,PROMETHEUS,"Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought"
3934,PROMETHEUS,"Some doom was close upon me, and I looked"
3935,PROMETHEUS,"And saw the red moon through the heavy mist,"
3936,PROMETHEUS,"Just setting, and it seemed as it were falling,"
3937,PROMETHEUS,"Or reeling to its fall, so dim and dead      40"
3938,PROMETHEUS,And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged
3939,PROMETHEUS,"Into the rising surges of the pines,"
3940,PROMETHEUS,"Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins"
3941,PROMETHEUS,"Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength,"
3942,PROMETHEUS,"Sent up a murmur in the morning wind,"
3943,PROMETHEUS,Sad as the wail that from the populous earth
3944,PROMETHEUS,All day and night to high Olympus soars.
3945,PROMETHEUS,"Fit incense to thy wicked throne, O Jove!"
3946,PROMETHEUS,
3947,PROMETHEUS,Thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn
3948,PROMETHEUS,"From off my lips, for I will tell thy doom.      50"
3949,PROMETHEUS,"And are these tears? Nay, do not triumph, Jove!"
3950,PROMETHEUS,They are wrung from me but by the agonies
3951,PROMETHEUS,"Of prophecy, like those sparse drops which fall"
3952,PROMETHEUS,"From clouds in travail of the lightning, when"
3953,PROMETHEUS,The great wave of the storm high-curled and black
3954,PROMETHEUS,Rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break.
3955,PROMETHEUS,"Why art thou made a god of, thou poor type"
3956,PROMETHEUS,"Of anger, and revenge, and cunning force?"
3957,PROMETHEUS,"True Power was never born of brutish Strength,"
3958,PROMETHEUS,Nor sweet Truth suckled at the shaggy dugs      60
3959,PROMETHEUS,"Of that old she-wolf. Are thy thunderbolts,"
3960,PROMETHEUS,"That quell the darkness for a space, so strong"
3961,PROMETHEUS,"As the prevailing patience of meek Light,"
3962,PROMETHEUS,"Who, with the invincible tenderness of peace,"
3963,PROMETHEUS,Wins it to be a portion of herself?
3964,PROMETHEUS,"Why art thou made a god of, thou, who hast"
3965,PROMETHEUS,"The never-sleeping terror at thy heart,"
3966,PROMETHEUS,"That birthright of all tyrants, worse to bear"
3967,PROMETHEUS,Than this thy ravening bird on which I smile?
3968,PROMETHEUS,"Thou swear'st to free me, if I will unfold      70"
3969,PROMETHEUS,What kind of doom it is whose omen flits
3970,PROMETHEUS,"Across thy heart, as o'er a troop of doves"
3971,PROMETHEUS,The fearful shadow of the kite. What need
3972,PROMETHEUS,To know that truth whose knowledge cannot save?
3973,PROMETHEUS,"Evil its errand hath, as well as Good;"
3974,PROMETHEUS,"When thine is finished, thou art known no more:"
3975,PROMETHEUS,"There is a higher purity than thou,"
3976,PROMETHEUS,And higher purity is greater strength;
3977,PROMETHEUS,"Thy nature is thy doom, at which thy heart"
3978,PROMETHEUS,Trembles behind the thick wall of thy might.     80
3979,PROMETHEUS,"Let man but hope, and thou art straightway chilled"
3980,PROMETHEUS,With thought of that drear silence and deep night
3981,PROMETHEUS,"Which, like a dream, shall swallow thee and thine:"
3982,PROMETHEUS,"Let man but will, and thou art god no more,"
3983,PROMETHEUS,More capable of ruin than the gold
3984,PROMETHEUS,And ivory that image thee on earth.
3985,PROMETHEUS,He who hurled down the monstrous Titan-brood
3986,PROMETHEUS,"Blinded with lightnings, with rough thunders stunned,"
3987,PROMETHEUS,Is weaker than a simple human thought.
3988,PROMETHEUS,"My slender voice can shake thee, as the breeze,      90"
3989,PROMETHEUS,"That seems but apt to stir a maiden's hair,"
3990,PROMETHEUS,Sways huge Oceanus from pole to pole;
3991,PROMETHEUS,"For I am still Prometheus, and foreknow"
3992,PROMETHEUS,In my wise heart the end and doom of all.
3993,PROMETHEUS,
3994,PROMETHEUS,"Yes, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown"
3995,PROMETHEUS,"By years of solitude,--that holds apart"
3996,PROMETHEUS,"The past and future, giving the soul room"
3997,PROMETHEUS,"To search into itself,--and long commune"
3998,PROMETHEUS,"With this eternal silence;--more a god,"
3999,PROMETHEUS,In my long-suffering and strength to meet      100
4000,PROMETHEUS,"With equal front the direst shafts of fate,"
4001,PROMETHEUS,"Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism,"
4002,PROMETHEUS,Girt with thy baby-toys of force and wrath.
4003,PROMETHEUS,"Yes, I am that Prometheus who brought down"
4004,PROMETHEUS,"The light to man, which thou, in selfish fear,"
4005,PROMETHEUS,"Hadst to thy self usurped,--his by sole right,"
4006,PROMETHEUS,"For Man hath right to all save Tyranny,--"
4007,PROMETHEUS,And which shall free him yet from thy frail throne.
4008,PROMETHEUS,"Tyrants are but the spawn of Ignorance,"
4009,PROMETHEUS,"Begotten by the slaves they trample on,       110"
4010,PROMETHEUS,"Who, could they win a glimmer of the light,"
4011,PROMETHEUS,"And see that Tyranny is always weakness,"
4012,PROMETHEUS,"Or Fear with its own bosom ill at ease,"
4013,PROMETHEUS,Would laugh away in scorn the sand-wove chain
4014,PROMETHEUS,Which their own blindness feigned for adamant.
4015,PROMETHEUS,"Wrong ever builds on quicksands, but the Right"
4016,PROMETHEUS,To the firm centre lays its moveless base.
4017,PROMETHEUS,"The tyrant trembles, if the air but stir"
4018,PROMETHEUS,"The innocent ringlets of a child's free hair,"
4019,PROMETHEUS,"And crouches, when the thought of some great spirit,      120"
4020,PROMETHEUS,"With world-wide murmur, like a rising gale."
4021,PROMETHEUS,"Over men's hearts, as over standing corn,"
4022,PROMETHEUS,"Rushes, and bends them to its own strong will."
4023,PROMETHEUS,"So shall some thought of mine yet circle earth,"
4024,PROMETHEUS,"And puff away thy crumbling altars, Jove!"
4025,PROMETHEUS,
4026,PROMETHEUS,"And, wouldst thou know of my supreme revenge,"
4027,PROMETHEUS,"Poor tyrant, even now dethroned in heart,"
4028,PROMETHEUS,"Realmless in soul, as tyrants ever are,"
4029,PROMETHEUS,"Listen! and tell me if this bitter peak,"
4030,PROMETHEUS,"This never-glutted vulture, and these chains      130"
4031,PROMETHEUS,Shrink not before it; for it shall befit
4032,PROMETHEUS,"A sorrow-taught, unconquered Titan-heart."
4033,PROMETHEUS,"Men, when their death is on them, seem to stand"
4034,PROMETHEUS,On a precipitous crag that overhangs
4035,PROMETHEUS,"The abyss of doom, and in that depth to see,"
4036,PROMETHEUS,"As in a glass, the features dim and vast"
4037,PROMETHEUS,"Of things to come, the shadows, as it seems,"
4038,PROMETHEUS,Of what have been. Death ever fronts the wise;
4039,PROMETHEUS,"Not fearfully, but with clear promises"
4040,PROMETHEUS,"Of larger life, on whose broad vans upborne,      140"
4041,PROMETHEUS,"Their outlook widens, and they see beyond"
4042,PROMETHEUS,"The horizon of the Present and the Past,"
4043,PROMETHEUS,Even to the very source and end of things.
4044,PROMETHEUS,Such am I now: immortal woe hath made
4045,PROMETHEUS,"My heart a seer, and my soul a judge"
4046,PROMETHEUS,Between the substance and the shadow of Truth.
4047,PROMETHEUS,"The sure supremeness of the Beautiful,"
4048,PROMETHEUS,By all the martyrdoms made doubly sure
4049,PROMETHEUS,"Of such as I am, this is my revenge,"
4050,PROMETHEUS,"Which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch,      150"
4051,PROMETHEUS,Through which I see a sceptre and a throne.
4052,PROMETHEUS,"The pipings of glad shepherds on the hills,"
4053,PROMETHEUS,Tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee;
4054,PROMETHEUS,The songs of maidens pressing with white feet
4055,PROMETHEUS,The vintage on thine altars poured no more;
4056,PROMETHEUS,The murmurous bliss of lovers underneath
4057,PROMETHEUS,Dim grapevine bowers whose rosy bunches press
4058,PROMETHEUS,"Not half so closely their warm cheeks, unpaled"
4059,PROMETHEUS,By thoughts of thy brute lust; the hive-like hum
4060,PROMETHEUS,"Of peaceful commonwealths, where sunburnt Toil      160"
4061,PROMETHEUS,Reaps for itself the rich earth made its own
4062,PROMETHEUS,"By its own labor, lightened with glad hymns"
4063,PROMETHEUS,To an omnipotence which thy mad bolts
4064,PROMETHEUS,"Would cope with as a spark with the vast sea,--"
4065,PROMETHEUS,"Even the spirit of free love and peace,"
4066,PROMETHEUS,"Duty's sure recompense through life and death,--"
4067,PROMETHEUS,These are such harvests as all master-spirits
4068,PROMETHEUS,"Reap, haply not on earth, but reap no less"
4069,PROMETHEUS,Because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs;
4070,PROMETHEUS,These are the bloodless daggers wherewithal      170
4071,PROMETHEUS,"They stab fallen tyrants, this their high revenge:"
4072,PROMETHEUS,"For their best part of life on earth is when,"
4073,PROMETHEUS,"Long after death, prisoned and pent no more,"
4074,PROMETHEUS,"Their thoughts, their wild dreams even, have become"
4075,PROMETHEUS,Part of the necessary air men breathe:
4076,PROMETHEUS,"When, like the moon, herself behind a cloud,"
4077,PROMETHEUS,"They shed down light before us on life's sea,"
4078,PROMETHEUS,That cheers us to steer onward still in hope.
4079,PROMETHEUS,Earth with her twining memories ivies o'er
4080,PROMETHEUS,"Their holy sepulchres; the chainless sea,      180"
4081,PROMETHEUS,"In tempest or wide calm, repeats their thoughts;"
4082,PROMETHEUS,"The lightning and the thunder, all free things,"
4083,PROMETHEUS,Have legends of them for the ears of men.
4084,PROMETHEUS,"All other glories are as falling stars,"
4085,PROMETHEUS,But universal Nature watches theirs:
4086,PROMETHEUS,Such strength is won by love of humankind.
4087,PROMETHEUS,
4088,PROMETHEUS,"Not that I feel that hunger after fame,"
4089,PROMETHEUS,Which souls of a half-greatness are beset with;
4090,PROMETHEUS,But that the memory of noble deeds
4091,PROMETHEUS,"Cries shame upon the idle and the vile,      190"
4092,PROMETHEUS,And keeps the heart of Man forever up
4093,PROMETHEUS,To the heroic level of old time.
4094,PROMETHEUS,To be forgot at first is little pain
4095,PROMETHEUS,To a heart conscious of such high intent
4096,PROMETHEUS,As must be deathless on the lips of men;
4097,PROMETHEUS,"But, having been a name, to sink and be"
4098,PROMETHEUS,"A something which the world can do without,"
4099,PROMETHEUS,"Which, having been or not, would never change"
4100,PROMETHEUS,"The lightest pulse of fate,--this is indeed"
4101,PROMETHEUS,"A cup of bitterness the worst to taste,      200"
4102,PROMETHEUS,And this thy heart shall empty to the dregs.
4103,PROMETHEUS,"Endless despair shall be thy Caucasus,"
4104,PROMETHEUS,And memory thy vulture; thou wilt find
4105,PROMETHEUS,Oblivion far lonelier than this peak.
4106,PROMETHEUS,Behold thy destiny! Thou think'st it much
4107,PROMETHEUS,"That I should brave thee, miserable god!"
4108,PROMETHEUS,"But I have braved a mightier than thou,"
4109,PROMETHEUS,"Even the sharp tempting of this soaring heart,"
4110,PROMETHEUS,"Which might have made me, scarcely less than thou,"
4111,PROMETHEUS,"A god among my brethren weak and blind,      210"
4112,PROMETHEUS,"Scarce less than thou, a pitiable thing"
4113,PROMETHEUS,To be down-trodden into darkness soon.
4114,PROMETHEUS,"But now I am above thee, for thou art"
4115,PROMETHEUS,"The bungling workmanship of fear, the block"
4116,PROMETHEUS,That awes the swart Barbarian; but I
4117,PROMETHEUS,"Am what myself have made,--a nature wise"
4118,PROMETHEUS,"With finding in itself the types of all,"
4119,PROMETHEUS,With watching from the dim verge of the time
4120,PROMETHEUS,What things to be are visible in the gleams
4121,PROMETHEUS,"Thrown forward on them from the luminous past,     220"
4122,PROMETHEUS,"Wise with the history of its own frail heart,"
4123,PROMETHEUS,"With reverence and with sorrow, and with love,"
4124,PROMETHEUS,"Broad as the world, for freedom and for man."
4125,PROMETHEUS,
4126,PROMETHEUS,"Thou and all strength shall crumble, except Love,"
4127,PROMETHEUS,"By whom, and for whose glory, ye shall cease:"
4128,PROMETHEUS,"And, when thou'rt but a weary moaning heard"
4129,PROMETHEUS,"From out the pitiless gloom of Chaos, I"
4130,PROMETHEUS,"Shall be a power and a memory,"
4131,PROMETHEUS,"A name to fright all tyrants with, a light"
4132,PROMETHEUS,"Unsetting as the pole-star, a great voice     230"
4133,PROMETHEUS,Heard in the breathless pauses of the fight
4134,PROMETHEUS,"By truth and freedom ever waged with wrong,"
4135,PROMETHEUS,"Clear as a silver trumpet, to awake"
4136,PROMETHEUS,Far echoes that from age to age live on
4137,PROMETHEUS,"In kindred spirits, giving them a sense"
4138,PROMETHEUS,Of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung:
4139,PROMETHEUS,And many a glazing eye shall smile to see
4140,PROMETHEUS,The memory of my triumph (for to meet
4141,PROMETHEUS,"Wrong with endurance, and to overcome"
4142,PROMETHEUS,"The present with a heart that looks beyond,     240"
4143,PROMETHEUS,"Are triumph), like a prophet eagle, perch"
4144,PROMETHEUS,Upon the sacred banner of the Right.
4145,PROMETHEUS,"Evil springs up, and flowers, and bears no seed,"
4146,PROMETHEUS,"And feeds the green earth with its swift decay,"
4147,PROMETHEUS,Leaving it richer for the growth of truth;
4148,PROMETHEUS,"But Good, once put in action or in thought,"
4149,PROMETHEUS,"Like a strong oak, doth from its boughs shed down"
4150,PROMETHEUS,"The ripe germs of a forest. Thou, weak god,"
4151,PROMETHEUS,"Shalt fade and be forgotten! but this soul,"
4152,PROMETHEUS,"Fresh-living still in the serene abyss,     250"
4153,PROMETHEUS,"In every heaving shall partake, that grows"
4154,PROMETHEUS,"From heart to heart among the sons of men,--"
4155,PROMETHEUS,As the ominous hum before the earthquake runs
4156,PROMETHEUS,"Far through the Ægean from roused isle to isle,--"
4157,PROMETHEUS,"Foreboding wreck to palaces and shrines,"
4158,PROMETHEUS,And mighty rents in many a cavernous error
4159,PROMETHEUS,"That darkens the free light to man:--This heart,"
4160,PROMETHEUS,"Unscarred by thy grim vulture, as the truth"
4161,PROMETHEUS,Grows but more lovely 'neath the beaks and claws
4162,PROMETHEUS,"Of Harpies blind that fain would soil it, shall     260"
4163,PROMETHEUS,"In all the throbbing exultations, share"
4164,PROMETHEUS,"That wait on freedom's triumphs, and in all"
4165,PROMETHEUS,"The glorious agonies of martyr-spirits,"
4166,PROMETHEUS,Sharp lightning-throes to split the jagged clouds
4167,PROMETHEUS,"That veil the future, snowing them the end,"
4168,PROMETHEUS,"Pain's thorny crown for constancy and truth,"
4169,PROMETHEUS,Girding the temples like a wreath of stars.
4170,PROMETHEUS,"This is a thought, that, like the fabled laurel,"
4171,PROMETHEUS,Makes my faith thunder-proof; and thy dread bolts
4172,PROMETHEUS,Fall on me like the silent flakes of snow     270
4173,PROMETHEUS,On the hoar brows of aged Caucasus:
4174,PROMETHEUS,"But, oh, thought far more blissful, they can rend"
4175,PROMETHEUS,"This cloud of flesh, and make my soul a star!"
4176,PROMETHEUS,
4177,PROMETHEUS,"Unleash thy crouching thunders now, O Jove!"
4178,PROMETHEUS,"Free this high heart, which, a poor captive long,"
4179,PROMETHEUS,"Doth knock to be let forth, this heart which still,"
4180,PROMETHEUS,"In its invincible manhood, overtops"
4181,PROMETHEUS,"Thy puny godship, as this mountain doth"
4182,PROMETHEUS,"The pines that moss its roots. Oh, even now,"
4183,PROMETHEUS,"While from my peak of suffering I look down,     280"
4184,PROMETHEUS,Beholding with a far-spread gush of hope
4185,PROMETHEUS,"The sunrise of that Beauty, in whose face,"
4186,PROMETHEUS,"Shone all around with love, no man shall look"
4187,PROMETHEUS,But straightway like a god he be uplift
4188,PROMETHEUS,"Unto the throne long empty for his sake,"
4189,PROMETHEUS,And clearly oft foreshadowed in brave dreams
4190,PROMETHEUS,"By his free inward nature, which nor thou,"
4191,PROMETHEUS,"Nor any anarch after thee, can bind"
4192,PROMETHEUS,"From working its great doom,--now, now set free"
4193,PROMETHEUS,"This essence, not to die, but to become     290"
4194,PROMETHEUS,Part of that awful Presence which doth haunt
4195,PROMETHEUS,"The palaces of tyrants, to scare off,"
4196,PROMETHEUS,With its grim eyes and fearful whisperings
4197,PROMETHEUS,"And hideous sense of utter loneliness,"
4198,PROMETHEUS,"All hope of safety, all desire of peace,"
4199,PROMETHEUS,"All but the loathed forefeeling of blank death,--"
4200,PROMETHEUS,Part of that spirit which doth ever brood
4201,PROMETHEUS,In patient calm on the unpilfered nest
4202,PROMETHEUS,"Of man's deep heart, till mighty thoughts grow fledged"
4203,PROMETHEUS,"To sail with darkening shadow o'er the world,     300"
4204,PROMETHEUS,Filling with dread such souls as dare not trust
4205,PROMETHEUS,"In the unfailing energy of Good,"
4206,PROMETHEUS,"Until they swoop, and their pale quarry make"
4207,PROMETHEUS,"Of some o'erbloated wrong,--that spirit which"
4208,PROMETHEUS,"Scatters great hopes in the seed-field of man,"
4209,PROMETHEUS,"Like acorns among grain, to grow and be"
4210,PROMETHEUS,A roof for freedom in all coming time!
4211,PROMETHEUS,
4212,PROMETHEUS,"But no, this cannot be; for ages yet,"
4213,PROMETHEUS,"In solitude unbroken, shall I hear"
4214,PROMETHEUS,"The angry Caspian to the Euxine shout,     310"
4215,PROMETHEUS,"And Euxine answer with a muffled roar,"
4216,PROMETHEUS,On either side storming the giant walls
4217,PROMETHEUS,Of Caucasus with leagues of climbing foam
4218,PROMETHEUS,"(Less, from my height, than flakes of downy snow),"
4219,PROMETHEUS,"That draw back baffled but to hurl again,"
4220,PROMETHEUS,"Snatched up in wrath and horrible turmoil,"
4221,PROMETHEUS,"Mountain on mountain, as the Titans erst,"
4222,PROMETHEUS,"My brethren, scaling the high seat of Jove,"
4223,PROMETHEUS,Heaved Pelion upon Ossa's shoulders broad
4224,PROMETHEUS,In vain emprise. The moon will come and go     320
4225,PROMETHEUS,With her monotonous vicissitude;
4226,PROMETHEUS,"Once beautiful, when I was free to walk"
4227,PROMETHEUS,"Among my fellows, and to interchange"
4228,PROMETHEUS,"The influence benign of loving eyes,"
4229,PROMETHEUS,But now by aged use grows wearisome;--
4230,PROMETHEUS,False thought! most false! for how could I endure
4231,PROMETHEUS,These crawling centuries of lonely woe
4232,PROMETHEUS,"Unshamed by weak complaining, but for thee,"
4233,PROMETHEUS,"Loneliest, save me, of all created things,"
4234,PROMETHEUS,"Mild-eyed Astarte, my best comforter,             330"
4235,PROMETHEUS,With thy pale smile of sad benignity?
4236,PROMETHEUS,
4237,PROMETHEUS,Year after year will pass away and seem
4238,PROMETHEUS,"To me, in mine eternal agony,"
4239,PROMETHEUS,"But as the shadows of dumb summer clouds,"
4240,PROMETHEUS,Which I have watched so often darkening o'er
4241,PROMETHEUS,"The vast Sarmatian plain, league-wide at first,"
4242,PROMETHEUS,"But, with still swiftness, lessening on and on"
4243,PROMETHEUS,Till cloud and shadow meet and mingle where
4244,PROMETHEUS,"The gray horizon fades into the sky,"
4245,PROMETHEUS,"Far, far to northward. Yes, for ages yet          340"
4246,PROMETHEUS,"Must I lie here upon my altar huge,"
4247,PROMETHEUS,"A sacrifice for man. Sorrow will be,"
4248,PROMETHEUS,"As it hath been, his portion; endless doom,"
4249,PROMETHEUS,While the immortal with the mortal linked
4250,PROMETHEUS,"Dreams of its wings and pines for what it dreams,"
4251,PROMETHEUS,With upward yearn unceasing. Better so:
4252,PROMETHEUS,"For wisdom is stern sorrow's patient child,"
4253,PROMETHEUS,"And empire over self, and all the deep"
4254,PROMETHEUS,Strong charities that make men seem like gods;
4255,PROMETHEUS,"And love, that makes them be gods, from her breasts 350"
4256,PROMETHEUS,Sucks in the milk that makes mankind one blood.
4257,PROMETHEUS,"Good never comes unmixed, or so it seems,"
4258,PROMETHEUS,"Having two faces, as some images"
4259,PROMETHEUS,"Are carved, of foolish gods; one face is ill;"
4260,PROMETHEUS,"But one heart lies beneath, and that is good,"
4261,PROMETHEUS,"As are all hearts, when we explore their depths."
4262,PROMETHEUS,"Therefore, great heart, bear up; thou art but type"
4263,PROMETHEUS,"Of what all lofty spirits endure, that fain"
4264,PROMETHEUS,Would win men back to strength and peace through love:
4265,PROMETHEUS,"Each hath his lonely peak, and on each heart       360"
4266,PROMETHEUS,"Envy, or scorn, or hatred, tears lifelong"
4267,PROMETHEUS,With vulture beak; yet the high soul is left;
4268,PROMETHEUS,"And faith, which is but hope grown wise, and love"
4269,PROMETHEUS,And patience which at last shall overcome.

4376,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,"Whose heart was made of manly, simple stuff,"
4377,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,As homespun as their own.
4378,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,

4524,RHOECUS,
4525,RHOECUS,"A youth named Rhoecus, wandering in the wood,"
4526,RHOECUS,"Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall,"
4527,RHOECUS,"And, feeling pity of so fair a tree,"
4528,RHOECUS,"He propped its gray trunk with admiring care,"
4529,RHOECUS,And with a thoughtless footstep loitered on.        40
4530,RHOECUS,"But, as he turned, he heard a voice behind"
4531,RHOECUS,"That murmured 'Rhoecus!' 'Twas as if the leaves,"
4532,RHOECUS,"Stirred by a passing breath, had murmured it,"
4533,RHOECUS,"And, while he paused bewildered, yet again"
4534,RHOECUS,It murmured 'Rhoecus!' softer than a breeze.
4535,RHOECUS,He started and beheld with dizzy eyes
4536,RHOECUS,What seemed the substance of a happy dream
4537,RHOECUS,"Stand there before him, spreading a warm glow"
4538,RHOECUS,Within the green glooms of the shadowy oak.
4539,RHOECUS,"It seemed a woman's shape, yet far too fair         50"
4540,RHOECUS,"To be a woman, and with eyes too meek"
4541,RHOECUS,For any that were wont to mate with gods.
4542,RHOECUS,"All naked like a goddess stood she there,"
4543,RHOECUS,And like a goddess all too beautiful
4544,RHOECUS,To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame.
4545,RHOECUS,"'Rhoecus, I am the Dryad of this tree,'"
4546,RHOECUS,"Thus she began, dropping her low-toned words"
4547,RHOECUS,"Serene, and full, and clear, as drops of dew,"
4548,RHOECUS,'And with it I am doomed to live and die;

4550,RHOECUS,Nor have I other bliss than simple life;
4551,RHOECUS,"Now ask me what thou wilt, that I can give,"
4552,RHOECUS,And with a thankful joy it shall be thine.'
4553,RHOECUS,
4554,RHOECUS,"Then Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart,"
4555,RHOECUS,"Yet by the prompting of such beauty bold,"
4556,RHOECUS,Answered: 'What is there that can satisfy
4557,RHOECUS,The endless craving of the soul but love?
4558,RHOECUS,"Give me thy love, or but the hope of that"
4559,RHOECUS,Which must be evermore my nature's goal.'
4560,RHOECUS,"After a little pause she said again,"
4561,RHOECUS,"But with a glimpse of sadness in her tone,     71"
4562,RHOECUS,"'I give it, Rhoecus, though a perilous gift;"
4563,RHOECUS,An hour before the sunset meet me here.'
4564,RHOECUS,And straightway there was nothing he could see
4565,RHOECUS,"But the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak,"
4566,RHOECUS,And not a sound came to his straining ears
4567,RHOECUS,"But the low trickling rustle of the leaves,"
4568,RHOECUS,And far away upon an emerald slope
4569,RHOECUS,The falter of an idle shepherd's pipe.
4570,RHOECUS,
4571,RHOECUS,"Now, in those days of simpleness and faith, 80"
4572,RHOECUS,Men did not think that happy things were dreams
4573,RHOECUS,Because they overstepped the narrow bourn
4574,RHOECUS,"Of likelihood, but reverently deemed"
4575,RHOECUS,Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful
4576,RHOECUS,To be the guerdon of a daring heart.
4577,RHOECUS,"So Rhoecus made no doubt that he was blest,"
4578,RHOECUS,And all along unto the city's gate
4579,RHOECUS,"Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked,"
4580,RHOECUS,"The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont,"
4581,RHOECUS,"And he could scarce believe he had not wings,     90"
4582,RHOECUS,Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins
4583,RHOECUS,"Instead of blood, so light he felt and strange."
4584,RHOECUS,
4585,RHOECUS,"Young Rhoecus had a faithful heart enough,"
4586,RHOECUS,"But one that in the present dwelt too much,"
4587,RHOECUS,"And, taking with blithe welcome whatsoe'er"
4588,RHOECUS,"Chance gave of joy, was wholly bound in that,"
4589,RHOECUS,"Like the contented peasant of a vale,"
4590,RHOECUS,"Deemed it the world, and never looked beyond."
4591,RHOECUS,"So, haply meeting in the afternoon"
4592,RHOECUS,"Some comrades who were playing at the dice,     100"
4593,RHOECUS,"He joined them, and forgot all else beside."
4594,RHOECUS,
4595,RHOECUS,"The dice were rattling at the merriest,"
4596,RHOECUS,"And Rhoecus, who had met but sorry luck,"
4597,RHOECUS,"Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw,"
4598,RHOECUS,When through the room there hummed a yellow bee
4599,RHOECUS,That buzzed about his ear with down-dropped legs
4600,RHOECUS,"As if to light. And Rhoecus laughed and said,"
4601,RHOECUS,"Feeling how red and flushed he was with loss,"
4602,RHOECUS,'By Venus! does he take me for a rose?'
4603,RHOECUS,"And brushed him off with rough, impatient hand.     110"
4604,RHOECUS,"But still the bee came back, and thrice again"
4605,RHOECUS,Rhoecus did beat him off with growing wrath.
4606,RHOECUS,"Then through the window flew the wounded bee,"
4607,RHOECUS,"And Rhoecus, tracking him with angry eyes,"
4608,RHOECUS,Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly
4609,RHOECUS,"Against the red disk of the setting sun,--"
4610,RHOECUS,"And instantly the blood sank from his heart,"
4611,RHOECUS,As if its very walls had caved away.
4612,RHOECUS,"Without a word he turned, and, rushing forth,"
4613,RHOECUS,"Ran madly through the city and the gate,     120"
4614,RHOECUS,"And o'er the plain, which now the wood's long shade,"
4615,RHOECUS,"By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim,"
4616,RHOECUS,Darkened wellnigh unto the city's wall.
4617,RHOECUS,
4618,RHOECUS,"Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree,"
4619,RHOECUS,"And, listening fearfully, he heard once more"
4620,RHOECUS,The low voice murmur 'Rhoecus!' close at hand:
4621,RHOECUS,"Whereat he looked around him, but could see"
4622,RHOECUS,Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.
4623,RHOECUS,"Then sighed the voice, 'O Rhoecus! nevermore"
4624,RHOECUS,"Shalt thou behold me or by day or night,     130"
4625,RHOECUS,"Me, who would fain have blessed thee with a love"
4626,RHOECUS,More ripe and bounteous than ever yet
4627,RHOECUS,Filled up with nectar any mortal heart:
4628,RHOECUS,"But thou didst scorn my humble messenger,"
4629,RHOECUS,"And sent'st him back to me with bruised wings,"
4630,RHOECUS,"We spirits only show to gentle eyes,"
4631,RHOECUS,"We ever ask an undivided love,"
4632,RHOECUS,And he who scorns the least of Nature's works
4633,RHOECUS,Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all.
4634,RHOECUS,Farewell! for thou canst never see me more.'     140
4635,RHOECUS,
4636,RHOECUS,"Then Rhoecus beat his breast, and groaned aloud,"
4637,RHOECUS,"And cried, 'Be pitiful! forgive me yet"
4638,RHOECUS,"This once, and I shall never need it more!'"
4639,RHOECUS,"'Alas!' the voice returned, 'tis thou art blind,"
4640,RHOECUS,"Not I unmerciful; I can forgive,"
4641,RHOECUS,But have no skill to heal thy spirit's eyes;
4642,RHOECUS,Only the soul hath power o'er itself.'
4643,RHOECUS,With that again there murmured 'Nevermore!'
4644,RHOECUS,"And Rhoecus after heard no other sound,"
4645,RHOECUS,"Except the rattling of the oak's crisp leaves,     150"
4646,RHOECUS,"Like the long surf upon a distant shore,"
4647,RHOECUS,Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down.
4648,RHOECUS,The night had gathered round him: o'er the plain
4649,RHOECUS,"The city sparkled with its thousand lights,"
4650,RHOECUS,And sounds of revel fell upon his ear
4651,RHOECUS,"Harshly and like a curse; above, the sky,"
4652,RHOECUS,"With all its bright sublimity of stars,"
4653,RHOECUS,"Deepened, and on his forehead smote the breeze:"
4654,RHOECUS,"Beauty was all around him and delight,"
4655,RHOECUS,But from that eve he was alone on earth.     160

4675,THE FALCON,
4676,THE FALCON,"No harmless dove, no bird that singeth,"
4677,THE FALCON,Shudders to see him overhead;

4679,THE FALCON,To innocent hearts no thrill of dread.
4680,THE FALCON,
4681,THE FALCON,"Let fraud and wrong and baseness shiver,"

4734,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,From one stage of our being to the next
4735,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"We pass unconscious o'er a slender bridge,"
4736,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"The momentary work of unseen hands,"

4743,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Which, for long ages in blank Chaos dumb,"

4749,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,And waiting but one ray of sunlight more

4766,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,The fate of England and of freedom once
4767,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,Seemed wavering in the heart of one plain man:

4770,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,In the eternal round from wisdom on     40
4771,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"To higher wisdom, had been made to pause"

4773,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"He knew not why, nor we, but only God,--"
4774,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,And lived to make his simple oaken chair
4775,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"More terrible and soberly august,"
4776,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"More full of majesty than any throne,"
4777,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Before or after, of a British king."

4788,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Care, not of self, but for the common-weal,"
4789,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Had robbed their eyes of youth, and left instead"
4790,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"A look of patient power and iron will,"
4791,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"And something fiercer, too, that gave broad hint       60"
4792,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,Of the plain weapons girded at their sides.
4793,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"The younger had an aspect of command,--"

4795,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"In the shrunk channel of a great descent,"
4796,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"But such as lies entowered in heart and head,"
4797,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,And an arm prompt to do the 'hests of both.
4798,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"His was a brow where gold were out of place,"

4801,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Of iron, or some serviceable stuff"
4802,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,That would have matched his brownly rugged face       71
4803,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"The elder, although such he hardly seemed"
4804,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"(Care makes so little of some five short years),"
4805,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Had a clear, honest face, whose rough-hewn strength"
4806,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,Was mildened by the scholar's wiser heart
4807,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"To sober courage, such as best befits"
4808,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"The unsullied temper of a well-taught mind,"
4809,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,Yet so remained that one could plainly guess
4810,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,The hushed volcano smouldering underneath.
4811,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"He spoke: the other, hearing, kept his gaze           80"
4812,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,"Still fixed, as on some problem in the sky."
4813,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,
4814,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,'O CROMWELL we are fallen on evil times!
4815,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,There was a day when England had a wide room

4833,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,With wide gray eyes still reading the blank air.
4834,A GLANCE BEHIND THE CURTAIN,As if upon the sky's blue wall he saw

5078,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,For the leading incidents in this tale I am indebted to the very
5079,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"valuable _Algic Researches_ of Henry R. Schoolcraft, Esq. J.R.L."
5080,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,
5081,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The old Chief, feeling now wellnigh his end,"
5082,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Called his two eldest children to his side,"
5083,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And gave them, in few words, his parting charge!"
5084,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'My son and daughter, me ye see no more;"
5085,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The happy hunting-grounds await me, green"
5086,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,With change of spring and summer through the year:
5087,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But, for remembrance, after I am gone,"
5088,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Be kind to little Sheemah for my sake:
5089,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Weakling he is and young, and knows not yet"
5090,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"To set the trap, or draw the seasoned bow;     10"
5091,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Therefore of both your loves he hath more need,"
5092,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And he, who needeth love, to love hath right;"
5093,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"It is not like our furs and stores of corn,"
5094,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Whereto we claim sole title by our toil,"
5095,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But the Great Spirit plants it in our hearts,"
5096,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And waters it, and gives it sun, to be"

5100,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,
5101,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Alone, beside a lake, their wigwam stood,     20"
5102,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Far from the other dwellings of their tribe:
5103,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, after many moons, the loneliness"
5104,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Wearied the elder brother, and he said,"
5105,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'Why should I dwell here far from men, shut out"
5106,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"From the free, natural joys that fit my age?"
5107,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Lo, I am tall and strong, well skilled to hunt,"
5108,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Patient of toil and hunger, and not yet"
5109,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Have seen the danger which I dared not look
5110,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Full in the face; what hinders me to be
5111,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,A mighty Brave and Chief among my kin?'         30
5112,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"So, taking up his arrows and his bow,"
5113,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"As if to hunt, he journeyed swiftly on,"
5114,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Until he gained the wigwams of his tribe,"
5115,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Where, choosing out a bride, he soon forgot,"
5116,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"In all the fret and bustle of new life,"
5117,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,The little Sheemah and his father's charge.
5118,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,
5119,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Now when the sister found her brother gone,"
5120,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And that, for many days, he came not back,"
5121,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,She wept for Sheemah more than for herself;
5122,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"For Love bides longest in a woman's heart,       40"
5123,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And flutters many times before he flies,"
5124,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And then doth perch so nearly, that a word"
5125,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,May lure him back to his accustomed nest;
5126,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And Duty lingers even when Love is gone,"
5127,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Oft looking out in hope of his return;
5128,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, after Duty hath been driven forth,"
5129,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Then Selfishness creeps in the last of all,"
5130,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth,"
5131,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And crouching o'er the embers, to shut out"
5132,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Whatever paltry warmth and light are left,      50"
5133,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"With avaricious greed, from all beside."
5134,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"So, for long months, the sister hunted wide,"
5135,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,And cared for little Sheemah tenderly;
5136,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But, daily more and more, the loneliness"
5137,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Grew wearisome, and to herself she sighed,"
5138,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'Am I not fair? at least the glassy pool,"
5139,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"That hath no cause to flatter, tells me so;"
5140,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But, oh, how flat and meaningless the tale,"
5141,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Unless it tremble on a lover's tongue!
5142,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Beauty hath no true glass, except it be        60"
5143,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,In the sweet privacy of loving eyes.'
5144,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Thus deemed she idly, and forgot the lore"
5145,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Which she had learned of nature and the woods,"
5146,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"That beauty's chief reward is to itself,"
5147,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,And that Love's mirror holds no image long
5148,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Save of the inward fairness, blurred and lost"
5149,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Unless kept clear and white by Duty's care.
5150,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"So she went forth and sought the haunts of men,"
5151,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, being wedded, in her household cares,"
5152,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Soon, like the elder brother, quite forgot     70"
5153,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,The little Sheemah and her father's charge.
5154,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,
5155,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But Sheemah, left alone within the lodge,"
5156,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Waited and waited, with a shrinking heart,"
5157,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Thinking each rustle was his sister's step,"
5158,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Till hope grew less and less, and then went out,"
5159,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,And every sound was changed from hope to fear.
5160,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Few sounds there were:--the dropping of a nut,"
5161,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The squirrel's chirrup, and the jay's harsh scream,"
5162,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Autumn's sad remnants of blithe Summer's cheer,"
5163,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Heard at long intervals, seemed but to make     80"
5164,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,The dreadful void of silence silenter.
5165,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Soon what small store his sister left was gone,"
5166,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, through the Autumn, he made shift to live"
5167,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"On roots and berries, gathered in much fear"
5168,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Of wolves, whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes,"
5169,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Hollow and hungry, at the dead of night."
5170,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"But Winter came at last, and, when the snow,"
5171,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Thick-heaped for gleaming leagues o'er hill and plain,"
5172,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Spread its unbroken silence over all,"
5173,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Made bold by hunger, he was fain to glean     90"
5174,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"(More sick at heart than Ruth, and all alone)"
5175,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"After the harvest of the merciless wolf,"
5176,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Grim Boaz, who, sharp-ribbed and gaunt, yet feared"
5177,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,A thing more wild and starving than himself;
5178,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Till, by degrees, the wolf and he grew friends,"
5179,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,And shared together all the winter through.
5180,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,
5181,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Late in the Spring, when all the ice was gone,"
5182,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The elder brother, fishing in the lake,"
5183,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Upon whose edge his father's wigwam stood,"
5184,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Heard a low moaning noise upon the shore:     100
5185,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Half like a child it seemed, half like a wolf,"
5186,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,And straightway there was something in his heart
5187,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"That said, 'It is thy brother Sheemah's voice.'"
5188,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"So, paddling swiftly to the bank, he saw,"
5189,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Within a little thicket close at hand,"
5190,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"A child that seemed fast clinging to a wolf,"
5191,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"From the neck downward, gray with shaggy hair,"
5192,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,That still crept on and upward as he looked.
5193,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The face was turned away, but well he knew"
5194,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"That it was Sheemah's, even his brother's face.     110"
5195,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes,"
5196,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And bowed his head, so that he might not see"
5197,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"The first look of his brother's eyes, and cried,"
5198,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'O Sheemah! O my brother, speak to me!"
5199,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Dost thou not know me, that I am thy brother?"
5200,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Come to me, little Sheemah, thou shall dwell"
5201,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"With me henceforth, and know no care or want!'"
5202,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Sheemah was silent for a space, as if"
5203,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'T were hard to summon up a human voice,"
5204,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, when he spake, the voice was as a wolf's:     120"
5205,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"'I know thee not, nor art thou what thou say'st;"
5206,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"I have none other brethren than the wolves,"
5207,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, till thy heart be changed from what it is,"
5208,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,Thou art not worthy to be called their kin.'
5209,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Then groaned the other, with a choking tongue,"
5210,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,'Alas! my heart is changed right bitterly;
5211,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,'Tis shrunk and parched within me even now!'
5212,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"And, looking upward fearfully, he saw"
5213,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Only a wolf that shrank away, and ran,"
5214,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND,"Ugly and fierce, to hide among the woods.      130"

5237,STANZAS ON FREEDOM,
5238,STANZAS ON FREEDOM,Is true Freedom but to break
5239,STANZAS ON FREEDOM,"Fetters for our own dear sake,"
5240,STANZAS ON FREEDOM,"And, with leathern hearts, forget"

5260,COLUMBUS,"The cordage creaks and rattles in the wind,"

5262,COLUMBUS,"Now thumps like solid rock beneath the stern,"
5263,COLUMBUS,"Now leaps with clumsy wrath, strikes short, and, falling"
5264,COLUMBUS,"Crumbled to whispery foam, slips rustling down"
5265,COLUMBUS,"The broad backs of the waves, which jostle and crowd"
5266,COLUMBUS,To fling themselves upon that unknown shore.
5267,COLUMBUS,"Their used familiar since the dawn of time,"
5268,COLUMBUS,Whither this foredoomed life is guided on
5269,COLUMBUS,"To sway on triumph's hushed, aspiring poise      10"
5270,COLUMBUS,"One glittering moment, then to break fulfilled."
5271,COLUMBUS,
5272,COLUMBUS,"How lonely is the sea's perpetual swing,"
5273,COLUMBUS,"The melancholy wash of endless waves,"
5274,COLUMBUS,"The sigh of some grim monster undescried,"
5275,COLUMBUS,"Fear-painted on the canvas of the dark,"
5276,COLUMBUS,Shifting on his uneasy pillow of brine!
5277,COLUMBUS,"Yet, night brings more companions than the day"
5278,COLUMBUS,"To this drear waste; new constellations burn,"
5279,COLUMBUS,"And fairer stars, with whose calm height my soul"
5280,COLUMBUS,Finds nearer sympathy than with my herd      20
5281,COLUMBUS,"Of earthen souls, whose vision's scanty ring"
5282,COLUMBUS,Makes me its prisoner to beat my wings
5283,COLUMBUS,"Against the cold bars of their unbelief,"
5284,COLUMBUS,Knowing in vain my own free heaven beyond.
5285,COLUMBUS,"O God! this world, so crammed with eager life,"
5286,COLUMBUS,That comes and goes and wanders back to silence
5287,COLUMBUS,"Like the idle wind, which yet man's shaping mind"
5288,COLUMBUS,Can make his drudge to swell the longing sails
5289,COLUMBUS,"Of highest endeavor,--this mad, unthrift world,"
5290,COLUMBUS,"Which, every hour, throws life enough away      30"
5291,COLUMBUS,"To make her deserts kind and hospitable,"
5292,COLUMBUS,Lets her great destinies be waved aside
5293,COLUMBUS,"By smooth, lip-reverent, formal infidels,"
5294,COLUMBUS,"Who weigh the God they not believe with gold,"
5295,COLUMBUS,"And find no spot in Judas, save that he,"
5296,COLUMBUS,"Driving a duller bargain than he ought,"
5297,COLUMBUS,Saddled his guild with too cheap precedent.
5298,COLUMBUS,"O Faith! if thou art strong, thine opposite"
5299,COLUMBUS,"Is mighty also, and the dull fool's sneer"
5300,COLUMBUS,Hath ofttimes shot chill palsy through the arm      40
5301,COLUMBUS,"Just lifted to achieve its crowning deed,"
5302,COLUMBUS,"And made the firm-based heart, that would have quailed"
5303,COLUMBUS,"The rack or fagot, shudder like a leaf"
5304,COLUMBUS,"Wrinkled with frost, and loose upon its stem,"
5305,COLUMBUS,"The wicked and the weak, by some dark law,"
5306,COLUMBUS,Have a strange power to shut and rivet down
5307,COLUMBUS,"Their own horizon round us, to unwing"
5308,COLUMBUS,"Our heaven-aspiring visions, and to blur"
5309,COLUMBUS,"With surly clouds the Future's gleaming peaks,"
5310,COLUMBUS,Far seen across the brine of thankless years.      50
5311,COLUMBUS,If the chosen soul could never be alone
5312,COLUMBUS,"In deep mid-silence, open-doored to God,"
5313,COLUMBUS,No greatness ever had been dreamed or done;
5314,COLUMBUS,Among dull hearts a prophet never grew;
5315,COLUMBUS,The nurse of full-grown souls is solitude.
5316,COLUMBUS,
5317,COLUMBUS,The old world is effete; there man with man
5318,COLUMBUS,"Jostles, and, in the brawl for means to live,"
5319,COLUMBUS,"Life is trod underfoot,--Life, the one block"
5320,COLUMBUS,Of marble that's vouchsafed wherefrom to carve
5321,COLUMBUS,"Our great thoughts, white and godlike, to shine down      60"
5322,COLUMBUS,"The future, Life, the irredeemable block,"
5323,COLUMBUS,"Which one o'er-hasty chisel-dint oft mars,"
5324,COLUMBUS,Scanting our room to cut the features out
5325,COLUMBUS,"Of our full hope, so forcing us to crown"
5326,COLUMBUS,"With a mean head the perfect limbs, or leave"
5327,COLUMBUS,"The god's face glowing o'er a satyr's trunk,"
5328,COLUMBUS,Failure's brief epitaph.
5329,COLUMBUS,
5330,COLUMBUS,"Yes, Europe's world"
5331,COLUMBUS,"Reels on to judgment; there the common need,"
5332,COLUMBUS,"Losing God's sacred use, to be a bond"
5333,COLUMBUS,"'Twixt Me and Thee, sets each one scowlingly      70"
5334,COLUMBUS,"O'er his own selfish hoard at bay; no state,"
5335,COLUMBUS,Knit strongly with eternal fibres up
5336,COLUMBUS,"Of all men's separate and united weals,"
5337,COLUMBUS,"Self-poised and sole as stars, yet one as light,"
5338,COLUMBUS,Holds up a shape of large Humanity
5339,COLUMBUS,To which by natural instinct every man
5340,COLUMBUS,"Pays loyalty exulting, by which all"
5341,COLUMBUS,"Mould their own lives, and feel their pulses filled"
5342,COLUMBUS,"With the red, fiery blood of the general life,"
5343,COLUMBUS,"Making them mighty in peace, as now in war      80"
5344,COLUMBUS,"They are, even in the flush of victory, weak,"
5345,COLUMBUS,Conquering that manhood which should them subdue.
5346,COLUMBUS,And what gift bring I to this untried world?
5347,COLUMBUS,"Shall the same tragedy be played anew,"
5348,COLUMBUS,And the same lurid curtain drop at last
5349,COLUMBUS,"On one dread desolation, one fierce crash"
5350,COLUMBUS,Of that recoil which on its makers God
5351,COLUMBUS,"Lets Ignorance and Sin and Hunger make,"
5352,COLUMBUS,Early or late? Or shall that commonwealth
5353,COLUMBUS,Whose potent unity and concentric force      90
5354,COLUMBUS,Can draw these scattered joints and parts of men
5355,COLUMBUS,"Into a whole ideal man once more,"
5356,COLUMBUS,"Which sucks not from its limbs the life away,"
5357,COLUMBUS,But sends it flood-tide and creates itself
5358,COLUMBUS,"Over again in every citizen,"
5359,COLUMBUS,"Be there built up? For me, I have no choice;"
5360,COLUMBUS,"I might turn back to other destinies,"
5361,COLUMBUS,For one sincere key opes all Fortune's doors;
5362,COLUMBUS,But whoso answers not God's earliest call
5363,COLUMBUS,Forfeits or dulls that faculty supreme     100
5364,COLUMBUS,Of lying open to his genius
5365,COLUMBUS,Which makes the wise heart certain of its ends.
5366,COLUMBUS,
5367,COLUMBUS,"Here am I; for what end God knows, not I;"
5368,COLUMBUS,Westward still points the inexorable soul:
5369,COLUMBUS,"Here am I, with no friend but the sad sea,"
5370,COLUMBUS,"The beating heart of this great enterprise,"
5371,COLUMBUS,"Which, without me, would stiffen in swift death;"
5372,COLUMBUS,"This have I mused on, since mine eye could first"
5373,COLUMBUS,Among the stars distinguish and with joy
5374,COLUMBUS,"Rest on that God-fed Pharos of the north,      110"
5375,COLUMBUS,On some blue promontory of heaven lighted
5376,COLUMBUS,That juts far out into the upper sea;
5377,COLUMBUS,"To this one hope my heart hath clung for years,"
5378,COLUMBUS,As would a foundling to the talisman
5379,COLUMBUS,Hung round his neck by hands he knew not whose;
5380,COLUMBUS,"A poor, vile thing and dross to all beside,"
5381,COLUMBUS,Yet he therein can feel a virtue left
5382,COLUMBUS,"By the sad pressure of a mother's hand,"
5383,COLUMBUS,And unto him it still is tremulous
5384,COLUMBUS,"With palpitating haste and wet with tears,      120"
5385,COLUMBUS,"The key to him of hope and humanness,"
5386,COLUMBUS,"The coarse shell of life's pearl, Expectancy."
5387,COLUMBUS,"This hope hath been to me for love and fame,"
5388,COLUMBUS,"Hath made me wholly lonely on the earth,"
5389,COLUMBUS,"Building me up as in a thick-ribbed tower,"
5390,COLUMBUS,"Wherewith enwalled my watching spirit burned,"
5391,COLUMBUS,"Conquering its little island from the Dark,"
5392,COLUMBUS,"Sole as a scholar's lamp, and heard men's steps,"
5393,COLUMBUS,"In the far hurry of the outward world,"
5394,COLUMBUS,"Pass dimly forth and back, sounds heard in dream,      130"
5395,COLUMBUS,As Ganymede by the eagle was snatched up
5396,COLUMBUS,"From the gross sod to be Jove's cup-bearer,"
5397,COLUMBUS,So was I lifted by my great design:
5398,COLUMBUS,"And who hath trod Olympus, from his eye"
5399,COLUMBUS,Fades not that broader outlook of the gods;
5400,COLUMBUS,"His life's low valleys overbrow earth's clouds,"
5401,COLUMBUS,And that Olympian spectre of the past
5402,COLUMBUS,"Looms towering up in sovereign memory,"
5403,COLUMBUS,Beckoning his soul from meaner heights of doom.
5404,COLUMBUS,"Had but the shadow of the Thunderer's bird,      140"
5405,COLUMBUS,"Flashing athwart my spirit, made of me"
5406,COLUMBUS,"A swift-betraying vision's Ganymede,"
5407,COLUMBUS,Yet to have greatly dreamed precludes low ends;
5408,COLUMBUS,"Great days have ever such a morning-red,"
5409,COLUMBUS,"On such a base great futures are built up,"
5410,COLUMBUS,"And aspiration, though not put in act,"
5411,COLUMBUS,"Comes back to ask its plighted troth again,"
5412,COLUMBUS,Still watches round its grave the unlaid ghost
5413,COLUMBUS,"Of a dead virtue, and makes other hopes,"
5414,COLUMBUS,"Save that implacable one, seem thin and bleak      150"
5415,COLUMBUS,"As shadows of bare trees upon the snow,"
5416,COLUMBUS,Bound freezing there by the unpitying moon.
5417,COLUMBUS,
5418,COLUMBUS,"While other youths perplexed their mandolins,"
5419,COLUMBUS,Praying that Thetis would her fingers twine
5420,COLUMBUS,"In the loose glories of her lover's hair,"
5421,COLUMBUS,"And wile another kiss to keep back day,"
5422,COLUMBUS,"I, stretched beneath the many-centuried shade"
5423,COLUMBUS,"Of some writhed oak, the wood's Laocoön,"
5424,COLUMBUS,"Did of my hope a dryad mistress make,"
5425,COLUMBUS,"Whom I would woo to meet me privily,      160"
5426,COLUMBUS,"Or underneath the stars, or when the moon"
5427,COLUMBUS,Flecked all the forest floor with scattered pearls.
5428,COLUMBUS,O days whose memory tames to fawning down
5429,COLUMBUS,The surly fell of Ocean's bristled neck!
5430,COLUMBUS,
5431,COLUMBUS,"I know not when this hope enthralled me first,"
5432,COLUMBUS,But from my boyhood up I loved to hear
5433,COLUMBUS,The tall pine-forests of the Apennine
5434,COLUMBUS,"Murmur their hoary legends of the sea,"
5435,COLUMBUS,"Which hearing, I in vision clear beheld"
5436,COLUMBUS,The sudden dark of tropic night shut down      170
5437,COLUMBUS,"O'er the huge whisper of great watery wastes,"
5438,COLUMBUS,The while a pair of herons trailingly
5439,COLUMBUS,"Flapped inland, where some league-wide river hurled"
5440,COLUMBUS,The yellow spoil of unconjectured realms
5441,COLUMBUS,"Far through a gulf's green silence, never scarred,"
5442,COLUMBUS,By any but the Northwind's hurrying keels.
5443,COLUMBUS,And not the pines alone; all sights and sounds
5444,COLUMBUS,"To my world-seeking heart paid fealty,"
5445,COLUMBUS,And catered for it as the Cretan bees
5446,COLUMBUS,"Brought honey to the baby Jupiter,"
5447,COLUMBUS,"Who in his soft hand crushed a violet,     181"
5448,COLUMBUS,Godlike foremusing the rough thunder's gripe;
5449,COLUMBUS,"Then did I entertain the poet's song,"
5450,COLUMBUS,"My great Idea's guest, and, passing o'er"
5451,COLUMBUS,"That iron bridge the Tuscan built to hell,"
5452,COLUMBUS,I heard Ulysses tell of mountain-chains
5453,COLUMBUS,"Whose adamantine links, his manacles,"
5454,COLUMBUS,"The western main shook growling, and still gnawed."
5455,COLUMBUS,I brooded on the wise Athenian's tale.
5456,COLUMBUS,"Of happy Atlantis, and heard Björne's keel      190"
5457,COLUMBUS,Crunch the gray pebbles of the Vinland shore:
5458,COLUMBUS,"I listened, musing, to the prophecy"
5459,COLUMBUS,"Of Nero's tutor-victim; lo, the birds"
5460,COLUMBUS,"Sing darkling, conscious of the climbing dawn."
5461,COLUMBUS,And I believed the poets; it is they
5462,COLUMBUS,"Who utter wisdom from the central deep,"
5463,COLUMBUS,"And, listening to the inner flow of things,"
5464,COLUMBUS,Speak to the age out of eternity.
5465,COLUMBUS,
5466,COLUMBUS,Ah me! old hermits sought for solitude
5467,COLUMBUS,"In caves and desert places of the earth,      200"
5468,COLUMBUS,Where their own heart-beat was the only stir
5469,COLUMBUS,Of living thing that comforted the year;
5470,COLUMBUS,"But the bald pillar-top of Simeon,"
5471,COLUMBUS,"In midnight's blankest waste, were populous,"
5472,COLUMBUS,Matched with the isolation drear and deep
5473,COLUMBUS,"Of him who pines among the swarm of men,"
5474,COLUMBUS,"At once a new thought's king and prisoner,"
5475,COLUMBUS,"Feeling the truer life within his life,"
5476,COLUMBUS,"The fountain of his spirit's prophecy,"
5477,COLUMBUS,"Sinking away and wasting, drop by drop,      210"
5478,COLUMBUS,In the ungrateful sands of sceptic ears.
5479,COLUMBUS,He in the palace-aisles of untrod woods
5480,COLUMBUS,Doth walk a king; for him the pent-up cell
5481,COLUMBUS,"Widens beyond the circles of the stars,"
5482,COLUMBUS,And all the sceptred spirits of the past
5483,COLUMBUS,Come thronging in to greet him as their peer;
5484,COLUMBUS,But in the market-place's glare and throng
5485,COLUMBUS,"He sits apart, an exile, and his brow"
5486,COLUMBUS,Aches with the mocking memory of its crown.
5487,COLUMBUS,
5488,COLUMBUS,Yet to the spirit select there is no choice;      220
5489,COLUMBUS,"He cannot say, This will I do, or that,"
5490,COLUMBUS,"For the cheap means putting Heaven's ends in pawn,"
5491,COLUMBUS,"And bartering his bleak rocks, the freehold stern"
5492,COLUMBUS,"Of destiny's first-born, for smoother fields"
5493,COLUMBUS,That yield no crop of self-denying will;
5494,COLUMBUS,"A hand is stretched to him from out the dark,"
5495,COLUMBUS,"Which grasping without question, he is led"
5496,COLUMBUS,Where there is work that he must do for God.
5497,COLUMBUS,"The trial still is the strength's complement,"
5498,COLUMBUS,"And the uncertain, dizzy path that scales      230"
5499,COLUMBUS,The sheer heights of supremest purposes
5500,COLUMBUS,Is steeper to the angel than the child.
5501,COLUMBUS,"Chances have laws as fixed as planets have,"
5502,COLUMBUS,"And disappointment's dry and bitter root,"
5503,COLUMBUS,"Envy's harsh berries, and the choking pool"
5504,COLUMBUS,"Of the world's scorn, are the right mother-milk"
5505,COLUMBUS,"To the tough hearts that pioneer their kind,"
5506,COLUMBUS,And break a pathway to those unknown realms
5507,COLUMBUS,That in the earth's broad shadow lie enthralled;      239
5508,COLUMBUS,"Endurance is the crowning quality,"
5509,COLUMBUS,And patience all the passion of great hearts;
5510,COLUMBUS,"These are their stay, and when the leaden world"
5511,COLUMBUS,"Sets its hard face against their fateful thought,"
5512,COLUMBUS,"And brute strength, like the Gaulish conqueror,"
5513,COLUMBUS,"Clangs his huge glaive down in the other scale,"
5514,COLUMBUS,"The inspired soul but flings his patience in,"
5515,COLUMBUS,"And slowly that outweighs the ponderous globe,--"
5516,COLUMBUS,"One faith against a whole earth's unbelief,"
5517,COLUMBUS,One soul against the flesh of all mankind.
5518,COLUMBUS,
5519,COLUMBUS,Thus ever seems it when my soul can hear      250
5520,COLUMBUS,"The voice that errs not; then my triumph gleams,"
5521,COLUMBUS,"O'er the blank ocean beckoning, and all night"
5522,COLUMBUS,My heart flies on before me as I sail;
5523,COLUMBUS,Far on I see my lifelong enterprise.
5524,COLUMBUS,That rose like Ganges mid the freezing snows
5525,COLUMBUS,"Of a world's solitude, sweep broadening down,"
5526,COLUMBUS,"And, gathering to itself a thousand streams,"
5527,COLUMBUS,Grow sacred ere it mingle with the sea;
5528,COLUMBUS,"I see the ungated wall of chaos old,"
5529,COLUMBUS,"With blocks Cyclopean hewn of solid night,      260"
5530,COLUMBUS,Fade like a wreath of unreturning mist
5531,COLUMBUS,Before the irreversible feet of light;--
5532,COLUMBUS,"And lo, with what clear omen in the east"
5533,COLUMBUS,"On day's gray threshold stands the eager dawn,"
5534,COLUMBUS,Like young Leander rosy from the sea
5535,COLUMBUS,Glowing at Hero's lattice!
5536,COLUMBUS,
5537,COLUMBUS,One day more
5538,COLUMBUS,These muttering shoalbrains leave the helm to me:
5539,COLUMBUS,"God, let me not in their dull ooze be stranded:"
5540,COLUMBUS,"Let not this one frail bark, to hollow which"
5541,COLUMBUS,I have dug out the pith and sinewy heart      270
5542,COLUMBUS,"Of my aspiring life's fair trunk, be so"
5543,COLUMBUS,"Cast up to warp and blacken in the sun,"
5544,COLUMBUS,Just as the opposing wind 'gins whistle off
5545,COLUMBUS,"His cheek-swollen pack, and from the leaning mast"
5546,COLUMBUS,Fortune's full sail strains forward!
5547,COLUMBUS,
5548,COLUMBUS,One poor day!--
5549,COLUMBUS,Remember whose and not how short it is!
5550,COLUMBUS,"It is God's day, it is Columbus's."
5551,COLUMBUS,"A lavish day! One day, with life and heart,"
5552,COLUMBUS,Is more than time enough to find a world.

5594,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,Before the sacrilegious flood o'erleaped the churchyard wall;
5595,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"And, ere a _pater_ half was said, mid smoke and crackling glare,"
5596,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,His island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair.
5597,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,
5598,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,Upon the peril's desperate peak his heart stood up sublime;
5599,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"His first thought was for God above, his next was for his chime;"
5600,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"'Sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise,' cried he,"
5601,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"'As did the Israelites of old, safe walking through the sea!"
5602,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,
5603,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,'Through this red sea our God hath made the pathway safe to shore;
5604,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,Our promised land stands full in sight; shout now as ne'er before!
5605,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"And as the tower came crashing down, the bells, in clear accord,"
5606,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,"Pealed forth the grand old German hymn,--'All good souls, praise the"
5607,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG,Lord!'

5611,THE SOWER,THE SOWER
5612,THE SOWER,
5613,THE SOWER,I saw a Sower walking slow
5614,THE SOWER,"Across the earth, from east to west;"
5615,THE SOWER,"His hair was white as mountain snow,"
5616,THE SOWER,His head drooped forward on his breast.
5617,THE SOWER,
5618,THE SOWER,"With shrivelled hands he flung his seed,"
5619,THE SOWER,Nor ever turned to look behind;
5620,THE SOWER,Of sight or sound he took no heed;
5621,THE SOWER,"It seemed, he was both deaf and blind."
5622,THE SOWER,
5623,THE SOWER,"His dim face showed no soul beneath,"
5624,THE SOWER,"Yet in my heart I felt a stir,"
5625,THE SOWER,"As if I looked upon the sheath,"
5626,THE SOWER,That once had held Excalibur.
5627,THE SOWER,
5628,THE SOWER,"I heard, as still the seed he cast,"
5629,THE SOWER,"How, crooning to himself, he sung."
5630,THE SOWER,"'I sow again the holy Past,"
5631,THE SOWER,The happy days when I was young.
5632,THE SOWER,
5633,THE SOWER,"'Then all was wheat without a tare,"
5634,THE SOWER,"Then all was righteous, fair, and true;"
5635,THE SOWER,And I am he whose thoughtful care
5636,THE SOWER,Shall plant the Old World in the New.
5637,THE SOWER,
5638,THE SOWER,"'The fruitful germs I scatter free,"
5639,THE SOWER,"With busy hand, while all men sleep;"
5640,THE SOWER,"In Europe now, from sea to sea,"
5641,THE SOWER,The nations bless me as they reap.'
5642,THE SOWER,
5643,THE SOWER,Then I looked back along his path.
5644,THE SOWER,"And heard the clash of steel on steel,"
5645,THE SOWER,"Where man faced man, in deadly wrath,"
5646,THE SOWER,While clanged the tocsin's hurrying peal.
5647,THE SOWER,
5648,THE SOWER,"The sky with burning towns flared red,"
5649,THE SOWER,Nearer the noise of fighting rolled.
5650,THE SOWER,"And brothers' blood, by brothers shed,"
5651,THE SOWER,Crept curdling over pavements cold.
5652,THE SOWER,
5653,THE SOWER,Then marked I how each germ of truth
5654,THE SOWER,Which through the dotard's fingers ran
5655,THE SOWER,Was mated with a dragon's tooth
5656,THE SOWER,Whence there sprang up an armèd man.
5657,THE SOWER,
5658,THE SOWER,"I shouted, but he could not hear;"
5659,THE SOWER,"Made signs, but these he could not see;"
5660,THE SOWER,"And still, without a doubt or fear,"
5661,THE SOWER,Broadcast he scattered anarchy.
5662,THE SOWER,
5663,THE SOWER,Long to my straining ears the blast
5664,THE SOWER,Brought faintly back the words he sung:
5665,THE SOWER,"'I sow again the holy Past,"
5666,THE SOWER,The happy days when I was young.'
5667,THE SOWER,
5668,THE SOWER,

5702,HUNGER AND COLD,"Fashion strolled,"
5703,HUNGER AND COLD,I beheld with shuddering fear
5704,HUNGER AND COLD,Wolves' eyes through the windows peer;
5705,HUNGER AND COLD,"Little dream they you are near,"
5706,HUNGER AND COLD,Hunger and Cold!
5707,HUNGER AND COLD,
5708,HUNGER AND COLD,"When the toiler's heart you clutch,"
5709,HUNGER AND COLD,"Conscience is not valued much,"
5710,HUNGER AND COLD,He recks not a bloody smutch
5711,HUNGER AND COLD,On his gold:
5712,HUNGER AND COLD,"Everything to you defers,"
5713,HUNGER AND COLD,"You are potent reasoners,"
5714,HUNGER AND COLD,"At your whisper Treason stirs,"
5715,HUNGER AND COLD,Hunger and Cold!
5716,HUNGER AND COLD,
5717,HUNGER AND COLD,"Rude comparisons you draw,"
5718,HUNGER AND COLD,"Words refuse to sate your maw,"
5719,HUNGER AND COLD,Your gaunt limbs the cobweb law
5720,HUNGER AND COLD,Cannot hold:
5721,HUNGER AND COLD,"You're not clogged with foolish pride,"
5722,HUNGER AND COLD,But can seize a right denied:
5723,HUNGER AND COLD,"Somehow God is on your side,"
5724,HUNGER AND COLD,Hunger and Cold!
5725,HUNGER AND COLD,
5726,HUNGER AND COLD,You respect no hoary wrong
5727,HUNGER AND COLD,More for having triumphed long;
5728,HUNGER AND COLD,"Its past victims, haggard throng,"
5729,HUNGER AND COLD,From the mould
5730,HUNGER AND COLD,You unbury: swords and spears
5731,HUNGER AND COLD,"Weaker are than poor men's tears,"
5732,HUNGER AND COLD,"Weaker than your silent years,"
5733,HUNGER AND COLD,Hunger and Cold!
5734,HUNGER AND COLD,
5735,HUNGER AND COLD,Let them guard both hall and bower;
5736,HUNGER AND COLD,"Through the window you will glower,"

5982,TO THE PAST,Whatever of true life there was in thee      50
5983,TO THE PAST,Leaps in our age's veins;
5984,TO THE PAST,"Wield still thy bent and wrinkled empery,"
5985,TO THE PAST,And shake thine idle chains;--
5986,TO THE PAST,"To thee thy dross is clinging,"
5987,TO THE PAST,"For us thy martyrs die, thy prophets see,"
5988,TO THE PAST,Thy poets still are singing.
5989,TO THE PAST,
5990,TO THE PAST,"Here, mid the bleak waves of our strife and care,"
5991,TO THE PAST,Float the green Fortunate Isles
5992,TO THE PAST,"Where all thy hero-spirits dwell, and share"
5993,TO THE PAST,Our martyrdoms and toils;      60
5994,TO THE PAST,The present moves attended
5995,TO THE PAST,With all of brave and excellent and fair
5996,TO THE PAST,That made the old time splendid.

6001,TO THE FUTURE,
6002,TO THE FUTURE,O Land of Promise! from what Pisgah's height
6003,TO THE FUTURE,"Can I behold thy stretch of peaceful bowers,"
6004,TO THE FUTURE,"Thy golden harvests flowing out of sight,"
6005,TO THE FUTURE,Thy nestled homes and sun-illumined towers?
6006,TO THE FUTURE,"Gazing upon the sunset's high-heaped gold,"
6007,TO THE FUTURE,"Its crags of opal and of chrysolite,"
6008,TO THE FUTURE,"Its deeps on deeps of glory, that unfold"
6009,TO THE FUTURE,"Still brightening abysses,"
6010,TO THE FUTURE,"And blazing precipices,"
6011,TO THE FUTURE,"Whence but a scanty leap it seems to heaven,      10"
6012,TO THE FUTURE,Sometimes a glimpse is given
6013,TO THE FUTURE,"Of thy more gorgeous realm, thy more unstinted blisses."
6014,TO THE FUTURE,
6015,TO THE FUTURE,O Land of Quiet! to thy shore the surf
6016,TO THE FUTURE,Of the perturbèd Present rolls and sleeps;
6017,TO THE FUTURE,Our storms breathe soft as June upon thy turf
6018,TO THE FUTURE,"And lure out blossoms; to thy bosom leaps,"
6019,TO THE FUTURE,"As to a mother's, the o'erwearied heart,"
6020,TO THE FUTURE,"Hearing far off and dim the toiling mart,"
6021,TO THE FUTURE,"The hurrying feet, the curses without number,"
6022,TO THE FUTURE,"And, circled with the glow Elysian      20"
6023,TO THE FUTURE,"Of thine exulting vision,"
6024,TO THE FUTURE,Out of its very cares wooes charms for peace and slumber.
6025,TO THE FUTURE,
6026,TO THE FUTURE,To thee the earth lifts up her fettered hands
6027,TO THE FUTURE,And cries for vengeance; with a pitying smile
6028,TO THE FUTURE,"Thou blessest her, and she forgets her bands,"
6029,TO THE FUTURE,And her old woe-worn face a little while
6030,TO THE FUTURE,Grows young and noble; unto thee the Oppressor
6031,TO THE FUTURE,"Looks, and is dumb with awe;"
6032,TO THE FUTURE,"The eternal law,"
6033,TO THE FUTURE,"Which makes the crime its own blindfold redresser,      30"
6034,TO THE FUTURE,"Shadows his heart with perilous foreboding,"
6035,TO THE FUTURE,And he can see the grim-eyed Doom
6036,TO THE FUTURE,From out the trembling gloom
6037,TO THE FUTURE,Its silent-footed steeds towards his palace goading.
6038,TO THE FUTURE,
6039,TO THE FUTURE,"What promises hast thou for Poets' eyes,"
6040,TO THE FUTURE,A-weary of the turmoil and the wrong!
6041,TO THE FUTURE,To all their hopes what overjoyed replies!
6042,TO THE FUTURE,What undreamed ecstasies for blissful song!
6043,TO THE FUTURE,Thy happy plains no war-trump's brawling clangor
6044,TO THE FUTURE,"Disturbs, and fools the poor to hate the poor;      40"
6045,TO THE FUTURE,The humble glares not on the high with anger;
6046,TO THE FUTURE,"Love leaves no grudge at less, no greed for more;"
6047,TO THE FUTURE,In vain strives Self the godlike sense to smother;
6048,TO THE FUTURE,From the soul's deeps
6049,TO THE FUTURE,It throbs and leaps;
6050,TO THE FUTURE,The noble 'neath foul rags beholds his long-lost brother.
6051,TO THE FUTURE,
6052,TO THE FUTURE,"To thee the Martyr looketh, and his fires"
6053,TO THE FUTURE,Unlock their fangs and leave his spirit free;
6054,TO THE FUTURE,"To thee the Poet mid his toil aspires,"
6055,TO THE FUTURE,"And grief and hunger climb about his knee,      50"
6056,TO THE FUTURE,Welcome as children; thou upholdest
6057,TO THE FUTURE,The lone Inventor by his demon haunted;
6058,TO THE FUTURE,"The Prophet cries to thee when hearts are coldest,"
6059,TO THE FUTURE,"And gazing o'er the midnight's bleak abyss,"
6060,TO THE FUTURE,"Sees the drowsed soul awaken at thy kiss,"
6061,TO THE FUTURE,And stretch its happy arms and leap up disenchanted.
6062,TO THE FUTURE,
6063,TO THE FUTURE,"Thou bringest vengeance, but so loving-kindly"
6064,TO THE FUTURE,"The guilty thinks it pity; taught by thee,"
6065,TO THE FUTURE,Fierce tyrants drop the scourges wherewith blindly
6066,TO THE FUTURE,Their own souls they were scarring; conquerors see      60
6067,TO THE FUTURE,With horror in their hands the accursed spear
6068,TO THE FUTURE,"That tore the meek One's side on Calvary,"
6069,TO THE FUTURE,And from their trophies shrink with ghastly fear;
6070,TO THE FUTURE,"Thou, too, art the Forgiver,"
6071,TO THE FUTURE,The beauty of man's soul to man revealing;
6072,TO THE FUTURE,The arrows from thy quiver
6073,TO THE FUTURE,"Pierce Error's guilty heart, but only pierce for healing."
6074,TO THE FUTURE,
6075,TO THE FUTURE,"Oh, whither, whither, glory-wingèd dreams,"
6076,TO THE FUTURE,"From out Life's, sweat and turmoil would ye bear me?"
6077,TO THE FUTURE,"Shut, gates of Fancy, on your golden gleams,--                        70"
6078,TO THE FUTURE,This agony of hopeless contrast spare me!
6079,TO THE FUTURE,"Fade, cheating glow, and leave me to my night!"
6080,TO THE FUTURE,"He is a coward, who would borrow"
6081,TO THE FUTURE,A charm against the present sorrow
6082,TO THE FUTURE,From the vague Future's promise of delight:
6083,TO THE FUTURE,"As life's alarums nearer roll,"
6084,TO THE FUTURE,"The ancestral buckler calls,"
6085,TO THE FUTURE,Self-clanging from the walls
6086,TO THE FUTURE,In the high temple of the soul;
6087,TO THE FUTURE,"Where are most sorrows, there the poet's sphere is,       80"
6088,TO THE FUTURE,"To feed the soul with patience,"
6089,TO THE FUTURE,To heal its desolations
6090,TO THE FUTURE,"With words of unshorn truth, with love that never wearies."

6100,HEBE,
6101,HEBE,"As, in bare fields, the searching bees"
6102,HEBE,"Pilot to blooms beyond our finding,"
6103,HEBE,"It led me on, by sweet degrees"
6104,HEBE,Joy's simple honey-cells unbinding.
6105,HEBE,
6106,HEBE,Those Graces were that seemed grim Fates;
6107,HEBE,With nearer love the sky leaned o'er me;
6108,HEBE,The long-sought Secret's golden gates
6109,HEBE,On musical hinges swung before me.
6110,HEBE,
6111,HEBE,I saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp
6112,HEBE,Thrilling with godhood; like a lover
6113,HEBE,I sprang the proffered life to clasp;--
6114,HEBE,The beaker fell; the luck was over.

6124,HEBE,The immortal gift in vain libations.
6125,HEBE,

6133,THE SEARCH,THE SEARCH
6134,THE SEARCH,
6135,THE SEARCH,"I went to seek for Christ,"
6136,THE SEARCH,And Nature seemed so fair
6137,THE SEARCH,"That first the woods and fields my youth enticed,"
6138,THE SEARCH,And I was sure to find him there:
6139,THE SEARCH,"The temple I forsook,"
6140,THE SEARCH,And to the solitude
6141,THE SEARCH,Allegiance paid; but winter came and shook
6142,THE SEARCH,The crown and purple from my wood;
6143,THE SEARCH,"His snows, like desert sands, with scornful drift,"
6144,THE SEARCH,Besieged the columned aisle and palace-gate;
6145,THE SEARCH,"My Thebes, cut deep with many a solemn rift,"
6146,THE SEARCH,But epitaphed her own sepulchered state:
6147,THE SEARCH,"Then I remembered whom I went to seek,"
6148,THE SEARCH,And blessed blunt Winter for his counsel bleak.
6149,THE SEARCH,
6150,THE SEARCH,"Back to the world I turned,"
6151,THE SEARCH,"For Christ, I said, is King;"
6152,THE SEARCH,"So the cramped alley and the hut I spurned,"
6153,THE SEARCH,As far beneath his sojourning:
6154,THE SEARCH,"Mid power and wealth I sought,"
6155,THE SEARCH,"But found no trace of him,"
6156,THE SEARCH,And all the costly offerings I had brought
6157,THE SEARCH,With sudden rust and mould grew dim:
6158,THE SEARCH,"I found his tomb, indeed, where, by their laws,"
6159,THE SEARCH,"All must on stated days themselves imprison,"
6160,THE SEARCH,"Mocking with bread a dead creed's grinning jaws,"
6161,THE SEARCH,Witless how long the life had thence arisen;
6162,THE SEARCH,"Due sacrifice to this they set apart,"
6163,THE SEARCH,Prizing it more than Christ's own living heart.
6164,THE SEARCH,
6165,THE SEARCH,So from my feet the dust
6166,THE SEARCH,Of the proud World I shook;
6167,THE SEARCH,Then came dear Love and shared with me his crust.
6168,THE SEARCH,And half my sorrow's burden took.
6169,THE SEARCH,"After the World's soft bed,"
6170,THE SEARCH,"Its rich and dainty fare,"
6171,THE SEARCH,"Like down seemed Love's coarse pillow to my head,"
6172,THE SEARCH,His cheap food seemed as manna rare;
6173,THE SEARCH,"Fresh-trodden prints of bare and bleeding feet,"
6174,THE SEARCH,"Turned to the heedless city whence I came,"
6175,THE SEARCH,"Hard by I saw, and springs of worship sweet"
6176,THE SEARCH,Gushed from my cleft heart smitten by the same;
6177,THE SEARCH,"Love looked me in the face and spake no words,"
6178,THE SEARCH,But straight I knew those footprints were the Lord's.
6179,THE SEARCH,
6180,THE SEARCH,"I followed where they led,"
6181,THE SEARCH,"And in a hovel rude,"
6182,THE SEARCH,"With naught to fence the weather from his head,"
6183,THE SEARCH,The King I sought for meekly stood;
6184,THE SEARCH,"A naked, hungry child"
6185,THE SEARCH,"Clung round his gracious knee,"
6186,THE SEARCH,And a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled
6187,THE SEARCH,To bless the smile that set him free:
6188,THE SEARCH,"New miracles I saw his presence do,--"
6189,THE SEARCH,"No more I knew the hovel bare and poor,"
6190,THE SEARCH,"The gathered chips into a woodpile grew,"
6191,THE SEARCH,The broken morsel swelled to goodly store;
6192,THE SEARCH,"I knelt and wept: my Christ no more I seek,"
6193,THE SEARCH,His throne is with the outcast and the weak.

6204,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6205,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe,"

6211,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6212,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"So the Evil's triumph sendeth, with a terror and a chill,"
6213,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Under continent to continent, the sense of coming ill,"
6214,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels his sympathies with God"
6215,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"In hot tear-drops ebbing earthward, to be drunk up by the sod,"
6216,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Till a corpse crawls round unburied, delving in the nobler clod."
6217,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6218,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"For mankind are one in spirit, and an instinct bears along,"
6219,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Round the earth's electric circle, the swift flash of right or wrong;"
6220,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity's vast frame"
6221,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame;--
6222,THE PRESENT CRISIS,In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim.     20
6223,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6224,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,"
6225,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;"
6226,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,"
6227,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right,"
6228,THE PRESENT CRISIS,And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.
6229,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6230,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Hast thou chosen, O my people, on whose party thou shalt stand,"
6231,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Ere the Doom from its worn sandals shakes the dust against our land?
6232,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Though the cause of Evil prosper, yet 'tis Truth alone is strong,"
6233,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"And, albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng"

6235,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6236,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Backward look across the ages and the beacon-moments see,"
6237,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"That, like peaks of some sunk continent, jut through Oblivion's sea;"
6238,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Not an ear in court or market for the low foreboding cry
6239,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Of those Crises, God's stern winnowers, from whose feet earth's chaff"
6240,THE PRESENT CRISIS,must fly;
6241,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Never shows the choice momentous till the judgment hath passed by.
6242,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6243,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record
6244,THE PRESENT CRISIS,One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;
6245,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--"
6246,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,"
6247,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.     40"
6248,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6249,THE PRESENT CRISIS,We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great.
6250,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Slow of faith how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate,"
6251,THE PRESENT CRISIS,But the soul is still oracular; amid the market's din.
6252,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,--"
6253,THE PRESENT CRISIS,'They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin.'

6259,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Gropes in yet unblasted regions for his miserable prey;--
6260,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Shall we guide his gory fingers where our helpless children play?      50
6261,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6262,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,"
6263,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just;"
6264,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,"
6265,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified,"
6266,THE PRESENT CRISIS,And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.
6267,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6268,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,--they were souls that stood alone,"
6269,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,"
6270,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline"
6271,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,"
6272,THE PRESENT CRISIS,By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design.       60

6274,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"By the light of burning heretics Christ's bleeding feet I track,"
6275,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Toiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back,"
6276,THE PRESENT CRISIS,And these mounts of anguish number how each generation learned
6277,THE PRESENT CRISIS,One new word of that grand Credo which in prophet-hearts hath burned
6278,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Since the first man stood God-conquered with his face to heaven upturned.
6279,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6280,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands,"
6281,THE PRESENT CRISIS,On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands;
6282,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots burn,"
6283,THE PRESENT CRISIS,While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return
6284,THE PRESENT CRISIS,To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn.       70

6295,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Hoarding it in mouldy parchments, while our tender spirits flee      70"
6296,THE PRESENT CRISIS,The rude grasp of that great Impulse which drove them across the sea.
6297,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
6298,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our sires,"
6299,THE PRESENT CRISIS,Smothering in their holy ashes Freedom's new-lit altar-fires;
6300,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"Shall we make their creed our jailer? Shall we, in our haste to slay,"
6301,THE PRESENT CRISIS,From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away
6302,THE PRESENT CRISIS,To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day?
6303,THE PRESENT CRISIS,

6356,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Seeks cedar-berries blue, his autumn cheer;"
6357,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The chipmunk, on the shingly shag-bark's bough"
6358,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now saws, now lists with downward eye and ear,"
6359,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then drops his nut, and, cheeping, with a bound         40"
6360,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whisks to his winding fastness underground;
6361,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere.
6362,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6363,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows
6364,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drowse on the crisp, gray moss; the ploughman's call"
6365,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps faint as smoke from black, fresh-furrowed meadows;"
6366,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The single crow a single caw lets fall;
6367,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And all around me every bush and tree
6368,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Says Autumn's here, and Winter soon will be,"
6369,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who snows his soft, white sleep and silence over all."
6370,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6371,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The birch, most shy and ladylike of trees,       50"
6372,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Her poverty, as best she may, retrieves,"
6373,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And hints at her foregone gentilities
6374,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With some saved relics of her wealth of leaves;
6375,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The swamp-oak, with his royal purple on,"
6376,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Glares red as blood across the sinking sun,"
6377,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves.
6378,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6379,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"He looks a sachem, in red blanket wrapt,"
6380,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, mid some council of the sad-garbed whites,"
6381,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Erect and stern, in his own memories lapt,"
6382,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With distant eye broods over other sights,      60"
6383,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Sees the hushed wood the city's flare replace,"
6384,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wounded turf heal o'er the railway's trace,"
6385,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And roams the savage Past of his undwindled rights.
6386,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6387,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The red-oak, softer-grained, yields all for lost,"
6388,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And, with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry,"
6389,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"After the first betrayal of the frost,"
6390,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Rebuffs the kiss of the relenting sky;
6391,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The chestnuts, lavish of their long-hid gold,"
6392,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To the faint Summer, beggared now and old,"
6393,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Pour back the sunshine hoarded 'neath her favoring eye.       70
6394,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6395,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The ash her purple drops forgivingly
6396,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And sadly, breaking not the general hush;"
6397,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The maple-swamps glow like a sunset sea,"
6398,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
6399,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze
6400,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of bushes low, as when, on cloudy days,"
6401,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere the rain fall, the cautious farmer burns his brush."
6402,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6403,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"O'er yon low wall, which guards one unkempt zone,"
6404,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Where vines and weeds and scrub-oaks intertwine
6405,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Safe from the plough, whose rough, discordant stone        80"
6406,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Is massed to one soft gray by lichens fine,"
6407,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The tangled blackberry, crossed and recrossed, weaves"
6408,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A prickly network of ensanguined leaves;
6409,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hard by, with coral beads, the prim black-alders shine."
6410,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6411,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Pillaring with flame this crumbling boundary,"
6412,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose loose blocks topple 'neath the ploughboy's foot,"
6413,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, with each sense shut fast except the eye,"
6414,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps close and scares the jay he hoped to shoot,"
6415,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The woodbine up the elm's straight stem aspires,"
6416,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Coiling it, harmless, with autumnal fires;                  90"
6417,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In the ivy's paler blaze the martyr oak stands mute.
6418,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6419,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Below, the Charles, a stripe of nether sky,"
6420,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now hid by rounded apple-trees between,"
6421,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose gaps the misplaced sail sweeps bellying by,"
6422,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now flickering golden through a woodland screen,"
6423,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then spreading out, at his next turn beyond,"
6424,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A silver circle like an inland pond--
6425,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Slips seaward silently through marshes purple and green.
6426,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6427,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dear marshes! vain to him the gift of sight
6428,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who cannot in their various incomes share,                   100"
6429,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"From every season drawn, of shade and light,"
6430,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Who sees in them but levels brown and bare;
6431,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each change of storm or sunshine scatters free
6432,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"On them its largess of variety,"
6433,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,For Nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare.
6434,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6435,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In Spring they lie one broad expanse of green,"
6436,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er which the light winds run with glimmering feet:
6437,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Here, yellower stripes track out the creek unseen,"
6438,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There, darker growths o'er hidden ditches meet;"
6439,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd,         110"
6440,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As if the silent shadow of a cloud
6441,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hung there becalmed, with the next breath to fleet."
6442,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6443,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"All round, upon the river's slippery edge,"
6444,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Witching to deeper calm the drowsy tide,"
6445,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whispers and leans the breeze-entangling sedge;
6446,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through emerald glooms the lingering waters slide,"
6447,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or, sometimes wavering, throw back the sun,"
6448,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the stiff banks in eddies melt and run
6449,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of dimpling light, and with the current seem to glide."
6450,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6451,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In Summer 'tis a blithesome sight to see,                 120"
6452,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"As, step by step, with measured swing, they pass,"
6453,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wide-ranked mowers wading to the knee,"
6454,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their sharp scythes panting through the wiry grass;
6455,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, stretched beneath a rick's shade in a ring,"
6456,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Their nooning take, while one begins to sing"
6457,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A stave that droops and dies 'neath the close sky of brass.
6458,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6459,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Meanwhile that devil-may-care, the bobolink,"
6460,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Remembering duty, in mid-quaver stops"
6461,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Just ere he sweeps o'er rapture's tremulous brink.
6462,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And 'twixt the winrows most demurely drops,                 130"
6463,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"A decorous bird of business, who provides"
6464,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"For his brown mate and fledglings six besides,"
6465,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And looks from right to left, a farmer mid his crops."
6466,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6467,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Another change subdues them in the Fall,"
6468,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But saddens not; they still show merrier tints,"
6469,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Though sober russet seems to cover all;
6470,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When the first sunshine through their dew-drops glints,"
6471,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Look how the yellow clearness, streamed across,"
6472,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Redeems with rarer hues the season's loss,"
6473,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As Dawn's feet there had touched and left their rosy prints.     140
6474,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6475,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or come when sunset gives its freshened zest,"
6476,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lean o'er the bridge and let the ruddy thrill,"
6477,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While the shorn sun swells down the hazy west,"
6478,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Glow opposite;--the marshes drink their fill
6479,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And swoon with purple veins, then slowly fade"
6480,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through pink to brown, as eastward moves the shade,"
6481,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lengthening with stealthy creep, of Simonds' darkening hill."
6482,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6483,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Later, and yet ere Winter wholly shuts,"
6484,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere through the first dry snow the runner grates,"
6485,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And the loath cart-wheel screams in slippery ruts,      150"
6486,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While firmer ice the eager boy awaits,"
6487,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Trying each buckle and strap beside the fire,"
6488,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And until bedtime plays with his desire,"
6489,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twenty times putting on and off his new-bought skates;--
6490,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6491,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, every morn, the river's banks shine bright"
6492,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With smooth plate-armor, treacherous and frail,"
6493,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"By the frost's clinking hammers forged at night,"
6494,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"'Gainst which the lances of the sun prevail,"
6495,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Giving a pretty emblem of the day
6496,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When guiltier arms in light shall melt away,           160"
6497,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And states shall move free-limbed, loosed from war's cramping mail."
6498,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6499,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And now those waterfalls the ebbing river
6500,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twice every day creates on either side
6501,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Tinkle, as through their fresh-sparred grots they shiver"
6502,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In grass-arched channels to the sun denied;
6503,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"High flaps in sparkling blue the far-heard crow,"
6504,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The silvered flats gleam frostily below,"
6505,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide.
6506,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6507,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But crowned in turn by vying seasons three,"
6508,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their winter halo hath a fuller ring;                  170
6509,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"This glory seems to rest immovably,--"
6510,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The others were too fleet and vanishing;
6511,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,When the hid tide is at its highest flow.
6512,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er marsh and stream one breathless trance of snow
6513,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything.
6514,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6515,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind,"
6516,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As pale as formal candles lit by day;
6517,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Gropes to the sea the river dumb and blind;
6518,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The brown ricks, snow-thatched by the storm in play,"
6519,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Show pearly breakers combing o'er their lee,         180"
6520,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"White crests as of some just enchanted sea,"
6521,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Checked in their maddest leap and hanging poised midway.
6522,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6523,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But when the eastern blow, with rain aslant,"
6524,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,From mid-sea's prairies green and rolling plains
6525,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drives in his wallowing herds of billows gaunt,"
6526,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the roused Charles remembers in his veins
6527,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Old Ocean's blood and snaps his gyves of frost,"
6528,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That tyrannous silence on the shores is tost
6529,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In dreary wreck, and crumbling desolation reigns."
6530,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6531,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Edgewise or flat, in Druid-like device,            190"
6532,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With leaden pools between or gullies bare,"
6533,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice;"
6534,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"No life, no sound, to break the grim despair,"
6535,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff"
6536,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Down crackles riverward some thaw-sapped cliff,"
6537,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Or when the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there.
6538,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6539,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,But let me turn from fancy-pictured scenes
6540,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,To that whose pastoral calm before me lies:
6541,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes;
6542,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The early evening with her misty dyes             200
6543,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh,"
6544,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Relieves the distant with her cooler sky,"
6545,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes."
6546,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6547,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There gleams my native village, dear to me,"
6548,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Though higher change's waves each day are seen,"
6549,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whelming fields famed in boyhood's history,"
6550,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Sanding with houses the diminished green;
6551,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There, in red brick, which softening time defies,"
6552,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Stand square and stiff the Muses' factories:--
6553,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,How with my life knit up is every well-known scene!      210
6554,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6555,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Flow on, dear river! not alone you flow"
6556,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To outward sight, and through your marshes wind;"
6557,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Fed from the mystic springs of long-ago,"
6558,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Your twin flows silent through my world of mind:
6559,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Grow dim, dear marshes, in the evening's gray!"
6560,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Before my inner sight ye stretch away,"
6561,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And will forever, though these fleshly eyes grow blind."
6562,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6563,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Beyond the hillock's house-bespotted swell,"
6564,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where Gothic chapels house the horse and chaise,"
6565,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where quiet cits in Grecian temples dwell,          220"
6566,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where Coptic tombs resound with prayer and praise,"
6567,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where dust and mud the equal year divide,"
6568,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There gentle Allston lived, and wrought, and died,"
6569,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Transfiguring street and shop with his illumined gaze.
6570,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6571,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"_Virgilium vidi tantum_,--I have seen"
6572,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But as a boy, who looks alike on all,"
6573,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That misty hair, that fine Undine-like mien,"
6574,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Tremulous as down to feeling's faintest call;--
6575,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ah, dear old homestead! count it to thy fame"
6576,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That thither many times the Painter came;--       230
6577,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"One elm yet bears his name, a feathery tree and tall."
6578,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6579,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Swiftly the present fades in memory's glow,--"
6580,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Our only sure possession is the past;
6581,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The village blacksmith died a month ago,"
6582,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And dim to me the forge's roaring blast;
6583,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Soon fire-new mediævals we shall see
6584,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Oust the black smithy from its chestnut-tree,"
6585,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And that hewn down, perhaps, the beehive green and vast."
6586,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6587,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How many times, prouder than king on throne,"
6588,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Loosed from the village school-dame's A's and B's,        240"
6589,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Panting have I the creaky bellows blown,"
6590,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And watched the pent volcano's red increase,"
6591,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then paused to see the ponderous sledge, brought down"
6592,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"By that hard arm voluminous and brown,"
6593,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,From the white iron swarm its golden vanishing bees.
6594,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6595,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dear native town! whose choking elms each year
6596,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With eddying dust before their time turn gray,"
6597,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Pining for rain,--to me thy dust is dear;"
6598,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"It glorifies the eve of summer day,"
6599,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And when the westering sun half sunken burns,        250"
6600,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The mote-thick air to deepest orange turns,"
6601,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The westward horseman rides through clouds of gold away.
6602,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6603,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"So palpable, I've seen those unshorn few,"
6604,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The six old willows at the causey's end
6605,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"(Such trees Paul Potter never dreamed nor drew),"
6606,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through this dry mist their checkering shadows send,"
6607,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Striped, here and there, with many a long-drawn thread,"
6608,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where streamed through leafy chinks the trembling red,"
6609,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Past which, in one bright trail, the hangbird's flashes blend."
6610,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6611,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Yes, dearer far thy dust than all that e'er,        260"
6612,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Beneath the awarded crown of victory,"
6613,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Gilded the blown Olympic charioteer;
6614,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Though lightly prized the ribboned parchments three,"
6615,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Yet _collegisse juvat_, I am glad"
6616,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That here what colleging was mine I had,--"
6617,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"It linked another tie, dear native town, with thee!"
6618,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6619,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Nearer art thou than simply native earth,"
6620,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,My dust with thine concedes a deeper tie;
6621,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"A closer claim thy soil may well put forth,"
6622,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Something of kindred more than sympathy;     270
6623,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,For in thy bounds I reverently laid away
6624,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That blinding anguish of forsaken clay,"
6625,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That title I seemed to have in earth and sea and sky,"
6626,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
6627,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That portion of my life more choice to me
6628,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"(Though brief, yet in itself so round and whole)"
6629,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Than all the imperfect residue can be;--
6630,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The Artist saw his statue of the soul
6631,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Was perfect; so, with one regretful stroke,"
6632,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The earthen model into fragments broke,"
6633,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And without her the impoverished seasons roll.      280

6639,A FRAGMENT,A FRAGMENT
6640,A FRAGMENT,
6641,A FRAGMENT,A legend that grew in the forest's hush
6642,A FRAGMENT,"Slowly as tear-drops gather and gush,"
6643,A FRAGMENT,When a word some poet chanced to say
6644,A FRAGMENT,"Ages ago, in his careless way,"
6645,A FRAGMENT,Brings our youth back to us out of its shroud
6646,A FRAGMENT,Clearly as under yon thunder-cloud
6647,A FRAGMENT,"I see that white sea-gull. It grew and grew,"
6648,A FRAGMENT,"From the pine-trees gathering a sombre hue,"
6649,A FRAGMENT,Till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast
6650,A FRAGMENT,Norwegian forests of the past;      10
6651,A FRAGMENT,"And it grew itself like a true Northern pine,"
6652,A FRAGMENT,"First a little slender line,"
6653,A FRAGMENT,"Like a mermaid's green eyelash, and then anon"
6654,A FRAGMENT,"A stem that a tower might rest upon,"
6655,A FRAGMENT,"Standing spear-straight in the waist-deep moss,"
6656,A FRAGMENT,"Its bony roots clutching around and across,"
6657,A FRAGMENT,As if they would tear up earth's heart in their grasp

6660,A FRAGMENT,"To snow-bearded sea-kings old songs of the brine,      20"
6661,A FRAGMENT,"Till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor,"
6662,A FRAGMENT,Hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore
6663,A FRAGMENT,"Of Vinland, perhaps, while their prow groped its way"

6864,THE OAK,"What gnarlèd stretch, what depth of shade, is his!"
6865,THE OAK,There needs no crown to mark the forest's king;
6866,THE OAK,How in his leaves outshines full summer's bliss!
6867,THE OAK,"Sun, storm, rain, dew, to him their tribute bring,"
6868,THE OAK,Which he with such benignant royalty
6869,THE OAK,"Accepts, as overpayeth what is lent;"
6870,THE OAK,"All nature seems his vassal proud to be,"
6871,THE OAK,And cunning only for his ornament.
6872,THE OAK,
6873,THE OAK,"How towers he, too, amid the billowed snows,"
6874,THE OAK,"An unquelled exile from the summer's throne,"
6875,THE OAK,"Whose plain, uncinctured front more kingly shows,"
6876,THE OAK,Now that the obscuring courtier leaves are flown.
6877,THE OAK,"His boughs make music of the winter air,"
6878,THE OAK,"Jewelled with sleet, like some cathedral front"

6880,THE OAK,The dints and furrows of time's envious brunt.
6881,THE OAK,
6882,THE OAK,How doth his patient strength the rude March wind
6883,THE OAK,"Persuade to seem glad breaths of summer breeze,"
6884,THE OAK,"And win the soil that fain would be unkind,"
6885,THE OAK,To swell his revenues with proud increase!
6886,THE OAK,He is the gem; and all the landscape wide
6887,THE OAK,(So doth his grandeur isolate the sense)
6888,THE OAK,"Seems but the setting, worthless all beside,"
6889,THE OAK,"An empty socket, were he fallen thence."

6891,THE OAK,"So, from oft converse with life's wintry gales,"

6893,THE OAK,The inspiring earth; how otherwise avails
6894,THE OAK,The leaf-creating sap that sunward shoots?
6895,THE OAK,So every year that falls with noiseless flake
6896,THE OAK,"Should fill old scars up on the stormward side,"
6897,THE OAK,"And make hoar age revered for age's sake,"
6898,THE OAK,Not for traditions of youth's leafy pride.
6899,THE OAK,
6900,THE OAK,"So, from the pinched soil of a churlish fate,"
6901,THE OAK,"True hearts compel the sap of sturdier growth,"
6902,THE OAK,"So between earth and heaven stand simply great,"
6903,THE OAK,That these shall seem but their attendants both;
6904,THE OAK,For nature's forces with obedient zeal
6905,THE OAK,Wait on the rooted faith and oaken will;
6906,THE OAK,"As quickly the pretender's cheat they feel,"
6907,THE OAK,And turn mad Pucks to flout and mock him still.
6908,THE OAK,
6909,THE OAK,Lord! all thy works are lessons; each contains
6910,THE OAK,Some emblem of man's all-containing soul;
6911,THE OAK,"Shall he make fruitless all thy glorious pains,"
6912,THE OAK,Delving within thy grace an eyeless mole?
6913,THE OAK,"Make me the least of thy Dodona-grove,"
6914,THE OAK,"Cause me some message of thy truth to bring,"

6926,AMBROSE,"With bed of iron and scourgings oft,"
6927,AMBROSE,His heart to God's hand as wax made soft.
6928,AMBROSE,
6929,AMBROSE,Through earnest prayer and watchings long
6930,AMBROSE,"He sought to know 'tween right and wrong,"
6931,AMBROSE,Much wrestling with the blessed Word
6932,AMBROSE,"To make it yield the sense of the Lord,      10"
6933,AMBROSE,That he might build a storm-proof creed

6936,AMBROSE,"At last he builded a perfect faith,"
6937,AMBROSE,Fenced round about with _The Lord thus saith_;
6938,AMBROSE,"To himself he fitted the doorway's size,"
6939,AMBROSE,"Meted the light to the need of his eyes,"
6940,AMBROSE,"And knew, by a sure and inward sign,"
6941,AMBROSE,That the work of his fingers was divine.
6942,AMBROSE,
6943,AMBROSE,"Then Ambrose said, 'All those shall die"

6945,AMBROSE,"And some were boiled, some burned in fire,"
6946,AMBROSE,"Some sawn in twain, that his heart's desire,"
6947,AMBROSE,For the good of men's souls might be satisfied
6948,AMBROSE,By the drawing of all to the righteous side.
6949,AMBROSE,
6950,AMBROSE,"One day, as Ambrose was seeking the truth"
6951,AMBROSE,"In his lonely walk, he saw a youth"
6952,AMBROSE,Resting himself in the shade of a tree;
6953,AMBROSE,It had never been granted him to see
6954,AMBROSE,"So shining a face, and the good man thought"
6955,AMBROSE,'Twere pity he should not believe as he ought.      30
6956,AMBROSE,
6957,AMBROSE,"So he set himself by the young man's side,"
6958,AMBROSE,And the state of his soul with questions tried;
6959,AMBROSE,"But the heart of the stranger was hardened indeed,"
6960,AMBROSE,Nor received the stamp of the one true creed;
6961,AMBROSE,And the spirit of Ambrose waxed sore to find
6962,AMBROSE,Such features the porch of so narrow a mind.
6963,AMBROSE,
6964,AMBROSE,'As each beholds in cloud and fire
6965,AMBROSE,"The shape that answers his own desire,"
6966,AMBROSE,"So each,' said the youth, 'in the Law shall find"
6967,AMBROSE,The figure and fashion of his mind;         40
6968,AMBROSE,And to each in his mercy hath God allowed
6969,AMBROSE,His several pillar of fire and cloud.'
6970,AMBROSE,
6971,AMBROSE,The soul of Ambrose burned with zeal
6972,AMBROSE,And holy wrath for the young man's weal:
6973,AMBROSE,"'Believest thou then, most wretched youth,'"
6974,AMBROSE,"Cried he, 'a dividual essence in Truth?"
6975,AMBROSE,I fear me thy heart is too cramped with sin
6976,AMBROSE,To take the Lord in his glory in.'
6977,AMBROSE,
6978,AMBROSE,Now there bubbled beside them where they stood
6979,AMBROSE,A fountain of waters sweet and good:        50
6980,AMBROSE,The youth to the streamlet's brink drew near
6981,AMBROSE,"Saying, 'Ambrose, thou maker of creeds, look here!'"
6982,AMBROSE,"Six vases of crystal then he took,"
6983,AMBROSE,And set them along the edge of the brook.
6984,AMBROSE,
6985,AMBROSE,"'As into these vessels the water I pour,"
6986,AMBROSE,"There shall one hold less, another more,"
6987,AMBROSE,"And the water unchanged, in every case,"
6988,AMBROSE,Shall put on the figure of the vase;
6989,AMBROSE,"O thou, who wouldst unity make through strife,"
6990,AMBROSE,Canst thou fit this sign to the Water of Life?'      60
6991,AMBROSE,
6992,AMBROSE,"When Ambrose looked up, he stood alone,"
6993,AMBROSE,The youth and the stream and the vases were gone;
6994,AMBROSE,"But he knew, by a sense of humbled grace,"
6995,AMBROSE,"He had talked with an angel face to face,"
6996,AMBROSE,"And felt his heart change inwardly,"
6997,AMBROSE,As he fell on his knees beneath the tree.

7068,THE CAPTIVE,But she lingered for him still;
7069,THE CAPTIVE,"Like a child, the eager streamlet"
7070,THE CAPTIVE,"Leaped and laughed adown the hill,"
7071,THE CAPTIVE,Happy to be free at twilight
7072,THE CAPTIVE,From its toiling at the mill.
7073,THE CAPTIVE,
7074,THE CAPTIVE,Then the great moon on a sudden
7075,THE CAPTIVE,"Ominous, and red as blood,"
7076,THE CAPTIVE,"Startling as a new creation,"
7077,THE CAPTIVE,"O'er the eastern hilltop stood,"
7078,THE CAPTIVE,Casting deep and deeper shadows
7079,THE CAPTIVE,Through the mystery of the wood.
7080,THE CAPTIVE,
7081,THE CAPTIVE,"Dread closed fast and vague about her,"
7082,THE CAPTIVE,And her thoughts turned fearfully
7083,THE CAPTIVE,"To her heart, if there some shelter"
7084,THE CAPTIVE,"From the silence there might be,"
7085,THE CAPTIVE,Like bare cedars leaning inland
7086,THE CAPTIVE,From the blighting of the sea.
7087,THE CAPTIVE,
7088,THE CAPTIVE,"Yet he came not, and the stillness"
7089,THE CAPTIVE,Dampened round her like a tomb;
7090,THE CAPTIVE,She could feel cold eyes of spirits
7091,THE CAPTIVE,"Looking on her through the gloom,"
7092,THE CAPTIVE,She could hear the groping footsteps
7093,THE CAPTIVE,"Of some blind, gigantic doom."
7094,THE CAPTIVE,
7095,THE CAPTIVE,Suddenly the silence wavered
7096,THE CAPTIVE,"Like a light mist in the wind,"
7097,THE CAPTIVE,"For a voice broke gently through it,"
7098,THE CAPTIVE,"Felt like sunshine by the blind,"
7099,THE CAPTIVE,"And the dread, like mist in sunshine,"
7100,THE CAPTIVE,Furled serenely from her mind.
7101,THE CAPTIVE,
7102,THE CAPTIVE,"'Once my love, my love forever,"
7103,THE CAPTIVE,"Flesh or spirit, still the same,"
7104,THE CAPTIVE,"If I failed at time of trysting,"
7105,THE CAPTIVE,Deem then not my faith to blame;
7106,THE CAPTIVE,"I, alas, was made a captive,"
7107,THE CAPTIVE,As from Holy Land I came.
7108,THE CAPTIVE,
7109,THE CAPTIVE,"'On a green spot in the desert,"
7110,THE CAPTIVE,"Gleaming like an emerald star,"
7111,THE CAPTIVE,"Where a palm-tree, in lone silence,"
7112,THE CAPTIVE,"Yearning for its mate afar,"
7113,THE CAPTIVE,"Droops above a silver runnel,"
7114,THE CAPTIVE,"Slender as a scimitar,"
7115,THE CAPTIVE,
7116,THE CAPTIVE,'There thou'lt find the humble postern
7117,THE CAPTIVE,To the castle of my foe;
7118,THE CAPTIVE,"If thy love burn clear and faithful,"
7119,THE CAPTIVE,"Strike the gateway, green and low,"
7120,THE CAPTIVE,"Ask to enter, and the warder"
7121,THE CAPTIVE,Surely will not say thee no.'
7122,THE CAPTIVE,
7123,THE CAPTIVE,"Slept again the aspen silence,"
7124,THE CAPTIVE,But her loneliness was o'er;
7125,THE CAPTIVE,Bound her soul a motherly patience
7126,THE CAPTIVE,Clasped its arms forevermore;
7127,THE CAPTIVE,"From her heart ebbed back the sorrow,"
7128,THE CAPTIVE,Leaving smooth the golden shore.
7129,THE CAPTIVE,
7130,THE CAPTIVE,"Donned she now the pilgrim scallop,"
7131,THE CAPTIVE,Took the pilgrim staff in hand;
7132,THE CAPTIVE,"Like a cloud-shade flitting eastward,"
7133,THE CAPTIVE,Wandered she o'er sea and land;
7134,THE CAPTIVE,And her footsteps in the desert
7135,THE CAPTIVE,Fell like cool rain on the sand.
7136,THE CAPTIVE,
7137,THE CAPTIVE,"Soon, beneath the palm-tree's shadow,"
7138,THE CAPTIVE,Knelt she at the postern low;
7139,THE CAPTIVE,"And thereat she knocked full gently,"
7140,THE CAPTIVE,Fearing much the warder's no;
7141,THE CAPTIVE,"All her heart stood still and listened,"
7142,THE CAPTIVE,As the door swung backward slow.
7143,THE CAPTIVE,
7144,THE CAPTIVE,There she saw no surly warder
7145,THE CAPTIVE,With an eye like bolt and bar;
7146,THE CAPTIVE,Through her soul a sense of music
7147,THE CAPTIVE,"Throbbed, and, like a guardian Lar,"
7148,THE CAPTIVE,"On the threshold stood an angel,"
7149,THE CAPTIVE,Bright and silent as a star.
7150,THE CAPTIVE,
7151,THE CAPTIVE,"Fairest seemed he of God's seraphs,"
7152,THE CAPTIVE,"And her spirit, lily-wise,"
7153,THE CAPTIVE,Opened when he turned upon her
7154,THE CAPTIVE,"The deep welcome of his eyes,"
7155,THE CAPTIVE,Sending upward to that sunlight
7156,THE CAPTIVE,All its dew for sacrifice.
7157,THE CAPTIVE,
7158,THE CAPTIVE,Then she heard a voice come onward
7159,THE CAPTIVE,"Singing with a rapture new,"
7160,THE CAPTIVE,"As Eve heard the songs in Eden,"
7161,THE CAPTIVE,Dropping earthward with the dew;
7162,THE CAPTIVE,"Well she knew the happy singer,"
7163,THE CAPTIVE,Well the happy song she knew.
7164,THE CAPTIVE,
7165,THE CAPTIVE,"Forward leaped she o'er the threshold,"
7166,THE CAPTIVE,Eager as a glancing surf;
7167,THE CAPTIVE,"Fell from her the spirit's languor,"
7168,THE CAPTIVE,Fell from her the body's scurf;
7169,THE CAPTIVE,'Neath the palm next day some Arabs
7170,THE CAPTIVE,Found a corpse upon the turf.

7204,THE BIRCH-TREE,And Nature gives me all her summer confidences.
7205,THE BIRCH-TREE,

7534,THE GHOST-SEER,There are bloodhounds on her trail!       20
7535,THE GHOST-SEER,"Bloodhounds two, all gaunt and lean,"

7540,THE GHOST-SEER,Sin awakened with a growl.
7541,THE GHOST-SEER,"Ah, poor girl! she had a right"
7542,THE GHOST-SEER,To a blessing from the light;
7543,THE GHOST-SEER,Title-deeds to sky and earth
7544,THE GHOST-SEER,God gave to her at her birth;        30
7545,THE GHOST-SEER,"But, before they were enjoyed,"
7546,THE GHOST-SEER,"Poverty had made them void,"
7547,THE GHOST-SEER,And had drunk the sunshine up
7548,THE GHOST-SEER,"From all nature's ample cup,"
7549,THE GHOST-SEER,Leaving her a first-born's share
7550,THE GHOST-SEER,In the dregs of darkness there.
7551,THE GHOST-SEER,"Often, on the sidewalk bleak,"

7557,THE GHOST-SEER,Till each ray that on her fell
7558,THE GHOST-SEER,"Stabbed her like an icicle,"
7559,THE GHOST-SEER,And she almost loved the wail
7560,THE GHOST-SEER,Of the bloodhounds on her trail.
7561,THE GHOST-SEER,"Till the floor becomes her bier,"
7562,THE GHOST-SEER,"She shall feel their pantings near,"

7600,THE GHOST-SEER,Sold God's presence in his heart
7601,THE GHOST-SEER,For a proud step in the mart;
7602,THE GHOST-SEER,He hath dealt in flesh and blood:
7603,THE GHOST-SEER,At the bank his name is good;
7604,THE GHOST-SEER,"At the bank, and only there,"
7605,THE GHOST-SEER,'Tis a marketable ware.              90

7608,THE GHOST-SEER,"But it has the cold, hard glint"
7609,THE GHOST-SEER,Of new dollars from the mint.
7610,THE GHOST-SEER,"Open now your spirit's eyes,"
7611,THE GHOST-SEER,Look through that poor clay disguise
7612,THE GHOST-SEER,"Which has thickened, day by day,"
7613,THE GHOST-SEER,"Till it keeps all light at bay,"
7614,THE GHOST-SEER,And his soul in pitchy gloom
7615,THE GHOST-SEER,"Gropes about its narrow tomb,       100"
7616,THE GHOST-SEER,From whose dank and slimy walls
7617,THE GHOST-SEER,Drop by drop the horror falls.
7618,THE GHOST-SEER,Look! a serpent lank and cold
7619,THE GHOST-SEER,Hugs his spirit fold on fold;
7620,THE GHOST-SEER,"From his heart, all day and night,"
7621,THE GHOST-SEER,It doth suck God's blessed light.
7622,THE GHOST-SEER,"Drink it will, and drink it must,"
7623,THE GHOST-SEER,Till the cup holds naught but dust;
7624,THE GHOST-SEER,"All day long he hears it hiss,"
7625,THE GHOST-SEER,Writhing in its fiendish bliss;       110
7626,THE GHOST-SEER,All night long he sees its eyes
7627,THE GHOST-SEER,"Flicker with foul ecstasies,"
7628,THE GHOST-SEER,As the spirit ebbs away
7629,THE GHOST-SEER,Into the absorbing clay.
7630,THE GHOST-SEER,"Who is he that skulks, afraid"
7631,THE GHOST-SEER,"Of the trust he has betrayed,"
7632,THE GHOST-SEER,Shuddering if perchance a gleam
7633,THE GHOST-SEER,Of old nobleness should stream
7634,THE GHOST-SEER,"Through the pent, unwholesome room,"
7635,THE GHOST-SEER,"Where his shrunk soul cowers in gloom,       120"
7636,THE GHOST-SEER,Spirit sad beyond the rest

7645,THE GHOST-SEER,"Of the weak and spirit-wrung,      130"
7646,THE GHOST-SEER,Whence the fiery-winged Despair
7647,THE GHOST-SEER,In men's shrinking eyes might flare.

7652,THE GHOST-SEER,Raining down melodious hope

7657,THE GHOST-SEER,"That, with eyes refusing light,"
7658,THE GHOST-SEER,Hooted from some hollow tree
7659,THE GHOST-SEER,Of the world's idolatry.
7660,THE GHOST-SEER,'Tis his punishment to hear
7661,THE GHOST-SEER,"Sweep of eager pinions near,"
7662,THE GHOST-SEER,And his own vain wings to feel
7663,THE GHOST-SEER,"Drooping downward to his heel,"
7664,THE GHOST-SEER,"All their grace and import lost,"
7665,THE GHOST-SEER,Burdening his weary ghost:      150

7671,THE GHOST-SEER,"Of hushed anguish in her eyes,"
7672,THE GHOST-SEER,That it seems the light of day
7673,THE GHOST-SEER,"From around him shrinks away,"
7674,THE GHOST-SEER,Or drops blunted from the wall
7675,THE GHOST-SEER,Built around him by his fall.      160
7676,THE GHOST-SEER,"Then the mountains, whose white peaks"
7677,THE GHOST-SEER,"Catch the morning's earliest streaks,"
7678,THE GHOST-SEER,"He must see, where prophets sit,"

8142,THE CHANGELING,The very heart of her mother
8143,THE CHANGELING,Sending sun through her veins to me!
8144,THE CHANGELING,
8145,THE CHANGELING,"She had been with us scarce a twelvemonth,"
8146,THE CHANGELING,"And it hardly seemed a day,"
8147,THE CHANGELING,When a troop of wandering angels
8148,THE CHANGELING,Stole my little daughter away;
8149,THE CHANGELING,Or perhaps those heavenly Zingari
8150,THE CHANGELING,"But loosed the hampering strings,"
8151,THE CHANGELING,And when they had opened her cage-door.
8152,THE CHANGELING,My little bird used her wings.
8153,THE CHANGELING,
8154,THE CHANGELING,But they left in her stead a changeling
8155,THE CHANGELING,"A little angel child,"
8156,THE CHANGELING,"That seems like her bud in full blossom,"
8157,THE CHANGELING,And smiles as she never smiled:
8158,THE CHANGELING,"When I wake in the morning, I see it"
8159,THE CHANGELING,"Where she always used to lie,"
8160,THE CHANGELING,And I feel as weak as a violet
8161,THE CHANGELING,Alone 'neath the awful sky.
8162,THE CHANGELING,
8163,THE CHANGELING,"As weak, yet as trustful also;"
8164,THE CHANGELING,For the whole year long I see
8165,THE CHANGELING,All the wonders of faithful Nature
8166,THE CHANGELING,Still worked for the love of me;
8167,THE CHANGELING,"Winds wander, and dews drip earthward,"
8168,THE CHANGELING,"Rain falls, suns rise and set,"
8169,THE CHANGELING,"Earth whirls, and all but to prosper"
8170,THE CHANGELING,A poor little violet.
8171,THE CHANGELING,
8172,THE CHANGELING,"This child is not mine as the first was,"
8173,THE CHANGELING,"I cannot sing it to rest,"
8174,THE CHANGELING,I cannot lift it up fatherly
8175,THE CHANGELING,And bliss it upon my breast:
8176,THE CHANGELING,Yet it lies in my little one's cradle
8177,THE CHANGELING,"And sits in my little one's chair,"
8178,THE CHANGELING,And the light of the heaven she's gone to
8179,THE CHANGELING,Transfigures its golden hair.

8226,THE PIONEER,
8227,THE PIONEER,Each man is some man's servant; every soul

8229,THE PIONEER,"Each owes the next through all the imperfect round,"
8230,THE PIONEER,"Yet not with mutual help; each man is his own goal,"
8231,THE PIONEER,And the whole earth must stop to pay him toll.

8241,THE PIONEER,"Which the new life can shatter, but not mould;"

9613,I,"'My golden spurs now bring to me,"
9614,I,"And bring to me my richest mail,"
9615,I,For to-morrow I go over land and sea
9616,I,In search of the Holy Grail;
9617,I,"Shall never a bed for me be spread,                   100"
9618,I,"Nor shall a pillow be under my head,"
9619,I,Till I begin my vow to keep;
9620,I,"Here on the rushes will I sleep,"
9621,I,And perchance there may come a vision true
9622,I,Ere day create the world anew.'
9623,I,"Slowly Sir Launfal's eyes grew dim,"
9624,I,"Slumber fell like a cloud on him,"
9625,I,And into his soul the vision flew.

9629,II,
9630,II,"The crows flapped over by twos and threes,"
9631,II,"In the pool drowsed the cattle up to their knees,     110"
9632,II,The little birds sang as if it were
9633,II,"The one day of summer in all the year,"
9634,II,And the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees:
9635,II,The castle alone in the landscape lay
9636,II,"Like an outpost of winter, dull and gray:"
9637,II,"'Twas the proudest hall in the North Countree,"
9638,II,"And never its gates might opened be,"
9639,II,Save to lord or lady of high degree;
9640,II,"Summer besieged it on every side,"
9641,II,But the churlish stone her assaults defied;           120
9642,II,"She could not scale the chilly wall,"
9643,II,Though around it for leagues her pavilions tall
9644,II,"Stretched left and right,"
9645,II,Over the hills and out of sight;
9646,II,"Green and broad was every tent,"
9647,II,And out of each a murmur went
9648,II,Till the breeze fell off at night.

9650,II,
9651,III,III
9652,III,
9653,III,"The drawbridge dropped with a surly clang,"
9654,III,"And through the dark arch a charger sprang,"
9655,III,"Bearing Sir Launfal, the maiden knight,               130"
9656,III,"In his gilded mail, that flamed so bright"
9657,III,It seemed the dark castle had gathered all
9658,III,Those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall
9659,III,"In his siege of three hundred summers long,"
9660,III,"And, binding them all in one blazing sheaf,"
9661,III,"Had cast them forth: so, young and strong,"
9662,III,"And lightsome as a locust-leaf,"
9663,III,"Sir Launfal flashed forth in his maiden mail,"
9664,III,To seek in all climes for the Holy Grail.

9668,IV,
9669,IV,"It was morning on hill and stream and tree,           140"
9670,IV,And morning in the young knight's heart;
9671,IV,Only the castle moodily
9672,IV,"Rebuffed the gifts of the sunshine free,"
9673,IV,And gloomed by itself apart;
9674,IV,The season brimmed all other things up
9675,IV,Full as the rain fills the pitcher-plant's cup.

9679,V,
9680,V,"As Sir Launfal made morn through the darksome gate,"
9681,V,"He was 'ware of a leper, crouched by the same,"
9682,V,Who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate;
9683,V,And a loathing over Sir Launfal came;               150
9684,V,"The sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill,"
9685,V,"The flesh 'neath his armor 'gan shrink and crawl,"
9686,V,And midway its leap his heart stood still
9687,V,Like a frozen waterfall;
9688,V,"For this man, so foul and bent of stature,"
9689,V,"Rasped harshly against his dainty nature,"
9690,V,"And seemed the one blot on the summer morn,--"
9691,V,So he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn.
9692,V,
9693,V,
9694,VI,VI
9695,VI,
9696,VI,The leper raised not the gold from the dust:
9697,VI,"'Better to me the poor man's crust,                   160"
9698,VI,"Better the blessing of the poor,"
9699,VI,Though I turn me empty from his door;
9700,VI,That is no true alms which the hand can hold;
9701,VI,He gives only the worthless gold
9702,VI,Who gives from a sense of duty;
9703,VI,"But he who gives but a slender mite,"
9704,VI,"And gives to that which is out of sight,"
9705,VI,That thread of the all-sustaining Beauty
9706,VI,"Which runs through all and doth all unite,--"
9707,VI,"The hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms,          170"
9708,VI,"The heart outstretches its eager palms,"
9709,VI,For a god goes with it and makes it store
9710,VI,To the soul that was starving in darkness before.'

9716,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak,"
9717,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,From the snow five thousand summers old;
9718,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,On open wold and hilltop bleak
9719,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"It had gathered all the cold,"
9720,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer's cheek;
9721,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,It carried a shiver everywhere
9722,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare;      180
9723,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,The little brook heard it and built a roof
9724,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"'Neath which he could house him, winter-proof;"
9725,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,All night by the white stars' frosty gleams
9726,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,He groined his arches and matched his beams;
9727,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Slender and clear were his crystal spars
9728,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,As the lashes of light that trim the stars:
9729,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,He sculptured every summer delight
9730,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,In his halls and chambers out of sight;
9731,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt
9732,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt,      190"
9733,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees"
9734,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Bending to counterfeit a breeze;
9735,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew
9736,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,But silvery mosses that downward grew;
9737,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief
9738,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf;
9739,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear
9740,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"For the gladness of heaven to shine through, and here"
9741,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops
9742,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"And hung them thickly with diamond drops,     200"
9743,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"That crystalled the beams of moon and sun,"
9744,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And made a star of every one:
9745,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,No mortal builder's most rare device
9746,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Could match this winter-palace of ice;
9747,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,'Twas as if every image that mirrored lay
9748,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"In his depths serene through the summer day,"
9749,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Each fleeting shadow of earth and sky,"
9750,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Lest the happy model should be lost,"
9751,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Had been mimicked in fairy masonry
9752,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,By the elfin builders of the frost.     210
9753,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,
9754,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Within the hall are song and laughter,"
9755,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"The cheeks of Christmas glow red and jolly,"
9756,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And sprouting is every corbel and rafter
9757,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,With lightsome green of ivy and holly;
9758,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide
9759,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Wallows the Yule-log's roaring tide;
9760,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,The broad flame-pennons droop and flap
9761,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And belly and tug as a flag in the wind;
9762,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap,"
9763,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Hunted to death in its galleries blind;     220
9764,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"And swift little troops of silent sparks,"
9765,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Now pausing, now scattering away as in fear,"
9766,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Go threading the soot-forest's tangled darks
9767,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Like herds of startled deer.
9768,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,
9769,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"But the wind without was eager and sharp,"
9770,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Of Sir Launfal's gray hair it makes a harp,"
9771,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And rattles and wrings
9772,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"The icy strings,"

9775,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Whose burden still, as he might guess,"
9776,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Was 'Shelterless, shelterless, shelterless!'"
9777,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,The voice of the seneschal flared like a torch
9778,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"As he shouted the wanderer away from the porch,"
9779,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,And he sat in the gateway and saw all night
9780,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"The great hall-fire, so cheery and bold,"
9781,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,"Through the window-slits of the castle old,"
9782,PRELUDE TO PART SECOND,Build out its piers of ruddy light

9816,III,
9817,III,Sir Launfal's raiment thin and spare
9818,III,"Was idle mail 'gainst the barbèd air,"
9819,III,For it was just at the Christmas time;         260
9820,III,"So he mused, as he sat, of a sunnier clime,"
9821,III,And sought for a shelter from cold and snow
9822,III,In the light and warmth of long-ago;
9823,III,He sees the snake-like caravan crawl
9824,III,"O'er the edge of the desert, black and small,"
9825,III,"Then nearer and nearer, till, one by one,"
9826,III,"He can count the camels in the sun,"

9828,III,"To where, in its slender necklace of grass,"
9829,III,"The little spring laughed and leapt in the shade,      270"
9830,III,"And with its own self like an infant played,"

9835,IV,
9836,IV,"'For Christ's sweet sake, I beg an alms;'"
9837,IV,"The happy camels may reach the spring,"

9839,IV,"The leper, lank as the rain-blanched bone,"
9840,IV,"That cowers beside him, a thing as lone"
9841,IV,And white as the ice-isles of Northern seas
9842,IV,In the desolate horror of his disease.
9843,IV,
9844,IV,
9845,V,V
9846,V,
9847,V,"And Sir Launfal said, 'I behold in thee        280"

9849,V,"Thou also hast had thy crown of thorns,"
9850,V,"Thou also hast had the world's buffets and scorns,"

9859,VI,Then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes

9861,VI,Remembered in what a haughtier guise             290
9862,VI,"He had flung an alms to leprosie,"
9863,VI,When he girt his young life up in gilded mail
9864,VI,And set forth in search of the Holy Grail.
9865,VI,The heart within him was ashes and dust;
9866,VI,"He parted in twain his single crust,"
9867,VI,"He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,"
9868,VI,And gave the leper to eat and drink.
9869,VI,"'Twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread,"
9870,VI,"'Twas water out of a wooden bowl,--"
9871,VI,"Yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed,          300"
9872,VI,And 'twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul.

9874,VI,
9875,VII,VII
9876,VII,
9877,VII,"As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face,"

9879,VII,"The leper no longer crouched at his side,"
9880,VII,"But stood before him glorified,"
9881,VII,Shining and tall and fair and straight
9882,VII,"As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate,--"
9883,VII,Himself the Gate whereby men can
9884,VII,Enter the temple of God in Man.

9888,VIII,
9889,VIII,"His words were shed softer than leaves from the pine,     310"

9891,VIII,That mingle their softness and quiet in one
9892,VIII,With the shaggy unrest they float down upon;
9893,VIII,"And the voice that was softer than silence said,"
9894,VIII,"'Lo, it is I, be not afraid!"
9895,VIII,"In many climes, without avail,"
9896,VIII,Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;
9897,VIII,"Behold, it is here,--this cup which thou"
9898,VIII,Didst fill at the streamlet for me but now;
9899,VIII,"This crust is my body broken for thee,          320"
9900,VIII,This water his blood that died on the tree;
9901,VIII,"The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,"
9902,VIII,In whatso we share with another's need;
9903,VIII,"Not what we give, but what we share,"
9904,VIII,For the gift without the giver is bare;
9905,VIII,"Who gives himself with his alms feeds three,"

9913,IX,"Hang my idle armor up on the wall,        330"
9914,IX,Let it be the spider's banquet hall;

9926,X,"When the first poor outcast went in at the door,"
9927,X,"She entered with him in disguise,"
9928,X,And mastered the fortress by surprise;        341
9929,X,"There is no spot she loves so well on ground,"
9930,X,She lingers and smiles there the whole year round;
9931,X,The meanest serf on Sir Launfal's land
9932,X,Has hall and bower at his command;
9933,X,And there's no poor man in the North Countree
9934,X,But is lord of the earldom as much as he.

10414,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Phoebus, sitting one day in a laurel-tree's shade,"
10415,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Was reminded of Daphne, of whom it was made,"
10416,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For the god being one day too warm in his wooing,"
10417,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She took to the tree to escape his pursuing;
10418,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Be the cause what it might, from his offers she shrunk,"
10419,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, Ginevra-like, shut herself up in a trunk;"
10420,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, though 'twas a step into which he had driven her,"
10421,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He somehow or other had never forgiven her;
10422,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Her memory he nursed as a kind of a tonic,"
10423,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Something bitter to chew when he'd play the Byronic,      10"
10424,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And I can't count the obstinate nymphs that he brought over
10425,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By a strange kind of smile he put on when he thought of her.
10426,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'My case is like Dido's,' he sometimes remarked;"
10427,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'When I last saw my love, she was fairly embarked"
10428,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In a laurel, as _she_ thought--but (ah, how Fate mocks!)"
10429,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She has found it by this time a very bad box;
10430,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Let hunters from me take this saw when they need it,--"
10431,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You're not always sure of your game when you've treed it.
10432,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Just conceive such a change taking place in one's mistress!
10433,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What romance would be left?--who can flatter or kiss trees?      20
10434,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, for mercy's sake, how could one keep up a dialogue"
10435,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a dull wooden thing that will live and will die a log,--"
10436,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not to say that the thought would forever intrude
10437,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That you've less chance to win her the more she is wood?
10438,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ah! it went to my heart, and the memory still grieves,"
10439,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To see those loved graces all taking their leaves;
10440,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Those charms beyond speech, so enchanting but now,"
10441,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As they left me forever, each making its bough!"
10442,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If her tongue _had_ a tang sometimes more than was right,"
10443,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Her new bark is worse than ten times her old bite.'      30

10445,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, Daphne--before she was happily treeified--"
10446,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Over all other blossoms the lily had deified,"
10447,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And when she expected the god on a visit
10448,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"('Twas before he had made his intentions explicit),"
10449,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Some buds she arranged with a vast deal of care,"
10450,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To look as if artlessly twined in her hair,"
10451,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where they seemed, as he said, when he paid his addresses,"
10452,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like the day breaking through, the long night of her tresses;"
10453,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So whenever he wished to be quite irresistible,"
10454,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like a man with eight trumps in his hand at a whist-table      40

10456,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Though I might have lugged in an allusion to Cristabel),--"
10457,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He would take up a lily, and gloomily look in it,"

10460,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Well, here, after all the bad rhyme I've been spinning,"
10461,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I've got back at last to my story's beginning:
10462,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sitting there, as I say, in the shade of his mistress,"
10463,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As dull as a volume of old Chester mysteries,"
10464,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or as those puzzling specimens which, in old histories,"
10465,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"We read of his verses--the Oracles, namely,--    50"
10466,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(I wonder the Greeks should have swallowed them tamely,"
10467,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For one might bet safely whatever he has to risk,"
10468,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They were laid at his door by some ancient Miss Asterisk,"
10469,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And so dull that the men who retailed them out-doors

10471,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"First, he mused what the animal substance or herb is"
10472,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Would induce a mustache, for you know he's _imberbis;_"
10473,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then he shuddered to think how his youthful position
10474,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Was assailed by the age of his son the physician;
10475,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"At some poems he glanced, had been sent to him lately,      60"
10476,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And the metre and sentiment puzzled him greatly;
10477,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Mehercle! I'd make such proceeding felonious,--"
10478,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Have they all of them slept in the cave of Trophonius?
10479,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Look well to your seat, 'tis like taking an airing"
10480,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On a corduroy road, and that out of repairing;"
10481,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It leads one, 'tis true, through the primitive forest,"
10482,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Grand natural features, but then one has no rest;"
10483,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You just catch a glimpse of some ravishing distance,"
10484,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When a jolt puts the whole of it out of existence,--"
10485,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why not use their ears, if they happen to have any?'      70"
10486,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,--Here the laurel leaves murmured the name of poor Daphne.
10487,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10488,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Oh, weep with me, Daphne,' he sighed, 'for you know it's"
10489,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A terrible thing to be pestered with poets!
10490,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, alas, she is dumb, and the proverb holds good,"
10491,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,She never will cry till she's out of the wood!
10492,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What wouldn't I give if I never had known of her?
10493,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Twere a kind of relief had I something to groan over:
10494,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If I had but some letters of hers, now, to toss over,"
10495,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I might turn for the nonce a Byronic philosopher,"
10496,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And bewitch all the flats by bemoaning the loss of her.      80
10497,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One needs something tangible, though, to begin on,--"
10498,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A loom, as it were, for the fancy to spin on;"
10499,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What boots all your grist? it can never be ground
10500,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Till a breeze makes the arms of the windmill go round;
10501,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Or, if 'tis a water-mill, alter the metaphor,"
10502,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And say it won't stir, save the wheel be well wet afore,"
10503,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or lug in some stuff about water ""so dreamily,""--"
10504,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It is not a metaphor, though, 'tis a simile);"
10505,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A lily, perhaps, would set _my_ mill a-going,"
10506,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For just at this season, I think, they are blowing.      90"
10507,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Here, somebody, fetch one; not very far hence"
10508,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They're in bloom by the score, 'tis but climbing a fence;"
10509,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There's a poet hard by, who does nothing but fill his"
10510,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whole garden, from one end to t'other, with lilies;"
10511,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A very good plan, were it not for satiety,"
10512,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One longs for a weed here and there, for variety;"
10513,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Though a weed is no more than a flower in disguise,"
10514,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which is seen through at once, if love give a man eyes.'"
10515,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10516,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now there happened to be among Phoebus's followers,"
10517,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A gentleman, one of the omnivorous swallowers,      100"
10518,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who bolt every book that comes out of the press,"
10519,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Without the least question of larger or less,"
10520,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose stomachs are strong at the expense of their head,--"
10521,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For reading new books is like eating new bread,"
10522,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"One can bear it at first, but by gradual steps he"
10523,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is brought to death's door of a mental dyspepsy.
10524,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On a previous stage of existence, our Hero"
10525,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had ridden outside, with the glass below zero;"
10526,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He had been, 'tis a fact you may safely rely on,"
10527,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of a very old stock a most eminent scion,--     110"
10528,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A stock all fresh quacks their fierce boluses ply on,"

10537,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And at last choose the hard bed of honor to die on,      120"
10538,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose pedigree, traced to earth's earliest years,"
10539,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is longer than anything else but their ears,--"
10540,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In short, he was sent into life with the wrong key,"
10541,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He unlocked the door, and stept forth a poor donkey."
10542,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Though kicked and abused by his bipedal betters
10543,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Yet he filled no mean place in the kingdom of letters;
10544,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Far happier than many a literary hack,"
10545,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He bore only paper-mill rags on his back
10546,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(For It makes a vast difference which side the mill
10547,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One expends on the paper his labor and skill);      130

10549,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And Destiny balanced 'twixt this and that station,"
10550,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not having much time to expend upon bothers,"
10551,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Remembering he'd had some connection with authors,"

10553,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She set him on two, and he came forth a critic."
10554,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10555,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took
10556,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In any amusement but tearing a book;
10557,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For him there was no intermediate stage
10558,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From babyhood up to straight-laced middle age;      140
10559,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There were years when he didn't wear coat-tails behind,"
10560,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But a boy he could never be rightly defined;
10561,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"like the Irish Good Folk, though in length scarce a span,"
10562,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the womb he came gravely, a little old man;"
10563,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While other boys' trousers demanded the toil

10565,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Red, yellow, brown, black, clayey, gravelly, loamy,"
10566,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He sat in the corner and read Viri Romæ.
10567,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He never was known to unbend or to revel once
10568,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In base, marbles, hockey, or kick up the devil once;      150"
10569,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He was just one of those who excite the benevolence

10581,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In this way our Hero got safely to college,"

10590,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All the mystic and-so-forths contained in A.B.,"
10591,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He was launched (life is always compared to a sea)
10592,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With just enough learning, and skill for the using it,"
10593,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To prove he'd a brain, by forever confusing it."
10594,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So worthy St. Benedict, piously burning"

10600,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Each a separate fact, undeniably true,     180"
10601,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But with him or each other they'd nothing to do;
10602,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No power of combining, arranging, discerning,"
10603,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Digested the masses he learned into learning;
10604,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There was one thing in life he had practical knowledge for
10605,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(And this, you will think, he need scarce go to college for),--"
10606,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not a deed would he do, nor a word would he utter,"
10607,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Till he'd weighed its relations to plain bread and butter.
10608,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he left Alma Mater, he practised his wits"
10609,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In compiling the journals' historical bits,--"
10610,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of shops broken open, men falling in fits,     190"
10611,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Great fortunes in England bequeathed to poor printers,"
10612,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And cold spells, the coldest for many past winters,--"
10613,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then, rising by industry, knack, and address,"
10614,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Got notices up for an unbiased press,"
10615,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a mind so well poised, it seemed equally made for"
10616,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Applause or abuse, just which chanced to be paid for:"
10617,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From this point his progress was rapid and sure,"
10618,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the post of a regular heavy reviewer.
10619,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10620,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And here I must say he wrote excellent articles
10621,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"On Hebraical points, or the force of Greek particles;     200"
10622,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They filled up the space nothing else was prepared for,"
10623,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And nobody read that which nobody cared for;
10624,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If any old book reached a fiftieth edition,"
10625,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He could fill forty pages with safe erudition:
10626,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He could gauge the old books by the old set of rules,"
10627,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And his very old nothings pleased very old fools;
10628,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But give him a new book, fresh out of the heart,"
10629,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And you put him at sea without compass or chart,--"
10630,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His blunders aspired to the rank of an art;
10631,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For his lore was engraft, something foreign that grew in him,     210"
10632,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Exhausting the sap of the native and true in him,"
10633,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So that when a man came with a soul that was new in him,"
10634,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Carving new forms of truth out of Nature's old granite,"
10635,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"New and old at their birth, like Le Verrier's planet,"
10636,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, to get a true judgment, themselves must create"
10637,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the soul of their critic the measure and weight,"
10638,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Being rather themselves a fresh standard of grace,"
10639,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To compute their own judge, and assign him his place,"
10640,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Our reviewer would crawl all about it and round it,"
10641,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, reporting each circumstance just as he found it,     220"
10642,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Without the least malice,--his record would be"
10643,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Profoundly æsthetic as that of a flea,"
10644,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, supping on Wordsworth, should print for our sakes,"
10645,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Recollections of nights with the Bard of the Lakes,"
10646,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, lodged by an Arab guide, ventured to render a"
10647,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Comprehensive account of the ruins at Denderah.
10648,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10649,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As I said, he was never precisely unkind."
10650,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The defect in his brain was just absence of mind;
10651,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he boasted, 'twas simply that he was self-made,"
10652,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A position which I, for one, never gainsaid,     230"
10653,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My respect for my Maker supposing a skill
10654,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In his works which our Hero would answer but ill;
10655,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And I trust that the mould which he used may be cracked, or he,"
10656,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Made bold by success, may enlarge his phylactery,"
10657,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And set up a kind of a man-manufactory,--"
10658,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"An event which I shudder to think about, seeing"
10659,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That Man is a moral, accountable being."
10660,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10661,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He meant well enough, but was still in the way,"
10662,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As dunces still are, let them be where they may;"
10663,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Indeed, they appear to come into existence     240"
10664,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To impede other folks with their awkward assistance;
10665,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If you set up a dunce on the very North pole
10666,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All alone with himself, I believe, on my soul,"
10667,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He'd manage to get betwixt somebody's shins,"
10668,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And pitch him down bodily, all in his sins,"
10669,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the grave polar bears sitting round on the ice,"
10670,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All shortening their grace, to be in for a slice;"
10671,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, if he found nobody else there to pother,"
10672,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, one of his legs would just trip up the other,"
10673,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For there's nothing we read of in torture's inventions,     250"
10674,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like a well-meaning dunce, with the best of intentions."
10675,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10676,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A terrible fellow to meet in society,"
10677,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not the toast that he buttered was ever so dry at tea;
10678,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There he'd sit at the table and stir in his sugar,"
10679,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Crouching close for a spring, all the while, like a cougar;"
10680,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Be sure of your facts, of your measures and weights,"
10681,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of your time,--he's as fond as an Arab of dates;"
10682,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You'll be telling, perhaps, in your comical way,"
10683,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of something you've seen in the course of the day;
10684,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, just as you're tapering out the conclusion,     260"
10685,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You venture an ill-fated classic allusion,--"
10686,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The girls have all got their laughs ready, when, whack!"
10687,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The cougar comes down on your thunderstruck back!
10688,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You had left out a comma,--your Greek's put in joint,"
10689,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And pointed at cost of your story's whole point.
10690,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the course of the evening, you find chance for certain"
10691,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Soft speeches to Anne, in the shade of the curtain:"
10692,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You tell her your heart can be likened to _one_ flower,"
10693,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'And that, O most charming of women, 's the sunflower,"
10694,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which turns'--here a clear nasal voice, to your terror,     270"
10695,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From outside the curtain, says, 'That's all an error.'"
10696,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As for him, he's--no matter, he never grew tender,"
10697,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sitting after a ball, with his feet on the fender,"
10698,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Shaping somebody's sweet features out of cigar smoke
10699,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(Though he'd willingly grant you that such doings are smoke);
10700,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"All women he damns with _mutabile semper_,"
10701,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And if ever he felt something like love's distemper,"
10702,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Twas tow'rds a young lady who spoke ancient Mexican,"
10703,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And assisted her father in making a lexicon;
10704,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Though I recollect hearing him get quite ferocious      280
10705,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"About Mary Clausum, the mistress of Grotius,"
10706,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or something of that sort,--but, no more to bore ye"
10707,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With character-painting, I'll turn to my story."
10708,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10709,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, Apollo, who finds it convenient sometimes"
10710,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To get his court clear of the makers of rhymes,"
10711,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The _genus_, I think it is called, _irritabile_,"
10712,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Every one of whom thinks himself treated most shabbily,"
10713,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And nurses a--what is it?--_immedicabile_,"
10714,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which keeps him at boiling-point, hot for a quarrel,"
10715,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As bitter as wormwood, and sourer than sorrel,      290"
10716,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If any poor devil but look at a laurel;--
10717,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Apollo, I say, being sick of their rioting"
10718,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(Though he sometimes acknowledged their verse had a quieting
10719,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Effect after dinner, and seemed to suggest a"
10720,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Retreat to the shrine of a tranquil siesta),"
10721,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Kept our Hero at hand, who, by means of a bray,"
10722,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which he gave to the life, drove the rabble away;"
10723,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And if that wouldn't do, he was sure to succeed,"
10724,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he took his review out and offered to read;
10725,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, failing in plans of this milder description,      300"
10726,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He would ask for their aid to get up a subscription,"
10727,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Considering that authorship wasn't a rich craft,"
10728,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To print the 'American drama of Witchcraft.'
10729,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Stay, I'll read you a scene,'--but he hardly began,"
10730,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Ere Apollo shrieked 'Help!' and the authors all ran:
10731,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And once, when these purgatives acted with less spirit,"
10732,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the desperate case asked a remedy desperate,"
10733,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He drew from his pocket a foolscap epistle
10734,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As calmly as if 'twere a nine-barrelled pistol,"
10735,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And threatened them all with the judgment to come,      310"
10736,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of 'A wandering Star's first impressions of Rome.'
10737,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Stop! stop!' with their hands o'er their ears, screamed the Muses,"
10738,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'He may go off and murder himself, if he chooses,"
10739,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Twas a means self-defence only sanctioned his trying,"

10742,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Give us each a large handkerchief soaked in strong ether.'
10743,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10744,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I called this a 'Fable for Critics;' you think it's
10745,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,More like a display of my rhythmical trinkets;
10746,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"My plot, like an icicle's slender and slippery,      320"
10747,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Every moment more slender, and likely to slip awry,"
10748,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And the reader unwilling _in loco desipere_
10749,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is free to jump over as much of my frippery
10750,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As he fancies, and, if he's a provident skipper, he"
10751,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"May have like Odysseus control of the gales,"
10752,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And get safe to port, ere his patience quite fails;"
10753,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Moreover, although 'tis a slender return"
10754,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For your toil and expense, yet my paper will burn,"
10755,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, if you have manfully struggled thus far with me,"
10756,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You may e'en twist me up, and just light your cigar with me:      330"
10757,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If too angry for that, you can tear me in pieces,"
10758,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And my _membra disjecta_ consign to the breezes,"
10759,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A fate like great Ratzau's, whom one of those bores,"
10760,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who beflead with bad verses poor Louis Quatorze,"
10761,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Describes (the first verse somehow ends with _victoire_),"
10762,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As _dispersant partout et ses membres et sa gloire;_
10763,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Or, if I were over-desirous of earning"
10764,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A repute among noodles for classical learning,"
10765,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I could pick you a score of allusions, i-wis,"
10766,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As new as the jests of _Didaskalos tis;_      340
10767,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Better still, I could make out a good solid list"
10768,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From authors recondite who do not exist,--"
10769,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But that would be naughty: at least, I could twist"
10770,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Something out of Absyrtus, or turn your inquiries"
10771,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After Milton's prose metaphor, drawn from Osiris;"
10772,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, as Cicero says he won't say this or that"
10773,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(A fetch, I must say, most transparent and flat),"
10774,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After saying whate'er he could possibly think of,--"
10775,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I simply will state that I pause on the brink of
10776,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A mire, ankle-deep, of deliberate confusion,      350"
10777,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Made up of old jumbles of classic allusion:
10778,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, when you were thinking yourselves to be pitied,"
10779,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just conceive how much harder your teeth you'd have gritted,"
10780,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,An 'twere not for the dulness I've kindly omitted.
10781,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10782,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I'd apologize here for my many digressions.
10783,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Were it not that I'm certain to trip into fresh ones
10784,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,('Tis so hard to escape if you get in their mesh once);
10785,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just reflect, if you please, how 'tis said by Horatius,"
10786,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That Mæonides nods now and then, and, my gracious!"
10787,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,It certainly does look a little bit ominous      360
10788,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When he gets under way with _ton d'apameibomenos_.
10789,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Here a something occurs which I'll just clap a rhyme to,"
10790,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And say it myself, ere a Zoilus have time to,--"
10791,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Any author a nap like Van Winkle's may take,"
10792,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he only contrive to keep readers awake,"
10793,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But he'll very soon find himself laid on the shelf,"
10794,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If _they_ fall a-nodding when he nods himself.)
10795,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10796,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Once for all, to return, and to stay, will I, nill I--"
10797,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When Phoebus expressed his desire for a lily,"
10798,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Our Hero, whose homoeopathic sagacity          370"
10799,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With an ocean of zeal mixed his drop of capacity,"
10800,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Set off for the garden as fast as the wind
10801,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Or, to take a comparison more to my mind,"
10802,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As a sound politician leaves conscience behind).
10803,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And leaped the low fence, as a party hack jumps"
10804,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O'er his principles, when something else turns up trumps."
10805,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10806,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He was gone a long time, and Apollo, meanwhile,"
10807,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Went over some sonnets of his with a file,"
10808,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For, of all compositions, he thought that the sonnet"
10809,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Best repaid all the toil you expended upon it;      380
10810,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It should reach with one impulse the end of its course,"
10811,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And for one final blow collect all of its force;
10812,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not a verse should be salient, but each one should tend"
10813,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With a wave-like up-gathering to break at the end;
10814,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, condensing the strength here, there smoothing a wry kink,"
10815,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He was killing the time, when up walked Mr. D----,"
10816,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"At a few steps behind him, a small man in glasses"
10817,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Went dodging about, muttering, 'Murderers! asses!'"
10818,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From out of his pocket a paper he'd take,"
10819,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a proud look of martyrdom tied to its stake,      390"
10820,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, reading a squib at himself, he'd say, 'Here I see"
10821,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Gainst American letters a bloody conspiracy,"

10825,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of spite at my zeal on the Copyright question,"
10826,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For, on this side the water, 'tis prudent to pull"
10827,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O'er the eyes of the public their national wool,"
10828,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By accusing of slavish respect to John Bull

10832,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of some twopenny editor over the seas,"
10833,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And licking his critical shoes, for you know 'tis"
10834,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The whole aim of our lives to get one English notice;

10836,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(They're all from one source, monthly, weekly, diurnal)"
10837,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To get but a kick from a transmarine journal!'

10841,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He came cautiously on, peeping round every corner,"
10842,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And into each hole where a weasel might pass in,"
10843,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Expecting the knife of some critic assassin,"
10844,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Who stabs to the heart with a caricature.
10845,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not so bad as those daubs of the Sun, to be sure,"
10846,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet done with a dagger-o'-type, whose vile portraits"
10847,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Disperse all one's good and condense all one's poor traits.

10882,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now nobody knows when an author is hit,"
10883,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he have not a public hysterical fit;
10884,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Let him only keep close in his snug garret's dim ether,      450"
10885,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And nobody'd think of his foes--or of him either;
10886,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If an author have any least fibre of worth in him,"
10887,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Abuse would but tickle the organ of mirth in him;
10888,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,All the critics on earth cannot crush with their ban
10889,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One word that's in tune with the nature of man.'

10892,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Into which if you'll just have the goodness to look,"
10893,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You may feel so delighted (when once you are through it)
10894,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As to deem it not unworth your while to review it,"
10895,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And I think I can promise your thoughts, if you do,      460"

10897,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10898,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'The most thankless of gods you must surely have thought me,"
10899,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For this is the forty-fourth copy you've brought me;
10900,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I have given them away, or at least I have tried,"
10901,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But I've forty-two left, standing all side by side"
10902,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(The man who accepted that one copy died),--"
10903,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From one end of a shelf to the other they reach,"
10904,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""With the author's respects"" neatly written in each."
10905,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The publisher, sure, will proclaim a Te Deum,"
10906,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When he hears of that order the British Museum      470
10907,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has sent for one set of what books were first printed
10908,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In America, little or big,--for 'tis hinted"
10909,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That this is the first truly tangible hope he
10910,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has ever had raised for the sale of a copy.
10911,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I've thought very often 'twould be a good thing
10912,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In all public collections of books, if a wing"
10913,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Were set off by itself, like the seas from the dry lands,"
10914,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Marked _Literature suited to desolate islands_,"
10915,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And filled with such books as could never be read
10916,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Save by readers of proofs, forced to do it for bread,--     480"
10917,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such books as one's wrecked on in small country taverns,"
10918,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as hermits might mortify over in caverns,"
10919,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as Satan, if printing had then been invented,"
10920,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As the climax of woe, would to Job have presented."
10921,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Such as Crusoe might dip in, although there are few so"
10922,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Outrageously cornered by fate as poor Crusoe;
10923,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And since the philanthropists just now are banging

10932,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A bait to draw saints from their spiritual weal,"
10933,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And regards the quadrille as a far greater knavery
10934,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Than crushing his African children with slavery,--"
10935,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Since all who take part in a waltz or cotillon
10936,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are mounted for hell on the Devil's own pillion,      500"
10937,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who, as every true orthodox Christian well knows,"
10938,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Approaches the heart through the door of the toes,--"
10939,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That He, I was saying, whose judgments are stored"
10940,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For such as take steps in despite of his word,"
10941,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Should look with delight on the agonized prancing

10947,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now, instead of all this, I think I can direct you all      511"
10948,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To a criminal code both humane and effectual;--
10949,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I propose to shut up every doer of wrong
10950,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With these desperate books, for such term, short or long,"
10951,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As, by statute in such cases made and provided,"
10952,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Shall be by your wise legislators decided:
10953,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Thus: Let murderers be shut, to grow wiser and cooler,"
10954,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At hard labor for life on the works of Miss----;
10955,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Petty thieves, kept from flagranter crimes by their fears,"
10956,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Shall peruse Yankee Doodle a blank term of years,--    520"
10957,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That American Punch, like the English, no doubt,--"
10958,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Just the sugar and lemons and spirit left out.

10960,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'But stay, here comes Tityrus Griswold, and leads on"
10961,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The flocks whom he first plucks alive, and then feeds on,--"
10962,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A loud-cackling swarm, in whose leathers warm drest,"

10966,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on,"
10967,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose prose is grand verse, while his verse, the Lord knows,"
10968,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is some of it pr---- No, 'tis not even prose;      530"
10969,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I'm speaking of metres; some poems have welled
10970,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From those rare depths of soul that have ne'er been excelled;
10971,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They're not epics, but that doesn't matter a pin,"
10972,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In creating, the only hard thing's to begin;"
10973,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A grass-blade's no easier to make than an oak;

10975,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,"

10978,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Makes a poem, but rather the general tone,       540"
10979,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The something pervading, uniting the whole,"
10980,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The before unconceived, unconceivable soul,"
10981,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So that just in removing this trifle or that, you"
10982,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Take away, as it were, a chief limb of the statue;"
10983,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Roots, wood, bark, and leaves singly perfect may be,"
10984,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, clapt hodge-podge together, they don't make a tree."
10985,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
10986,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'But, to come back to Emerson (whom, by the way,"
10987,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I believe we left waiting),--his is, we may say,"

10989,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Has Olympus for one pole, for t'other the Exchange;      550"
10990,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He seems, to my thinking (although I'm afraid"
10991,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The comparison must, long ere this, have been made),"
10992,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A Plotinus-Montaigne, where the Egyptian's gold mist"

11000,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In whose mind all creation is duly respected
11001,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As parts of himself--just a little projected;

11003,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A convert to--nothing but Emerson.
11004,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So perfect a balance there is in his head,"
11005,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That he talks of things sometimes as if they were dead;
11006,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Life, nature, love, God, and affairs of that sort,"
11007,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He looks at as merely ideas; in short,"
11008,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As if they were fossils stuck round in a cabinet,"
11009,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of such vast extent that our earth's a mere dab in it;      570

11014,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the quiet precision of science he'll sort 'em,"

11020,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Carlyle's the more burly, but E. is the rarer;      580"
11021,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He sees fewer objects, but clearlier, truelier,"
11022,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If C.'s as original, E.'s more peculiar;"

11027,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The one's two thirds Norseman, the other half Greek,"

11029,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"C.'s generals require to be seen in the mass,--"

11031,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"C. gives nature and God his own fits of the blues,"

11033,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"E. sits in a mystery calm and intense,"
11034,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And looks coolly around him with sharp common-sense;
11035,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,C. shows you how every-day matters unite
11036,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the dim transdiurnal recesses of night,--"
11037,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While E., in a plain, preternatural way,"
11038,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Makes mysteries matters of mere every day;

11040,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not sketching their bundles of muscles and thews illy,      600"
11041,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He paints with a brush so untamed and profuse,"

11043,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"E. is rather like Flaxman, lines strait and severe,"
11044,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And a colorless outline, but full, round, and clear;--"
11045,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the men he thinks worthy he frankly accords
11046,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The design of a white marble statue in words.
11047,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"C. labors to get at the centre, and then"

11049,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"E. calmly assumes the said centre as granted,"
11050,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, given himself, has whatever is wanted.      610"

11052,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'He has imitators in scores, who omit"

11054,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who go carefully o'er the sky-blue of his brain,"
11055,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And when he has skimmed it once, skim it again;"
11056,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If at all they resemble him, you may be sure it is"
11057,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Because their shoals mirror his mists and obscurities,"
11058,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As a mud-puddle seems deep as heaven for a minute,"
11059,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,While a cloud that floats o'er is reflected within it.

11066,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His fingers exploring the prophet's each pocket.
11067,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Fie, for shame, brother bard; with good fruit of your own,"
11068,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Can't you let Neighbor Emerson's orchards alone?
11069,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Besides, 'tis no use, you'll not find e'en a core,--"

11071,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They might strip every tree, and E. never would catch 'em,"
11072,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His Hesperides have no rude dragon to watch 'em;      630
11073,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When they send him a dishful, and ask him to try 'em,"
11074,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He never suspects how the sly rogues came by 'em;
11075,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He wonders why 'tis there are none such his trees on,"
11076,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And thinks 'em the best he has tasted this season.

11078,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Yonder, calm as a cloud, Alcott stalks in a dream,"
11079,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And fancies himself in thy groves, Academe,"
11080,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the Parthenon nigh, and the olive-trees o'er him,"
11081,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And never a fact to perplex him or bore him,"
11082,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a snug room at Plato's when night comes, to walk to,"

11084,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And from midnight till morning, nor snore in their listening;--"
11085,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So he muses, his face with the joy of it glistening,"
11086,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For his highest conceit of a happiest state is
11087,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where they'd live upon acorns, and hear him talk gratis;"
11088,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And indeed, I believe, no man ever talked better,--"
11089,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter;
11090,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He seems piling words, but there's royal dust hid"

11092,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While he talks he is great, but goes out like a taper,"
11093,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If you shut him up closely with pen, ink, and paper;      650"
11094,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet his fingers itch for 'em from morning till night,"
11095,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And he thinks he does wrong if he don't always write;
11096,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In this, as in all things, a lamb among men,"

11115,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The worst of it is, that his logic's so strong,"
11116,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That of two sides he commonly chooses the wrong;
11117,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If there is only one, why, he'll split it in two,"
11118,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And first pummel this half, then that, black and blue."

11130,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose,"

11136,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yet whenever it slips away free and unlaced,"
11137,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It runs like a stream with a musical waste,"

11142,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For some one to be slightly shallow's a duty,"
11143,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And Willis's shallowness makes half his beauty.
11144,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His prose winds along with a blithe, gurgling error,"

11155,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Breezes waiting to turn every leaf of your book over,      710"
11156,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And Nature to criticise still as you read,--"
11157,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The page that bears that is a rare one indeed.
11158,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11159,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'He's so innate a cockney, that had he been born"
11160,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where plain bare-skin's the only full-dress that is worn,"
11161,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He'd have given his own such an air that you'd say
11162,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'T had been made by a tailor to lounge in Broadway.
11163,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His nature's a glass of champagne with the foam on 't,"
11164,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As tender as Fletcher, as witty as Beaumont;"
11165,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,So his best things are done in the flush of the moment;
11166,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he wait, all is spoiled; he may stir it and shake it,      720"
11167,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, the fixed air once gone, he can never re-make it."
11168,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He might be a marvel of easy delightfulness,"
11169,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If he would not sometimes leave the _r_ out of sprightfulness;
11170,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he ought to let Scripture alone--'tis self-slaughter,"
11171,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For nobody likes inspiration-and-water.
11172,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He'd have been just the fellow to sup at the Mermaid,"
11173,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Cracking jokes at rare Ben, with an eye to the barmaid,"
11174,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His wit running up as Canary ran down,--"
11175,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The topmost bright bubble on the wave of The Town.
11176,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11177,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Here comes Parker, the Orson of parsons, a man      730"
11178,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Whom the Church undertook to put under her ban
11179,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(The Church of Socinus, I mean),--his opinions"
11180,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Being So-(ultra)-cinian, they shocked the Socinians:"
11181,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They believed--faith, I'm puzzled--I think I may call"
11182,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Their belief a believing in nothing at all,"
11183,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or something of that sort; I know they all went
11184,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For a general union of total dissent:
11185,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He went a step farther; without cough or hem,"
11186,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He frankly avowed he believed not in them;
11187,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, before he could be jumbled up or prevented,      740"
11188,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From their orthodox kind of dissent he dissented.
11189,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There was heresy here, you perceive, for the right"
11190,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of privately judging means simply that light
11191,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Has been granted to _me_, for deciding on _you;_"
11192,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And in happier times, before Atheism grew,"
11193,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The deed contained clauses for cooking you too:

11195,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the same wave is wet that mocked Xerxes and Knut,"
11196,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And we all entertain a secure private notion,"
11197,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That our _Thus far!_ will have a great weight with the ocean,"
11198,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Twas so with our liberal Christians: they bore      751
11199,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;
11200,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They brandished their worn theological birches,"
11201,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Bade natural progress keep out of the Churches,"
11202,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And expected the lines they had drawn to prevail
11203,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With the fast-rising tide to keep out of their pale;
11204,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They had formerly dammed the Pontifical See,"
11205,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the same thing, they thought, would do nicely for P.;"
11206,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But he turned up his nose at their mumming and shamming,"
11207,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And cared (shall I say?) not a d---- for their damming;      760
11208,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So they first read him out of their church, and next minute"
11209,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Turned round and declared he had never been in it.
11210,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the ban was too small or the man was too big,"
11211,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For he recks not their bells, books, and candles a fig"
11212,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(He scarce looks like a man who would _stay_ treated shabbily,"
11213,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Sophroniscus' son's head o'er the features of Rabelais);--
11214,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He bangs and bethwacks them,--their backs he salutes"
11215,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With the whole tree of knowledge torn up by the roots;
11216,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His sermons with satire are plenteously verjuiced,"
11217,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he talks in one breath of Confutzee, Cass, Zerduscht,      770"
11218,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Jack Robinson, Peter the Hermit, Strap, Dathan,"

11234,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If in that day's discourse they'll be Bibled or Koraned,"
11235,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For he's seized the idea (by his martyrdom fired)
11236,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That all men (not orthodox) _may be_ inspired;

11243,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, to make a clean breast, that 'tis perfectly plain"

11248,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There's a background of god to each hard-working feature,"
11249,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Every word that he speaks has been fierily furnaced
11250,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In the blast of a life that has struggled in earnest:
11251,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There he stands, looking more like a ploughman than priest,"
11252,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If not dreadfully awkward, not graceful at least,"
11253,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His gestures all downright and same, if you will,"
11254,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As of brown-fisted Hobnail in hoeing a drill;
11255,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But his periods fall on you, stroke after stroke,"
11256,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like the blows of a lumberer felling an oak,"
11257,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You forget the man wholly, you're thankful to meet      810"
11258,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With a preacher who smacks of the field and the street,"

11262,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'There is Bryant, as quiet, as cool, and as dignified,"
11263,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As a smooth, silent iceberg, that never is ignified,"
11264,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Save when by reflection 'tis kindled o' nights
11265,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Lights.
11266,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He may rank (Griswold says so) first bard of your nation

11268,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Your topmost Parnassus he may set his heel on,      820"
11269,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But no warm applauses come, peal following peal on,--"
11270,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He's too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on:
11271,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Unqualified merits, I'll grant, if you choose, he has 'em,"
11272,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm;
11273,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he stir you at all, it is just, on my soul,"
11274,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like being stirred up with the very North Pole.
11275,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11276,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'He is very nice reading in summer, but _inter"

11278,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Take him up in the depth of July, my advice is,"
11279,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When you feel an Egyptian devotion to ices.      830
11280,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, deduct all you can, there's enough that's right good in him,"
11281,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has a true soul for field, river, and wood in him;"
11282,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And his heart, in the midst of brick walls, or where'er it is,"
11283,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Glows, softens, and thrills with the tenderest charities--"
11284,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To you mortals that delve in this trade-ridden planet?
11285,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No, to old Berkshire's hills, with their limestone and granite."
11286,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If you're one who _in loco_ (add _foco_ here) _desipis_,"
11287,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You will get out of his outermost heart (as I guess) a piece;
11288,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But you'd get deeper down if you came as a precipice,"
11289,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And would break the last seal of its inwardest fountain,      840"
11290,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If you only could palm yourself off for a mountain.
11291,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Mr. Quivis, or somebody quite as discerning,"
11292,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Some scholar who's hourly expecting his learning,"
11293,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Calls B. the American Wordsworth; but Wordsworth
11294,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,May be rated at more than your whole tuneful herd's worth.
11295,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No, don't be absurd, he's an excellent Bryant;"
11296,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, my friends, you'll endanger the life of your client,"
11297,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,By attempting to stretch him up into a giant;
11298,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If you choose to compare him, I think there are two per-"
11299,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,-sons fit for a parallel--Thomson and Cowper;[2]      850
11300,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I don't mean exactly,--there's something of each,"
11301,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There's T.'s love of nature, C.'s penchant to preach;"
11302,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Just mix up their minds so that C.'s spice of craziness
11303,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Shall balance and neutralize T.'s turn for laziness,"
11304,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And it gives you a brain cool, quite frictionless, quiet,"
11305,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose internal police nips the buds of all riot,--"
11306,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A brain like a permanent strait-jacket put on
11307,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The heart that strives vainly to burst off a button,--"
11308,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A brain which, without being slow or mechanic,"
11309,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Does more than a larger less drilled, more volcanic;      860"
11310,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He's a Cowper condensed, with no craziness bitten,"
11311,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And the advantage that Wordsworth before him had written.
11312,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11313,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'But, my dear little bardlings, don't prick up your ears"
11314,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Nor suppose I would rank you and Bryant as peers;
11315,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If I call him an iceberg, I don't mean to say"
11316,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There is nothing in that which is grand in its way;
11317,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He is almost the one of your poets that knows
11318,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How much grace, strength, and dignity lie in Repose;"
11319,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he sometimes fall short, he is too wise to mar"
11320,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His thought's modest fulness by going too far;      870
11321,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'T would be well if your authors should all make a trial
11322,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of what virtue there is in severe self-denial,"
11323,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And measure their writings by Hesiod's staff,"
11324,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Which teaches that all has less value than half.
11325,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11326,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'There is Whittier, whose swelling and vehement heart"
11327,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Strains the strait-breasted drab of the Quaker apart,"
11328,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And reveals the live Man, still supreme and erect,"
11329,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Underneath the bemummying wrappers of sect;
11330,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There was ne'er a man born who had more of the swing
11331,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the true lyric bard and all that kind of thing;      880
11332,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And his failures arise (though he seem not to know it)
11333,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the very same cause that has made him a poet,--"
11334,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A fervor of mind which knows no separation
11335,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Twixt simple excitement and pure inspiration,"
11336,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As my Pythoness erst sometimes erred from not knowing
11337,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If 'twere I or mere wind through her tripod was blowing;
11338,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Let his mind once get head in its favorite direction
11339,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the torrent of verse bursts the dams of reflection,"
11340,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While, borne with the rush of the metre along,"
11341,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The poet may chance to go right or go wrong,      890"
11342,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Content with the whirl and delirium of song;
11343,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then his grammar's not always correct, nor his rhymes,"
11344,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he's prone to repeat his own lyrics sometimes,"
11345,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not his best, though, for those are struck off at white-heats"
11346,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When the heart in his breast like a trip-hammer beats,"
11347,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And can ne'er be repeated again any more
11348,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Than they could have been carefully plotted before:
11349,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like old what's-his-name there at the battle of Hastings

11360,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With the smoothest of pebbles from Castaly's spring
11361,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Impressed on his hard moral sense with a sling?      910

11377,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Your calling them cut-throats and knaves all day long

11383,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You need not look shy at your sisters and brothers

11697,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In the weight of cold lead they respectively carry.
11698,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The smooth-bore is one in whose essence the mind
11699,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Not a corner nor cranny to cling by can find;
11700,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You feel as in nightmares sometimes, when you slip"
11701,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Down a steep slated roof, where there's nothing to grip;"
11702,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You slide and you slide, the blank horror increases,--"
11703,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You had rather by far be at once smashed to pieces;
11704,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You fancy a whirlpool below white and frothing,"
11705,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And finally drop off and light upon--nothing.      1240
11706,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The screw-bore has twists in him, faint predilections"
11707,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For going just wrong in the tritest directions;
11708,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he's wrong he is flat, when he's right he can't show it,"
11709,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He'll tell you what Snooks said about the new poet,[3]"
11710,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or how Fogrum was outraged by Tennyson's Princess;
11711,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He has spent all his spare time and intellect since his
11712,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Birth in perusing, on each art and science,"
11713,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just the books in which no one puts any reliance,"
11714,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And though _nemo_, we're told, _horis omnibus sapit_,"
11715,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The rule will not fit him, however you shape it,      1250"
11716,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For he has a perennial foison of sappiness;
11717,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has just enough force to spoil half your day's happiness,"
11718,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to make him a sort of mosquito to be with,"
11719,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But just not enough to dispute or agree with.
11720,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11721,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,These sketches I made (not to be too explicit)
11722,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From two honest fellows who made me a visit,"
11723,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And broke, like the tale of the Bear and the Fiddle,"
11724,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My reflections on Halleck short off by the middle;
11725,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I sha'n't now go into the subject more deeply,"
11726,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For I notice that some of my readers look sleep'ly;      1260
11727,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I will barely remark that, 'mongst civilized nations,"
11728,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There's none that displays more exemplary patience
11729,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Under all sorts of boring, at all sorts of hours,"
11730,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From all sorts of desperate persons, than ours."
11731,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not to speak of our papers, our State legislatures,"
11732,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And other such trials for sensitive natures,"
11733,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just look for a moment at Congress,--appalled,"
11734,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,My fancy shrinks back from the phantom it called;
11735,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, there's scarcely a member unworthy to frown"
11736,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Neath what Fourier nicknames the Boreal crown;         1270
11737,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Only think what that infinite bore-pow'r could do
11738,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If applied with a utilitarian view;
11739,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Suppose, for example, we shipped it with care"
11740,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To Sahara's great desert and let it bore there;
11741,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If they held one short session and did nothing else,"
11742,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They'd fill the whole waste with Artesian wells.
11743,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But 'tis time now with pen phonographic to follow
11744,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Through some more of his sketches our laughing Apollo:--
11745,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11746,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'There comes Harry Franco, and, as he draws near,"
11747,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You find that's a smile which you took for a sneer;      1280
11748,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One half of him contradicts t'other; his wont
11749,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is to say very sharp things and do very blunt;
11750,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His manner's as hard as his feelings are tender,"
11751,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And a _sortie_ he'll make when he means to surrender;
11752,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He's in joke half the time when he seems to be sternest,"
11753,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When he seems to be joking, be sure he's in earnest;"
11754,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has common sense in a way that's uncommon,"
11755,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Hates humbug and cant, loves his friends like a woman,"
11756,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Builds his dislikes of cards and his friendships of oak,"
11757,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Loves a prejudice better than aught but a joke,         1290"
11758,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is half upright Quaker, half downright Come-outer,"
11759,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Loves Freedom too well to go stark mad about her,"
11760,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Quite artless himself, is a lover of Art,"
11761,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Shuts you out of his secrets, and into his heart,"
11762,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And though not a poet, yet all must admire"
11763,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,In his letters of Pinto his skill on the liar.
11764,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11765,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'There comes Poe, with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge,"
11766,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Three fifths of him genius and two fifths sheer fudge,"
11767,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters,"
11768,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In a way to make people of common sense damn metres,      1300"
11769,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who has written some things quite the best of their kind,"
11770,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind,"
11771,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who--But hey-day! What's this? Messieurs Mathews and Poe,"
11772,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You mustn't fling mud-balls at Longfellow so,"
11773,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Does it make a man worse that his character's such
11774,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As to make his friends love him (as you think) too much?
11775,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, there is not a bard at this moment alive"
11776,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,More willing than he that his fellows should thrive;
11777,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While you are abusing him thus, even now"
11778,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He would help either one of you out of a slough;      1310
11779,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You may say that he's smooth and all that till you're hoarse,"
11780,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But remember that elegance also is force;
11781,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After polishing granite as much as you will,"
11782,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The heart keeps its tough old persistency still;
11783,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Deduct all you can, _that_ still keeps you at bay;"
11784,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, he'll live till men weary of Collins and Gray."
11785,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I'm not over-fond of Greek metres in English,"
11786,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To me rhyme's a gain, so it be not too jinglish,"
11787,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And your modern hexameter verses are no more
11788,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like Greek ones than sleek Mr. Pope is like Homer;      1320
11789,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As the roar of the sea to the coo of a pigeon is,"
11790,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, compared to your moderns, sounds old Melesigenes;"
11791,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I may be too partial, the reason, perhaps, o't is"
11792,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That I've heard the old blind man recite his own rhapsodies,"
11793,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And my ear with that music impregnate may be,"
11794,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Like the poor exiled shell with the soul of the sea,"
11795,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Or as one can't bear Strauss when his nature is cloven
11796,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To its deeps within deeps by the stroke of Beethoven;
11797,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, set that aside, and 'tis truth that I speak,"
11798,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had Theocritus written in English, not Greek,      1330"
11799,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I believe that his exquisite sense would scarce change a line
11800,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In that rare, tender, virgin-like pastoral Evangeline."
11801,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That's not ancient nor modern, its place is apart"
11802,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where time has no sway, in the realm of pure Art,"
11803,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Tis a shrine of retreat from Earth's hubbub and strife
11804,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As quiet and chaste as the author's own life.
11805,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11806,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"There comes Philothea, her face all aglow,"
11807,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She has just been dividing some poor creature's woe,"
11808,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And can't tell which pleases her most, to relieve"
11809,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His want, or his story to hear and believe;      1340"
11810,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No doubt against many deep griefs she prevails,"
11811,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For her ear is the refuge of destitute tales;
11812,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She knows well that silence is sorrow's best food,"
11813,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And that talking draws off from the heart its black blood,"
11814,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,So she'll listen with patience and let you unfold
11815,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Your bundle of rags as 'twere pure cloth of gold,"
11816,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, indeed, it all turns to as soon as she's touched it,"
11817,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And (to borrow a phrase from the nursery) _muched_ it;
11818,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She has such a musical taste, she will go"
11819,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Any distance to hear one who draws a long bow;      1350
11820,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She will swallow a wonder by mere might and main,"
11821,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And thinks it Geometry's fault if she's fain
11822,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To consider things flat, inasmuch as they're plain;"
11823,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Facts with her are accomplished, as Frenchmen would say--"
11824,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They will prove all she wishes them to either way,--"
11825,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, as fact lies on this side or that, we must try,"
11826,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If we're seeking the truth, to find where it don't lie;"
11827,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I was telling her once of a marvellous aloe
11828,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That for thousands of years had looked spindling and sallow,"
11829,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, though nursed by the fruitfullest powers of mud,      1360"
11830,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had never vouchsafed e'en so much as a bud,"
11831,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Till its owner remarked (as a sailor, you know,"
11832,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Often will in a calm) that it never would blow,"
11833,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For he wished to exhibit the plant, and designed"
11834,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That its blowing should help him in raising the wind;
11835,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At last it was told him that if he should water
11836,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Its roots with the blood of his unmarried daughter
11837,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Who was born, as her mother, a Calvinist, said,"
11838,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With William Law's serious caul on her head),"
11839,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,It would blow as the obstinate breeze did when by a      1370
11840,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like decree of her father died Iphigenia;
11841,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,At first he declared he himself would be blowed
11842,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ere his conscience with such a foul crime he would load,"
11843,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the thought, coming oft, grew less dark than before,"
11844,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he mused, as each creditor knocked at his door,"
11845,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If _this_ were but done they would dun me no more;
11846,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told Philothea his struggles and doubts,"
11847,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And how he considered the ins and the outs
11848,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of the visions he had, and the dreadful dyspepsy,"
11849,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How he went to the seër that lives at Po'keepsie,      1380"
11850,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"How the seër advised him to sleep on it first,"
11851,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to read his big volume in case of the worst,"
11852,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And further advised he should pay him five dollars
11853,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For writing [Old English: Hum Hum] on his wristbands and collars;
11854,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Three years and ten days these dark words he had studied
11855,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When the daughter was missed, and the aloe had budded;"
11856,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told how he watched it grow large and more large,"
11857,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And wondered how much for the show he should charge,--"
11858,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She had listened with utter indifference to this, till"
11859,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I told how it bloomed, and, discharging its pistil      1390"
11860,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With an aim the Eumenides dictated, shot"
11861,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The botanical filicide dead on the spot;
11862,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"It had blown, but he reaped not his horrible gains,"
11863,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For it blew with such force as to blow out his brains,"
11864,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the crime was blown also, because on the wad,"
11865,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which was paper, was writ ""Visitation of God,"""
11866,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As well as a thrilling account of the deed
11867,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Which the coroner kindly allowed me to read.
11868,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11869,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Well, my friend took this story up just, to be sure,      1399"
11870,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As one might a poor foundling that's laid at one's door;
11871,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She combed it and washed it and clothed it and fed it,"
11872,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And as if 'twere her own child most tenderly bred it,"
11873,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Laid the scene (of the legend, I mean) far away a-"
11874,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"-mong the green vales underneath Himalaya,"
11875,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And by artist-like touches, laid on here and there,"
11876,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Made the whole thing so touching, I frankly declare"
11877,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I have read it all thrice, and, perhaps I am weak,"
11878,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But I found every time there were tears on my cheek.
11879,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11880,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'The pole, science tells us, the magnet controls,"
11881,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But she is a magnet to emigrant Poles,               1410"
11882,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And folks with a mission that nobody knows
11883,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Throng thickly about her as bees round a rose;
11884,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She can fill up the _carets_ in such, make their scope"
11885,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Converge to some focus of rational hope,"
11886,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, with sympathies fresh as the morning, their gall"
11887,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Can transmute into honey,--but this is not all;"
11888,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not only for those she has solace, oh say,"
11889,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Vice's desperate nursling adrift in Broadway,"
11890,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who clingest, with all that is left of thee human,"
11891,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the last slender spar from the wreck of the woman,      1420"
11892,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Hast thou not found one shore where those tired drooping feet
11893,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Could reach firm mother-earth, one full heart on whose beat"
11894,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The soothed head in silence reposing could hear
11895,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The chimes of far childhood throb back on the ear?
11896,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Ah, there's many a beam from the fountain of day"
11897,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That, to reach us unclouded, must pass, on its way,"
11898,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Through the soul of a woman, and hers is wide ope"
11899,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To the influence of Heaven as the blue eyes of Hope;
11900,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Yes, a great heart is hers, one that dares to go in"
11901,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the prison, the slave-hut, the alleys of sin,      1430"
11902,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And to bring into each, or to find there, some line"
11903,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the never completely out-trampled divine;
11904,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If her heart at high floods swamps her brain now and then,"
11905,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Tis but richer for that when the tide ebbs agen,"
11906,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As, after old Nile has subsided, his plain"
11907,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Overflows with a second broad deluge of grain;
11908,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,What a wealth would it tiring to the narrow and sour
11909,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Could they be as a Child but for one little hour!
11910,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
11911,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'What! Irving? thrice welcome, warm heart and fine brain,"
11912,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You bring back the happiest spirit from Spain,      1440"
11913,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the gravest sweet humor, that ever were there"
11914,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Since Cervantes met death in his gentle despair;
11915,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Nay, don't be embarrassed, nor look so beseeching,"
11916,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I sha'n't run directly against my own preaching,"
11917,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, having just laughed at their Raphaels and Dantes,"
11918,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Go to setting you up beside matchless Cervantes;
11919,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But allow me to speak what I honestly feel,--"
11920,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To a true poet-heart add the fun of Dick Steele,"
11921,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Throw in all of Addison, _minus_ the chill,      1449"
11922,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the whole of that partnership's stock and good-will,"
11923,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Mix well, and while stirring, hum o'er, as a spell,"
11924,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The fine _old_ English Gentleman, simmer it well,"
11925,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sweeten just to your own private liking, then strain,"
11926,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That only the finest and clearest remain,"
11927,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Let it stand out of doors till a soul it receives
11928,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the warm lazy sun loitering down through green leaves,"
11929,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And you'll find a choice nature, not wholly deserving"

11933,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You'll be glad enough, some day or other, to claim,      1460"

13447,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,There dwelt two saints whose privilege sublime
13448,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"It was to sit and watch the world grow worse,"
13449,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Their only care (in that delicious clime)
13450,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,At proper intervals to pray and curse;

13453,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13454,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,One half the time of each was spent in praying

13456,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,The other half in fearfully portraying

13550,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,The painter of his boat he lightly threw

13552,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,

13556,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Just as our skins are tanned and freckled here;     100
13557,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,His air was that of a cosmopolite
13558,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,In the wide universe from sphere to sphere;
13559,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Perhaps he was (his face had such grave beauty)
13560,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,An officer of Saturn's guards off duty.
13561,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13562,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Both saints began to unfold their tales at once,"

13569,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Began to think his ear-drums in some danger.
13570,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13571,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,In general those who nothing have to say
13572,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Contrive to spend the longest time in doing it;
13573,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"They turn and vary it in every way,"
13574,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Hashing it, stewing it, mincing it, _ragouting_ it;"
13575,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Sometimes they keep it purposely at bay,"
13576,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Then let it slip to be again pursuing it;
13577,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"They drone it, groan it, whisper it and shout it,"
13578,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Refute it, flout it, swear to 't, prove it, doubt it.     120"
13579,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13580,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Our saints had practised for some thirty years;

13584,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Germs of yet new dispersion; once by the ears,"
13585,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"They could convey damnation in a hem,"
13586,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,And blow the pinch of premise-priming off
13587,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Long syllogistic batteries, with a cough."
13588,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13589,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Each had a theory that the human ear
13590,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"A providential tunnel was, which led      130"
13591,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,To a huge vacuum (and surely here
13592,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"They showed some knowledge of the general head,)"
13593,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"For cant to be decanted through, a mere"
13594,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Auricular canal or mill-race fed

13601,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Pished, pshawed, poohed, horribled, bahed, jeered, sneered, flouted,"
13602,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Sniffed, nonsensed, infideled, fudged, with his face"
13603,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Looked scorn too nicely shaded to be shouted,"
13604,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"And, with each inch of person and of vesture,"
13605,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Contrived to hint some most disdainful gesture.
13606,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,
13607,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"At length, when their breath's end was come about,"
13608,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,And both could now and then just gasp 'impostor!'
13609,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"Holding their heads thrust menacingly out,"
13610,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"As staggering cocks keep up their fighting posture,"
13611,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"The stranger smiled and said, 'Beyond a doubt"
13612,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"'Tis fortunate, my friends, that you have lost your     150"

13685,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Each hating t'other (moves it tears or laughter?)
13686,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Because he thought him sure of hell hereafter.

13688,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,At last some genius built a bridge of boats

13697,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,"All gone except their saint's religious hops,"
13698,AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE,Which he kept up with more than common flourish;

13744,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"[I have observed, reader (bene-or male-volent, as it may happen), that"
13745,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"it is customary to append to the second editions of books, and to the"
13746,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"second works of authors, short sentences commendatory of the first,"
13747,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"under the title of _Notices of the Press_. These, I have been given to"
13748,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"understand, are procurable at certain established rates, payment being"
13749,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher, or by an"
13750,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author. Considering
13751,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"these things with myself, and also that such notices are neither"
13752,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"intended, nor generally believed, to convey any real opinions, being a"
13753,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature, and resembling"
13754,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas, I conceived"
13755,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number
13756,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"of such myself, but also more immediately subservient to the end in view"
13757,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than to await the
13758,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"contingency of a second, when they would seem to be of small utility. To"
13759,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,delay attaching the _bobs_ until the second attempt at flying the kite
13760,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art. Neither has
13761,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"it escaped my notice nor failed to afford me matter of reflection, that,"
13762,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"when a circus or a caravan is about to visit Jaalam, the initial step is"
13763,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance, to be"
13764,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,hung in the bar-room and the post-office. These having been sufficiently
13765,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"gazed at, and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the"
13766,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"flies, and, truly, the boys also (in whom I find it impossible to"
13767,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"repress, even during school-hours, certain oral and telegraphic"
13768,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"communications concerning the expected show), upon some fine morning the"
13769,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"band enters in a gayly painted wagon, or triumphal chariot, and with"
13770,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"noisy advertisement, by means of brass, wood, and sheepskin, makes the"
13771,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"circuit of our startled village streets. Then, as the exciting sounds"
13772,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"draw nearer and nearer, do I desiderate those eyes of Aristarchus,"
13773,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"'whose looks were as a breeching to a boy.' Then do I perceive, with"
13774,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"vain regret of wasted opportunities, the advantage of a pancratic or"
13775,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"pantechnic education, since he is most reverenced by my little subjects"
13776,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the
13777,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,revolving cask. The story of the Pied Piper becomes for the first time
13778,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,credible to me (albeit confirmed by the Hameliners dating their legal
13779,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"instruments from the period of his exit), as I behold how those strains,"
13780,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"without pretence of magical potency, bewitch the pupillary legs, nor"
13781,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"leave to the pedagogic an entire self-control. For these reasons, lest"
13782,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution, I prorogue my restless"
13783,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"commons, whom I follow into the street, chiefly lest some mischief may"
13784,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"chance befall them. After the manner of such a band, I send forward the"
13785,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"following notices of domestic manufacture, to make brazen proclamation,"
13786,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue, if our little craft,"
13787,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"_cymbula sutilis_, shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze, and"
13788,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"to carry, in nautical phrase, a bone in her mouth. Nevertheless, I have"
13789,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"chosen, as being more equitable, to prepare some also sufficiently"
13790,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"objurgatory, that readers of every taste may find a dish to their"
13791,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"palate. I have modelled them upon actually existing specimens, preserved"
13792,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"in my own cabinet of natural curiosities. One, in particular, I had"

13794,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"discourses, which, from its superior tone and appearance of vast"
13795,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"experience, I concluded to have been written by a man at least three"
13796,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"hundred years of age, though I recollected no existing instance of such"
13797,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"antediluvian longevity. Nevertheless, I afterwards discovered the author"
13798,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction
13799,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS,"of one of my brethren in a neighboring town, and whom I had once"

14276,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"title-page, omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name"
14277,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"which not only add greatly to the value of every book, but whet and"
14278,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,exacerbate the appetite of the reader. For not only does he surmise that
14279,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a
14280,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of
14281,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"such decorations, but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an"
14282,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the
14283,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,reputation of such bodies as the _S. Archæol. Dahom._ or the _Acad.
14284,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,Lit. et Scient. Kamtschat_. I cannot but think that the early editions
14285,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,of Shakespeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general
14286,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"acceptance, but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages; and"
14287,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"I believe that, even now, a publisher of the works of either of those"
14288,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their
14289,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent,--a"
14290,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment
14291,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"against Socrates, when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond"
14292,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"the reach of antidotes, and when his memory had acquired a deserved"
14293,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,respectability. I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of
14294,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style himself 'Gent.' on the
14295,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"title-page of his Essay, as who should say to his readers that they"
14296,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman.
14297,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,
14298,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"Nevertheless, finding that, without descending to a smaller size of type"
14299,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several
14300,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"societies to be named, I could not compress my intended list within the"
14301,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"limits of a single page, and thinking, moreover, that the act would"
14302,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"carry with it an air of decorous modesty, I have chosen to take the"
14303,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"reader aside, as it were, into my private closet, and there not only"
14304,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"exhibit to him the diplomas which I already possess, but also to furnish"
14305,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"him with a prophetic vision of those which I may, without undue"
14306,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"presumption, hope for, as not beyond the reach of human ambition and"
14307,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,attainment. And I am the rather induced to this from the fact that my
14308,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of
14309,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,our beloved _Alma Mater_. Whether this is to be attributed to the
14310,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,difficulty of Latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts (with a complete
14311,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,list of which I took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year
14312,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"beforehand), or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives,"
14313,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"I forbear to consider in this place, the matter being in course of"
14314,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"painful investigation. But, however this may be, I felt the omission the"
14315,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"more keenly, as I had, in expectation of the new catalogue, enriched the"
14316,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"library of the Jaalam Athenæum with the old one then in my possession,"
14317,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a
14318,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,never-wearying winter evening's amusement in looking out the name of
14319,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,their parent in that distinguished roll. Those harmless innocents had at
14320,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"least committed no--but I forbear, having intrusted my reflections and"
14321,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,animadversions on this painful topic to the safe-keeping of my private
14322,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"diary, intended for posthumous publication. I state this fact here, in"
14323,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"order that certain nameless individuals, who are, perhaps, overmuch"
14324,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"congratulating themselves upon my silence, may know that a rod is in"
14325,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply
14326,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,to their memories.
14327,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,
14328,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"The careful reader will note that, in the list which I have prepared, I"
14329,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies to which a
14330,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature. I have
14331,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"ventured to do this, not only to encourage native ambition and genius,"
14332,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,but also because I have never been able to perceive in what way distance
14333,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,(unless we suppose them at the end of a lever) could increase the weight
14334,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,of learned bodies. As far as I have been able to extend my researches
14335,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach America, I have"
14336,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,discovered no generic difference between the antipodal _Fogrum
14337,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"Japonicum_ and the _F. Americanum_, sufficiently common in our own"
14338,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"immediate neighborhood. Yet, with a becoming deference to the popular"
14339,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every
14340,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,"additional mile they travel, I have intermixed the names of some"
14341,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE,tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest.

14381,INTRODUCTION,"When, more than three years ago, my talented young parishioner, Mr."
14382,INTRODUCTION,"Biglow, came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his"
14383,INTRODUCTION,poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city
14384,INTRODUCTION,"newspaper, it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that"
14385,INTRODUCTION,"his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume, and ushered"
14386,INTRODUCTION,into the august presence of the reading public by myself.
14387,INTRODUCTION,
14388,INTRODUCTION,So little are we short-sighted mortals able to predict the event! I
14389,INTRODUCTION,confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated
14390,INTRODUCTION,(though only as sleeping partner) in a book which can stand by itself in
14391,INTRODUCTION,an independent unity on the shelves of libraries. For there is always
14392,INTRODUCTION,"this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon, that, whereas the"
14393,INTRODUCTION,queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough
14394,INTRODUCTION,"to make a separate volume, those religious and godly-minded children"
14395,INTRODUCTION,"(those Samuels, if I may call them so) of the brain must at first be"
14396,INTRODUCTION,"buried in an undistinguished heap, and then get such resurrection as is"
14397,INTRODUCTION,"vouchsafed to them, mummy-wrapped with a score of others in a cheap"
14398,INTRODUCTION,"binding, with no other mark of distinction than the word"
14399,INTRODUCTION,'_Miscellaneous_' printed upon the back. Far be it from me to claim any
14400,INTRODUCTION,credit for the quite unexpected popularity which I am pleased to find
14401,INTRODUCTION,"these bucolic strains have attained unto. If I know myself, I am"
14402,INTRODUCTION,measurably free from the itch of vanity; yet I may be allowed to say
14403,INTRODUCTION,"that I was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild, puckery,"
14404,INTRODUCTION,"acidulous (sometimes even verging toward that point which, in our rustic"
14405,INTRODUCTION,"phrase, is termed _shut-eyed_) flavor, not wholly unpleasing, nor"
14406,INTRODUCTION,"unwholesome, to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and"
14407,INTRODUCTION,"cultivated fruit. It may be, also, that some touches of my own, here and"
14408,INTRODUCTION,"there, may have led to their wider acceptance, albeit solely from my"
14409,INTRODUCTION,larger experience of literature and authorship.[9]
14410,INTRODUCTION,
14411,INTRODUCTION,"I was at first inclined to discourage Mr. Biglow's attempts, as knowing"
14412,INTRODUCTION,that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to
14413,INTRODUCTION,"adolescence, which, if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a"
14414,INTRODUCTION,"bold hand applied, may become chronic, and render one, who might else"
14415,INTRODUCTION,"have become in due time an ornament of the social circle, a painful"
14416,INTRODUCTION,"object even to nearest friends and relatives. But thinking, on a further"
14417,INTRODUCTION,experience that there was a germ of promise in him which required only
14418,INTRODUCTION,"culture and the pulling up of weeds from about it, I thought it best to"
14419,INTRODUCTION,set before him the acknowledged examples of English composition in
14420,INTRODUCTION,"verse, and leave the rest to natural emulation. With this view, I"
14421,INTRODUCTION,"accordingly lent him some volumes of Pope and Goldsmith, to the"
14422,INTRODUCTION,assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings. Not long
14423,INTRODUCTION,"afterward, he brought me some verses written upon that model, a specimen"
14424,INTRODUCTION,"of which I subjoin, having changed some phrases of less elegancy, and a"
14425,INTRODUCTION,few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear. The poem consisted of
14426,INTRODUCTION,"childish reminiscences, and the sketches which follow will not seem"
14427,INTRODUCTION,destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country
14428,INTRODUCTION,"village. And, first, let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the"
14429,INTRODUCTION,school-dame.

14522,INTRODUCTION,"making of it, and, finding the manufacture profitable, continued the"
14523,INTRODUCTION,supply in an adequate proportion to the demand.

14528,INTRODUCTION,"As, every time he told it, Joe drew near"
14529,INTRODUCTION,"To the main fight, till, faded and grown gray,"
14530,INTRODUCTION,The original scene to bolder tints gave way;
14531,INTRODUCTION,Then Joe had heard the foe's scared double-quick
14532,INTRODUCTION,"Beat on stove drum with one un-captured stick,"
14533,INTRODUCTION,"And, ere death came the lengthening tale to lop,"
14534,INTRODUCTION,"Himself had fired, and seen a redcoat drop;"

14536,INTRODUCTION,"Had squared more nearly with his sense of right,"
14537,INTRODUCTION,"And vanquished Percy, to complete the tale,"

14539,INTRODUCTION,
14540,INTRODUCTION,I do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own
14541,INTRODUCTION,"rather than Mr. Biglow's, as, indeed, he maintained stoutly that my file"
14542,INTRODUCTION,"had left nothing of his in them. I should not, perhaps, have felt"
14543,INTRODUCTION,"entitled to take so great liberties with them, had I not more than"
14544,INTRODUCTION,"suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself, a very near ancestor"
14545,INTRODUCTION,having written a Latin poem in the Harvard _Gratulatio_ on the accession
14546,INTRODUCTION,"of George the Third. Suffice it to say, that, whether not satisfied with"
14547,INTRODUCTION,"such limited approbation as I could conscientiously bestow, or from a"
14548,INTRODUCTION,"sense of natural inaptitude, certain it is that my young friend could"
14549,INTRODUCTION,never be induced to any further essays in this kind. He affirmed that it
14550,INTRODUCTION,"was to him like writing in a foreign tongue,--that Mr. Pope's"
14551,INTRODUCTION,"versification was like the regular ticking of one of Willard's clocks,"
14552,INTRODUCTION,"in which one could fancy, after long listening, a certain kind of rhythm"
14553,INTRODUCTION,"or tune, but which yet was only a poverty-stricken _tick, tick_, after"
14554,INTRODUCTION,"all,--and that he had never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so"
14555,INTRODUCTION,"fairly, or in forms so pleasing to his eye, as a fox-grape over a"
14556,INTRODUCTION,"scrub-oak in a swamp. He added I know not what, to the effect that the"
14557,INTRODUCTION,sweet-water would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves
14558,INTRODUCTION,"starched and ironed out, and that Pegasus (so he called him) hardly"
14559,INTRODUCTION,looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers. These and other such
14560,INTRODUCTION,"opinions I did not long strive to eradicate, attributing them rather to"
14561,INTRODUCTION,a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with
14562,INTRODUCTION,"purely natural objects, than to a perverted moral sense. I was the more"
14563,INTRODUCTION,"inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek,"
14564,INTRODUCTION,"that his verses, wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and"
14565,INTRODUCTION,"point, had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner."
14566,INTRODUCTION,"So, only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name"
14567,INTRODUCTION,"Pegasus, I left him to follow the bent of his natural genius."
14568,INTRODUCTION,
14569,INTRODUCTION,Yet could I not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan
14570,INTRODUCTION,"(which, literally interpreted, signifies village) muse without yet a"
14571,INTRODUCTION,"further effort for his conversion, and to this end I resolved that"
14572,INTRODUCTION,"whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself, aided by the assiduous"
14573,INTRODUCTION,"bellows of correct models, should be put in requisition. Accordingly,"
14574,INTRODUCTION,when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses
14575,INTRODUCTION,which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting
14576,INTRODUCTION,"from the Mexican war, and the folly of leaving the question of slavery"
14577,INTRODUCTION,"or freedom to the adjudication of chance, I did myself indite a short"
14578,INTRODUCTION,"fable or apologue after the manner of Gay and Prior, to the end that he"
14579,INTRODUCTION,might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of
14580,INTRODUCTION,a more refined style and more elegant expression. Mr. Biglow's

14832,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","which has wanted neither open maligners, nor even more dangerous enemies"
14833,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that

14884,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","after all, thin, speculative Jonathan is more like the Englishman of two"
14885,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",centuries ago than John Bull himself is. He has lost somewhat in
14886,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","solidity, has become fluent and adaptable, but more of the original"
14887,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",groundwork of character remains. He feels more at home with Fulke
14888,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","Greville, Herbert of Cherbury, Quarles, George Herbert, and Browne, than"
14889,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","with his modern English cousins. He is nearer than John, by at least a"
14890,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","hundred years, to Naseby, Marston Moor, Worcester, and the time when, if"
14891,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.","ever, there were true Englishmen. John Bull has suffered the idea of the"
14892,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",Invisible to be very much fattened out of him. Jonathan is conscious
14893,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",still that he lives in the world of the Unseen as well as of the Seen.
14894,"BY HOMER WILBUR, A.M.",To move John you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding; an

14920,"COLUMBUS NYE,","It remains to speak of the Yankee dialect. And, first, it may be"
14921,"COLUMBUS NYE,","premised, in a general way, that any one much read in the writings of"
14922,"COLUMBUS NYE,",the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the
14923,"COLUMBUS NYE,","words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to New England, and local there,"
14924,"COLUMBUS NYE,",were brought from the mother country. A person familiar with the
14925,"COLUMBUS NYE,","dialect of certain portions of Massachusetts will not fail to recognize,"
14926,"COLUMBUS NYE,","in ordinary discourse, many words now noted in English vocabularies as"
14927,"COLUMBUS NYE,","archaic, the greater part of which were in common use about the time of"
14928,"COLUMBUS NYE,",the King James translation of the Bible. Shakespeare stands less in need
14929,"COLUMBUS NYE,",of a glossary to most New-Englanders than to many a native of the Old
14930,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Country. The peculiarities of our speech, however, are rapidly wearing"
14931,"COLUMBUS NYE,",out. As there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers
14932,"COLUMBUS NYE,","are so multitudinous, so no phrase remains long local, but is"
14933,"COLUMBUS NYE,",transplanted in the mail-bags to every remotest corner of the land.
14934,"COLUMBUS NYE,",Consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of
14935,"COLUMBUS NYE,",any other nation.
14936,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14937,"COLUMBUS NYE,",The English have complained of us for coining new words. Many of those
14938,"COLUMBUS NYE,","so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten, and all make now an"
14939,"COLUMBUS NYE,","unquestioned part of the currency, wherever English is spoken."
14940,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Undoubtedly, we have a right to make new words, as they are needed by"
14941,"COLUMBUS NYE,",the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the New
14942,"COLUMBUS NYE,","World; and, indeed, wherever a language is alive, it grows. It might be"
14943,"COLUMBUS NYE,",questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the
14944,"COLUMBUS NYE,",ownership of the English tongue than the mother-islanders themselves.
14945,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Here, past all question, is to be its great home and centre. And not"
14946,"COLUMBUS NYE,","only is it already spoken here by greater numbers, but with a far higher"
14947,"COLUMBUS NYE,","popular average of correctness than in Britain. The great writers of it,"
14948,"COLUMBUS NYE,","too, we might claim as ours, were ownership to be settled by the number"
14949,"COLUMBUS NYE,",of readers and lovers.
14950,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14951,"COLUMBUS NYE,","As regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume, I may say"
14952,"COLUMBUS NYE,",that the reader will not find one which is not (as I believe) either
14953,"COLUMBUS NYE,","native or imported with the early settlers, nor one which I have not,"
14954,"COLUMBUS NYE,","with my own ears, heard in familiar use. In the metrical portion of the"
14955,"COLUMBUS NYE,","book, I have endeavored to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to"
14956,"COLUMBUS NYE,",the ordinary mode of pronunciation. Let the reader who deems me
14957,"COLUMBUS NYE,",over-particular remember this caution of Martial:--
14958,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14959,"COLUMBUS NYE,","'Quem recitas, meus est, O Fidentine, libellus;"
14960,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Sed male cum recitas, incipit esse tuus.'"
14961,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14962,"COLUMBUS NYE,",A few further explanatory remarks will not be impertinent.
14963,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14964,"COLUMBUS NYE,",I shall barely lay down a few general rules for the reader's guidance.
14965,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14966,"COLUMBUS NYE,",1. The genuine Yankee never gives the rough sound to the _r_ when he can
14967,"COLUMBUS NYE,","help it, and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even"
14968,"COLUMBUS NYE,",before a vowel.
14969,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14970,"COLUMBUS NYE,","2. He seldom sounds the final _g_, a piece of self-denial, if we"
14971,"COLUMBUS NYE,","consider his partiality for nasals. The same of the final _d_, as _han'_"
14972,"COLUMBUS NYE,",and _stan'_ for _hand_ and _stand_.
14973,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14974,"COLUMBUS NYE,","3. The _h_ in such words as _while, when, where,_ he omits altogether."
14975,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14976,"COLUMBUS NYE,","4. In regard to _a_, he shows some inconsistency, sometimes giving a"
14977,"COLUMBUS NYE,","close and obscure sound, as _hev_ for _have, hendy_ for _handy, ez_ for"
14978,"COLUMBUS NYE,","_as, thet_ for _that_, and again giving it the broad sound it has in"
14979,"COLUMBUS NYE,","_father_, as _hânsome_ for _handsome._"
14980,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14981,"COLUMBUS NYE,",5. To the sound _ou_ he prefixes an _e_ (hard to exemplify otherwise
14982,"COLUMBUS NYE,",than orally).
14983,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14984,"COLUMBUS NYE,",The following passage in Shakespeare he would recite thus:--
14985,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
14986,"COLUMBUS NYE,",'Neow is the winta uv eour discontent
14987,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Med glorious summa by this sun o'Yock,"
14988,"COLUMBUS NYE,",An' all the cleouds thet leowered upun eour heouse
14989,"COLUMBUS NYE,",In the deep buzzum o' the oshin buried;
14990,"COLUMBUS NYE,",Neow air eour breows beound 'ith victorious wreaths;
14991,"COLUMBUS NYE,",Eour breused arms hung up fer monimunce;
14992,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Eour starn alarums changed to merry meetins,"
14993,"COLUMBUS NYE,",Eour dreffle marches to delighfle masures.
14994,"COLUMBUS NYE,","Grim-visaged war heth smeuthed his wrinkled front,"
14995,"COLUMBUS NYE,","An' neow, instid o' mountin' bare-bid steeds"
14996,"COLUMBUS NYE,","To fright the souls o' ferfle edverseries,"
14997,"COLUMBUS NYE,","He capers nimly in a lady's chămber,"
14998,"COLUMBUS NYE,",To the lascivious pleasin' uv a loot.'
14999,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15000,"COLUMBUS NYE,","6. _Au_, in such words as _daughter_ and _slaughter_, he pronounces"
15001,"COLUMBUS NYE,",_ah_.
15002,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15003,"COLUMBUS NYE,",7. To the dish thus seasoned add a drawl _ad libitum_.
15004,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15005,"COLUMBUS NYE,",[Mr. Wilbur's notes here become entirely fragmentary.--C.N.]
15006,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15007,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15008,"COLUMBUS NYE,","[Greek: a]. Unable to procure a likeness of Mr. Biglow, I thought the"
15009,"COLUMBUS NYE,",curious reader might be gratified with a sight of the editorial
15010,"COLUMBUS NYE,","effigies. And here a choice between two was offered,--the one a profile"
15011,"COLUMBUS NYE,","(entirely black) cut by Doyle, the other a portrait painted by a native"
15012,"COLUMBUS NYE,","artist of much promise. The first of these seemed wanting in expression,"
15013,"COLUMBUS NYE,",and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been
15014,"COLUMBUS NYE,",heightened (perhaps from an over-desire of force on the part of the
15015,"COLUMBUS NYE,",artist) into too close an approach to actual _strabismus_. This slight
15016,"COLUMBUS NYE,",divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary model--however I
15017,"COLUMBUS NYE,",may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a
15018,"COLUMBUS NYE,","cross, since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal"
15019,"COLUMBUS NYE,","application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation,"
15020,"COLUMBUS NYE,",without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my
15021,"COLUMBUS NYE,",eye (as the saying is)--seemed yet to Mrs. Wilbur a sufficient objection
15022,"COLUMBUS NYE,",to the engraving of the aforesaid painting. We read of many who either
15023,"COLUMBUS NYE,","absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features, as especially"
15024,"COLUMBUS NYE,","did Plotinus and Agesilaus among the ancients, not to mention the more"
15025,"COLUMBUS NYE,","modern instances of Scioppius, Palæottus, Pinellus, Velserus, Gataker,"
15026,"COLUMBUS NYE,","and others, or were indifferent thereto, as Cromwell."
15027,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15028,"COLUMBUS NYE,",[Greek: b.] Yet was Cæsar desirous of concealing his baldness. _Per
15029,"COLUMBUS NYE,","contra_, my Lord Protector's carefulness in the matter of his wart might"
15030,"COLUMBUS NYE,",be cited. Men generally more desirous of being _improved_ in their
15031,"COLUMBUS NYE,",portraits than characters. Shall probably find very unflattered
15032,"COLUMBUS NYE,",likenesses of ourselves in Recording Angel's gallery.
15033,"COLUMBUS NYE,",
15034,"COLUMBUS NYE,",[Greek: g.] Whether any of our national peculiarities may be traced to
15035,"COLUMBUS NYE,","our use of stoves, as a certain closeness of the lips in pronunciation,"
15036,"COLUMBUS NYE,",and a smothered smoulderingness of disposition seldom roused to open
15037,"COLUMBUS NYE,",flame? An unrestrained intercourse with fire probably conducive to
15038,"COLUMBUS NYE,","generosity and hospitality of soul. Ancient Mexicans used stoves, as the"
15039,"COLUMBUS NYE,","friar Augustin Ruiz reports, Hakluyt, III. 468,--but Popish priests not"
15040,"COLUMBUS NYE,",always reliable authority.

15047,"COLUMBUS NYE,",there was never a poet among his ancestors. An ordination hymn

15398,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious theory
15399,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"which supposes that children, if left entirely to themselves, would"
15400,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,naturally discourse in Hebrew. For this the authority of one experiment
15401,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"is claimed, and I could, with Sir Thomas Browne, desire its"
15402,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"establishment, inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred tongue would"
15403,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,thereby be facilitated. I am aware that Herodotus states the conclusion
15404,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"of Psammetieus to have been in favor of a dialect of the Phrygian. But,"
15405,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,beside the chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be
15406,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"blessed to a Pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity, we have on"
15407,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,the Hebrew side the comparatively recent investigation of James the
15408,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"Fourth of Scotland. I will add to this prefatory remark, that Mr. Sawin,"
15409,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"though a native of Jaalam, has never been a stated attendant on the"
15410,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,religious exercises of my congregation. I consider my humble efforts
15411,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the wolf's
15412,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"clothing of war, save for the comparatively innocent diversion of a"
15413,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,militia training. Not that my flock are backward to undergo the
15414,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,hardships of _defensive_ warfare. They serve cheerfully in the great
15415,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"army which fights, even unto death _pro aris et focis_, accoutred with"
15416,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"the spade, the axe, the plane, the sledge, the spelling-book, and other"
15417,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,such effectual weapons against want and ignorance and unthrift. I have
15418,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,taught them (under God) to esteem our human institutions as but tents of
15419,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT,"a night, to be stricken whenever Truth puts the bugle to her lips and"

15585,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"with a vision of St. James of Compostella, skewering the infidels upon"

15601,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"Satan cunning in. Before one he trails a hat and feather, or a bare"

15611,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,_Dioscuri_ (whom we must conclude imps of the pit) who sundry times
15612,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"captained the pagan Roman soldiery, it is strange that our first"
15613,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,American crusade was not in some such wise also signalized. Yet it is
15614,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,said that the Lord hath manifestly prospered our armies. This opens the
15615,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"question, whether, when our hands are strengthened to make great"
15616,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"slaughter of our enemies, it be absolutely and demonstratively certain"
15617,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"that this might is added to us from above, or whether some Potentate"
15618,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it, as there are few"
15619,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust. Would the Sanctifier
15620,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,and Setter-apart of the seventh day have assisted in a victory gained on
15621,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"the Sabbath, as was one in the late war? Do we not know from Josephus,"
15622,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"that, careful of His decree, a certain river in Judaea abstained from"
15623,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,flowing on the day of Rest? Or has that day become less an object of His
15624,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"especial care since the year 1697, when so manifest a providence"
15625,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"occurred to Mr. William Trowbridge, in answer to whose prayers, when he"
15626,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"and all on shipboard with him were starving, a dolphin was sent daily,"
15627,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,'which was enough to serve 'em; only on _Saturdays_ they still catched a
15628,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"couple, and on the _Lord's Days_ they could catch none at all'? Haply"
15629,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"they might have been permitted, by way of mortification, to take some"
15630,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"few sculpins (those banes of the salt-water angler), which unseemly fish"
15631,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"would, moreover, have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their"

15633,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,_Cape Cod Clergymen_.
15634,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,
15635,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,It has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know that our
15636,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,Chief Magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval the (by many

15638,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"that mind, that I could not but set my face against this Mexican Polka,"
15639,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,though danced to the Presidential piping with a Gubernatorial second. If
15640,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,ever the country should be seized with another such mania _pro
15641,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"propaganda fide_, I think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with"
15642,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"alternate copies of the Cambridge Platform and the Thirty-nine Articles,"
15643,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"which would produce a mixture of the highest explosive power, and to"
15644,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"wrap every one of our cannon-balls in a leaf of the New Testament, the"
15645,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,reading of which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of Popery.
15646,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,Those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate vital religion
15647,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,and Gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary. I
15648,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"have seen lads, unimpregnate with the more sublimated punctiliousness of"
15649,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"Walton, secure pickerel, taking their unwary _siesta_ beneath the"
15650,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"lily-pads too nigh the surface, with a gun and small shot. Why not,"
15651,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"then, since gunpowder was unknown in the time of the Apostles (not to"

15656,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,I do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a Protestant

15667,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"expectation thereof, is wholly incompetent to this refractory"
15668,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"monosyllable. An abject and herpetic Public Opinion is the Pope, the"
15669,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"Anti-Christ, for us to protest against _e corde cordium_. And by what"
15670,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"College of Cardinals is this our God's-vicar, our binder and looser,"
15671,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"elected? Very like, by the sacred conclave of Tag, Rag, and Bobtail, in"
15672,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,the gracious atmosphere of the grog-shop. Yet it is of this that we must
15673,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"all be puppets. This thumps the pulpit-cushion, this guides the editor's"
15674,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"pen, this wags the senator's tongue. This decides what Scriptures are"
15675,BIRDOFREDOM SAWIN.,"canonical, and shuffles Christ away into the Apocrypha. According to"

15692,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,[A few remarks on the following verses will not be out of place. The
15693,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"satire in them was not meant to have any personal, but only a general,"
15694,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,application. Of the gentleman upon whose letter they were intended as a
15695,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"commentary Mr. Biglow had never heard, till he saw the letter itself."
15696,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,The position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have
15697,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"chosen, had the election been left to himself. In attacking bad"
15698,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"principles, he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself"
15699,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"their exponent, and in whom they are impersonate, to the end that what"
15700,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"he says may not, through ambiguity, be dissipated _tenues in auras._ For"
15701,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"what says Seneca? _Longum iter per præcepta, breve et efficace per"
15702,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,exempla_. A bad principle is comparatively harmless while it continues
15703,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"to be an abstraction, nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till"
15704,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"it is printed in that large type which all men can read at sight,"
15705,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"namely, the life and character, the sayings and doings, of particular"
15706,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"persons. It is one of the cunningest fetches of Satan, that he never"
15707,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"exposes himself directly to our arrows, but, still dodging behind this"
15708,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"neighbor or that acquaintance, compels us to wound him through them, if"
15709,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"at all. He holds our affections as hostages, the while he patches up a"
15710,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,truce with our conscience.

15712,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"Meanwhile, let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist is not to"

15714,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"Falsehood start from the same point, and sometimes even go along"
15715,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"together for a little way, his business is to follow the path of the"
15716,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"latter after it diverges, and to show her floundering in the bog at the"
15717,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,end of it. Truth is quite beyond the reach of satire. There is so brave
15718,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"a simplicity in her, that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak"
15719,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"or a pine. The danger of the satirist is, that continual use may deaden"
15720,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,his sensibility to the force of language. He becomes more and more
15721,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,liable to strike harder than he knows or intends. He may be careful to
15722,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"put on his boxing-gloves, and yet forget that, the older they grow, the"
15723,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt. Moreover, in the heat of"
15724,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"contest, the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory, whose"
15725,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures
15726,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,Truth's wreath of simple leaves. I have sometimes thought that my young
15727,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"friend, Mr. Biglow, needed a monitory hand laid on his arm,--_aliquid"
15728,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,sufflaminandus erat_. I have never thought it good husbandry to water
15729,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"the tender plants of reform with _aqua fortis_, yet, where so much is to"

15816,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"much more, certain personages, elevated for the time being to high"
15817,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"station, our country. I would not sever nor loosen a single one of those"
15818,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"ties by which we are united to the spot of our birth, nor minish by a"
15819,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,tittle the respect due to the Magistrate. I love our own Bay State too
15820,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"well to do the one, and as for the other, I have myself for nigh forty"
15821,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"years exercised, however unworthily, the function of Justice of the"
15822,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"Peace, having been called thereto by the unsolicited kindness of that"
15823,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"most excellent man and upright patriot, Caleb Strong. _Patriæ fumus"
15824,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"igne alieno luculentior_ is best qualified with this,--_Ubi libertas, ibi"
15825,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"patria_. We are inhabitants of two worlds, and owe a double, but not a"
15826,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"divided, allegiance. In virtue of our clay, this little ball of earth"
15827,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"exacts a certain loyalty of us, while, in our capacity as spirits, we"
15828,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,are admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland. There is a
15829,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and
15830,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,terrene fealty. Our true country is that ideal realm which we represent
15831,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"to ourselves under the names of religion, duty, and the like. Our"
15832,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"terrestrial organizations are but far-off approaches to so fair a model,"
15833,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert
15834,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"them from this their original intendment. When, therefore, one would"
15835,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"have us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitude,--'_Our"
15836,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"country, however bounded!_' he demands of us that we sacrifice the"
15837,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"larger to the less, the higher to the lower, and that we yield to the"
15838,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty and privilege as
15839,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,liegemen of Truth. Our true country is bounded on the north and the
15840,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"south, on the east and the west, by Justice, and when she oversteps that"
15841,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair's-breadth, she ceases to be"
15842,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,"our mother, and chooses rather to be looked upon _quasi noverca_. That"
15843,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,is a hard choice when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread
15844,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,one path and our duty points us to another. We must make as noble and
15845,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,becoming an election as did Penelope between Icarius and Ulysses.

15899,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS,'The productions of Mr. B. have been stigmatized in some quarters as

16431,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,verses was the unsuccessful attempt of Drayton and Sayres to give
16432,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"freedom to seventy men and women, fellow-beings and fellow-Christians."

16437,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"at the seat of government. Very fitly is he named Key, who would allow"

16443,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"Mr. Calhoun, who is made the chief speaker in this burlesque, seems to"
16444,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,think that the light of the nineteenth century is to be put out as soon

16456,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"But we are all alike. We have all heard it said, often enough, that"

16458,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"away from us, and put out of reach upon the shelf, we must needs get"
16459,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"into our little corner, and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire"

16474,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"which bound the universe together; and when he smote the Earth, though"
16475,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"with his terrible mallet, it was but as if a leaf had fallen. Yet all"
16476,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,the while it seemed to Thor that he had only been wrestling with an old
16477,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"woman, striving to lift a cat, and striking a stupid giant on the head."
16478,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,
16479,SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME,"And in old times, doubtless, the giants _were_ stupid, and there was no"

16632,HOSEA BIGLOW.,the certain result. Perhaps our suspicious passenger is no Jonah after
16633,HOSEA BIGLOW.,"all, being black. For it is well known that a superintending Providence"

16686,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"[At the special instance of Mr. Biglow, I preface the following satire"
16687,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"with an extract from a sermon preached during the past summer, from"
16688,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Ezekiel xxxiv. 2: 'Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of"
16689,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Israel.' Since the Sabbath on which this discourse was delivered, the"
16690,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,editor of the 'Jaalam Independent Blunderbuss' has unaccountably
16691,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,absented himself from our house of worship.
16692,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16693,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,'I know of no so responsible position as that of the public journalist.
16694,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,The editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk
16695,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"bore to the age before the invention of printing. Indeed, the position"
16696,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now. But the
16697,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world, and to"
16698,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls
16699,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"the Next Life. As if _next_ did not mean _nearest_, and as if any life"
16700,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all
16701,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"around him at the caucus, the ratification meeting, and the polls! Who"
16702,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity, as for some future era"
16703,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,of which the present forms no integral part? The furrow which Time is
16704,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"even now turning runs through the Everlasting, and in that must he"
16705,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"plant, or nowhere. Yet he would fain believe and teach that we are"
16706,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,_going_ to have more of eternity than we have now. This _going_ of his
16707,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"is like that of the auctioneer, on which _gone_ follows before we have"
16708,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"made up our minds to bid,--in which manner, not three months back, I"
16709,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,lost an excellent copy of Chappelow on Job. So it has come to pass that
16710,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"the preacher, instead of being a living force, has faded into an"
16711,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"emblematic figure at christenings, weddings, and funerals. Or, if he"
16712,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"exercise any other function, it is as keeper and feeder of certain"
16713,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"theologic dogmas, which, when occasion offers, he unkennels with a"
16714,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"_staboy!_ ""to bark and bite as 'tis their nature to,"" whence that"
16715,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,reproach of _odium theologicum_ has arisen.

16718,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"congregation of fifty thousand within reach of his voice, and never so"
16719,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"much as a nodder, even, among them! And from what a Bible can he choose"
16720,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"his text,--a Bible which needs no translation, and which no priestcraft"
16721,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"can shut and clasp from the laity,--the open volume of the world, upon"
16722,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"which, with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire, the inspired Present"
16723,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,is even now writing the annals of God! Methinks the editor who should
16724,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"understand his calling, and be equal thereto, would truly deserve that"
16725,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"title of [Greek: poimaen laon], which Homer bestows upon princes. He"
16726,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"would be the Moses of our nineteenth century; and whereas the old Sinai,"

16869,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16870,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,[I subjoin here another passage from my before-mentioned discourse.
16871,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16872,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16873,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"'Wonderful, to him that has eyes to see it rightly, is the newspaper. To"
16874,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"me, for example, sitting on the critical front bench of the pit, in my"
16875,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"study here in Jaalam, the advent of my weekly journal is as that of a"
16876,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"strolling theatre, or rather of a puppet-show, on whose stage, narrow as"
16877,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"it is, the tragedy, comedy, and farce of life are played in little."
16878,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,Behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a brown-paper
16879,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,wrapper!
16880,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16881,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"'Hither, to my obscure corner, by wind or steam, on horseback or"
16882,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"dromedary-back, in the pouch of the Indian runner, or clicking over the"
16883,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"magnetic wires, troop all the famous performers from the four quarters"
16884,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"of the globe. Looked at from a point of criticism, tiny puppets they"
16885,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"seem all, as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and officiates as"
16886,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,showman. Now I can truly see how little and transitory is life. The
16887,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"earth appears almost as a drop of vinegar, on which the solar microscope"
16888,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,of the imagination must be brought to bear in order to make out
16889,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"anything distinctly. That animalcule there, in the pea-jacket, is Louis"
16890,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Philippe, just landed on the coast of England. That other, in the gray"
16891,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"surtout and cocked hat, is Napoleon Bonaparte Smith, assuring France"
16892,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,that she need apprehend no interference from him in the present alarming
16893,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"juncture. At that spot, where you seem to see a speck of something in"
16894,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"motion, is an immense mass-meeting. Look sharper, and you will see a"
16895,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited manner. That is the great
16896,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Mr. Soandso, defining his position amid tumultuous and irrepressible"
16897,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"cheers. That infinitesimal creature, upon whom some score of others, as"
16898,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"minute as he, are gazing in open-mouthed admiration, is a famous"
16899,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"philosopher, expounding to a select audience their capacity for the"
16900,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,Infinite. That scarce discernible pufflet of smoke and dust is a
16901,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"revolution. That speck there is a reformer, just arranging the lever"
16902,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"with which he is to move the world. And lo, there creeps forward the"
16903,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"shadow of a skeleton that blows one breath between its grinning teeth,"
16904,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,and all our distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into
16905,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,the dark Beyond.
16906,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16907,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"'Yes, the little show-box has its solemner suggestions. Now and then we"
16908,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"catch a glimpse of a grim old man, who lays down a scythe and hour-glass"
16909,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"in the corner while he shifts the scenes. There, too, in the dim"
16910,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"background, a weird shape is ever delving. Sometimes he leans upon his"
16911,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"mattock, and gazes, as a coach whirls by, bearing the newly married on"
16912,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"their wedding jaunt, or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from"
16913,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,christening. Suddenly (for the scene grows larger and larger as we look)
16914,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"a bony hand snatches back a performer in the midst of his part, and him,"
16915,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"whom yesterday two infinities (past and future) would not suffice, a"
16916,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"handful of dust is enough to cover and silence forever. Nay, we see the"
16917,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman himself, and guess,"
16918,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"not without a shudder, that they are lying in wait for spectator also."
16919,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16920,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,'Think of it: for three dollars a year I buy a season-ticket to this
16921,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"great Globe Theatre, for which God would write the dramas (only that we"
16922,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"like farces, spectacles, and the tragedies of Apollyon better), whose"
16923,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"scene-shifter is Time, and whose curtain is rung down by Death."
16924,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,
16925,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,'Such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as I am tearing off the
16926,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,wrapper of my newspaper. Then suddenly that otherwise too often vacant
16927,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,sheet becomes invested for me with a strange kind of awe. Look! deaths
16928,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"and marriages, notices of inventions, discoveries, and books, lists of"
16929,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"promotions, of killed, wounded, and missing, news of fires, accidents,"
16930,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,of sudden wealth and as sudden poverty;--I hold in my hand the ends of
16931,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"myriad invisible electric conductors, along which tremble the joys,"
16932,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"sorrows, wrongs, triumphs, hopes, and despairs of as many men and women"
16933,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,everywhere. So that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me
16934,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"from mankind as a spectator of their puppet-pranks, another supervenes,"
16935,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"in which I feel that I, too, unknown and unheard of, am yet of some"
16936,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"import to my fellows. For, through my newspaper here, do not families"
16937,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"take pains to send me, an entire stranger, news of a death among them?"
16938,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Are not here two who would have me know of their marriage? And,"
16939,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"strangest of all, is not this singular person anxious to have me"
16940,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,informed that he has received a fresh supply of Dimitry Bruisgins? But
16941,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,to none of us does the Present continue miraculous (even if for a moment
16942,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"discerned as such). We glance carelessly at the sunrise, and get used to"
16943,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"Orion and the Pleiades. The wonder wears off, and to-morrow this sheet,"
16944,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,"(Acts x. 11, 12) in which a vision was let down to me from Heaven, shall"
16945,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a beggar's broken
16946,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED,victuals.'--H.W.]

16958,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",
16959,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",[Curiosity may be said to be the quality which preeminently
16960,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals. As we trace the
16961,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","scale of animated nature downward, we find this faculty (as it may truly"
16962,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","he called) of the mind diminished in the savage, and wellnigh extinct"
16963,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",in the brute. The first object which civilized man proposes to himself I
16964,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",take to be the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbors.
16965,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",_Nihil humanum a me alienum puto;_ I am curious about even John Smith.
16966,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","The desire next in strength to this (an opposite pole, indeed, of the"
16967,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",same magnet) is that of communicating the unintelligence we have
16968,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",carefully picked up.
16969,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",
16970,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",Men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the
16971,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","communicative. To the first class belong Peeping Toms, eaves-droppers,"
16972,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","navel-contemplating Brahmins, metaphysicians, travellers, Empedocleses,"
16973,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","spies, the various societies for promoting Rhinothism, Columbuses,"
16974,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","Yankees, discoverers, and men of science, who present themselves to the"
16975,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the world,"
16976,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",or sitting in studies and laboratories. The second class I should again
16977,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",subdivide into four. In the first subdivision I would rank those who
16978,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","have an itch to tell us about themselves,--as keepers of diaries,"
16979,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","insignificant persons generally, Montaignes, Horace Walpoles,"
16980,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","autobiographers, poets. The second includes those who are anxious to"
16981,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","impart information concerning other people,--as historians, barbers, and"
16982,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",such. To the third belong those who labor to give us intelligence about
16983,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","nothing at all,--as novelists, political orators, the large majority of"
16984,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","authors, preachers, lecturers, and the like. In the fourth come those"
16985,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","who are communicative from motives of public benevolence,--as finders of"
16986,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",mares'-nests and bringers of ill news. Each of us two-legged fowls
16987,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater
16988,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","or less degree, for none of us so much as lays an egg, or incubates a"
16989,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","chalk one, but straightway the whole barnyard shall know it by our"
16990,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",cackle or our cluck. _Omnibus hoc vitium est_. There are different
16991,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",grades in all these classes. One will turn his telescope toward a
16992,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","back-yard, another toward Uranus; one will tell you that he dined with"
16993,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","Smith, another that he supped with Plato. In one particular, all men may"
16994,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","be considered as belonging to the first grand division, inasmuch as they"
16995,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in their neighbor's eye.
16996,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",
16997,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",To one or another of these species every human being may safely be
16998,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",referred. I think it beyond a peradventure that Jonah prosecuted some
16999,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","inquiries into the digestive apparatus of whales, and that Noah sealed"
17000,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","up a letter in an empty bottle, that news in regard to him might not be"
17001,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",wanting in case of the worst. They had else been super or subter human.
17002,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","I conceive, also, that, as there are certain persons who continually"
17003,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious door through which,"
17004,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","sooner or later, we all make our exits, so there are doubtless ghosts"
17005,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","fidgeting and fretting on the other side of it, because they have no"
17006,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",means of conveying back to this world the scraps of news they have
17007,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",picked up in that. For there is an answer ready somewhere to every
17008,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","question, the great law of _give and take_ runs through all nature, and"
17009,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","if we see a hook, we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it. I read"
17010,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",in every face I meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in
17011,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","regard to A.B., or that the friends of C.D. can hear something to his"
17012,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",disadvantage by application to such a one.
17013,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",
17014,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",It was to gratify the two great passions of asking and answering that
17015,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",epistolary correspondence was first invented. Letters (for by this
17016,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",usurped title epistles are now commonly known) are of several kinds.
17017,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","First, there are those which are not letters at all--as letters-patent,"
17018,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","letters dismissory, letters enclosing bills, letters of administration,"
17019,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","Pliny's letters, letters of diplomacy, of Cato, of Mentor, of Lords"
17020,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","Lyttelton, Chesterfield, and Orrery, of Jacob Behmen, Seneca (whom St."
17021,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","Jerome includes in his list of sacred writers), letters from abroad,"
17022,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","from sons in college to their fathers, letters of marque, and letters"
17023,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","generally, which are in no wise letters of mark. Second, are real"
17024,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","letters, such as those of Gray, Cowper, Walpole, Howell, Lamb, D.Y., the"
17025,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","first letters from children (printed in staggering capitals), Letters"
17026,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","from New York, letters of credit, and others, interesting for the sake"
17027,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",of the writer or the thing written. I have read also letters from Europe
17028,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","by a gentleman named Pinto, containing some curious gossip, and which I"
17029,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious. There are,"
17030,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","besides, letters addressed to posterity,--as epitaphs, for example,"
17031,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","written for their own monuments by monarchs, whereby we have lately"
17032,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",become possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings of
17033,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD","kings, hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable, but valuable to"
17034,"GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD",the student of the entirely dark ages. The letter of our Saviour to King

17168,P.S.,
17169,P.S.,"[And now of epistles candidatial, which are of two kinds,--namely,"
17170,P.S.,"letters of acceptance, and letters definitive of position. Our republic,"
17171,P.S.,"on the eve of an election, may safely enough be called a republic of"
17172,P.S.,"letters. Epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic, which seizes"
17173,P.S.,"one candidate after another, not seldom cutting short the thread of"
17174,P.S.,"political life. It has come to such a pass, that a party dreads less the"
17175,P.S.,attacks of its opponents than a letter from its candidate. _Litera
17176,P.S.,"scripta manet_, and it will go hard if something bad cannot be made of"
17177,P.S.,"it. General Harrison, it is well understood, was surrounded, during his"
17178,P.S.,"candidacy, with the _cordon sanitaire_ of a vigilance committee. No"
17179,P.S.,prisoner in Spielberg was ever more cautiously deprived of writing
17180,P.S.,materials. The soot was scraped carefully from the chimney-places;
17181,P.S.,outposts of expert rifle-shooters rendered it sure death for any goose
17182,P.S.,(who came clad in feathers) to approach within a certain limited
17183,P.S.,distance of North Bend; and all domestic fowls about the premises were
17184,P.S.,reduced to the condition of Plato's original man. By these precautions
17185,P.S.,"the General was saved. _Parva componere magnis_, I remember, that, when"
17186,P.S.,"party-spirit once ran high among my people, upon occasion of the choice"
17187,P.S.,"of a new deacon, I, having my preferences, yet not caring too openly to"
17188,P.S.,"express them, made use of an innocent fraud to bring about that result"
17189,P.S.,which I deemed most desirable. My stratagem was no other than the
17190,P.S.,throwing a copy of the Complete Letter-Writer in the way of the
17191,P.S.,"candidate whom I wished to defeat. He caught the infection, and"
17192,P.S.,"addressed a short note to his constituents, in which the opposite party"
17193,P.S.,detected so many and so grave improprieties (he had modelled it upon the
17194,P.S.,"letter of a young lady accepting a proposal of marriage), that he not"
17195,P.S.,"only lost his election, but, falling under a suspicion of Sabellianism"
17196,P.S.,and I know not what (the widow Endive assured me that he was a
17197,P.S.,"Paralipomenon, to her certain knowledge), was forced to leave the town."
17198,P.S.,Thus it is that the letter killeth.
17199,P.S.,
17200,P.S.,The object which candidates propose to themselves in writing is to
17201,P.S.,convey no meaning at all. And here is a quite unsuspected pitfall into
17202,P.S.,which they successively plunge headlong. For it is precisely in such
17203,P.S.,cryptographies that mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful
17204,P.S.,amount and variety of significance. _Omne ignotum pro mirifico_. How do
17205,P.S.,we admire at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts
17206,P.S.,"from Delphi, Hammon, and elsewhere, in only one of which can I so much"
17207,P.S.,"as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged; that, namely, wherein Apollo"
17208,P.S.,"confessed that he was mortal. One Didymus is, moreover, related to have"
17209,P.S.,"written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar, a topic"
17210,P.S.,"rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his successors, and which"
17211,P.S.,seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion as they
17212,P.S.,"can make nothing of it. A singular loadstone for theologians, also, is"
17213,P.S.,"the Beast in the Apocalypse, whereof, in the course of my studies, I"
17214,P.S.,"have noted two hundred and three several interpretations, each"
17215,P.S.,"lethiferal to all the rest. _Non nostrum est tantas componere lites_,"
17216,P.S.,"yet I have myself ventured upon a two hundred and fourth, which I"
17217,P.S.,embodied in a discourse preached on occasion of the demise of the late
17218,P.S.,"usurper, Napoleon Bonaparte, and which quieted, in a large measure, the"
17219,P.S.,minds of my people. It is true that my views on this important point
17220,P.S.,"were ardently controverted by Mr. Shearjashub Holden, the then preceptor"
17221,P.S.,"of our academy, and in other particulars a very deserving and sensible"
17222,P.S.,"young man, though possessing a somewhat limited knowledge of the Greek"
17223,P.S.,"tongue. But his heresy struck down no deep root, and, he having been"
17224,P.S.,"lately removed by the hand of Providence, I had the satisfaction of"
17225,P.S.,reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached upon the Lord's
17226,P.S.,day immediately succeeding his funeral. This might seem like taking an
17227,P.S.,"unfair advantage, did I not add that he had made provision in his last"
17228,P.S.,will (being celibate) for the publication of a posthumous tractate in
17229,P.S.,support of his own dangerous opinions.
17230,P.S.,
17231,P.S.,I know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so nearly to the
17232,P.S.,"ancient oracle as the letter of a Presidential candidate. Now, among the"
17233,P.S.,"Greeks, the eating of beans was strictly forbidden to all such as had it"
17234,P.S.,"in mind to consult those expert amphibologists, and this same"
17235,P.S.,prohibition on the part of Pythagoras to his disciples is understood to
17236,P.S.,"imply an abstinence from politics, beans having been used as ballots."
17237,P.S.,"That other explication, _quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi"
17238,P.S.,"existimaret_, though supported _pugnis et calcibus_ by many of the"
17239,P.S.,"learned, and not wanting the countenance of Cicero, is confuted by the"
17240,P.S.,"larger experience of New England. On the whole, I think it safer to"
17241,P.S.,apply here the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in
17242,P.S.,"regard to antique cosmogonies, myths, fables, proverbial expressions,"
17243,P.S.,"and knotty points generally, which is, to find a common-sense meaning,"
17244,P.S.,and then select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto. In
17245,P.S.,"this way we arrive at the conclusion, that the Greeks objected to the"
17246,P.S.,"questioning of candidates. And very properly, if, as I conceive, the"
17247,P.S.,"chief point be not to discover what a person in that position is, or"
17248,P.S.,"what he will do, but whether he can be elected. _Vos exemplaria Græca"
17249,P.S.,"nocturna versate manu, versate diurna_."
17250,P.S.,
17251,P.S.,"But, since an imitation of the Greeks in this particular (the asking of"
17252,P.S.,questions being one chief privilege of freemen) is hardly to be hoped
17253,P.S.,"for, and our candidates will answer, whether they are questioned or not,"
17254,P.S.,I would recommend that these ante-electionary dialogues should be
17255,P.S.,"carried on by symbols, as were the diplomatic correspondences of the"
17256,P.S.,"Scythians an Macrobii, or confined to the language of signs, like the"
17257,P.S.,famous interview of Panurge and Goatsnose. A candidate might then
17258,P.S.,"convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye,"
17259,P.S.,or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness to be speculated
17260,P.S.,upon by their respective constituencies. These answers would be
17261,P.S.,susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the
17262,P.S.,"political campaign might seem to demand, and the candidate could take"
17263,P.S.,"his position on either side of the fence with entire consistency. Or, if"
17264,P.S.,"letters must be written, profitable use might be made of the Dighton"
17265,P.S.,"rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script, every fresh decipherer of"
17266,P.S.,"which is enabled to educe a different meaning, whereby a sculptured"
17267,P.S.,"stone or two supplies us, and will probably continue to supply"
17268,P.S.,"posterity, with a very vast and various body of authentic history. For"
17269,P.S.,even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous.
17270,P.S.,There is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not
17271,P.S.,be detected in it. A severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of
17272,P.S.,"Cæsar's by two thirds, drawing his pen through the supererogatory"
17273,P.S.,"_veni_ and _vidi_. Perhaps, after all, the surest footing of hope is to"
17274,P.S.,be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of
17275,P.S.,"qualification in candidates. Already have statesmanship, experience, and"
17276,P.S.,"the possession (nay, the profession, even) of principles been rejected"
17277,P.S.,"as superfluous, and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability"
17278,P.S.,"to write will follow? At present, there may be death in pothooks as well"
17279,P.S.,"as pots, the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring, and all the"
17280,P.S.,dreadful heresies of Antislavery may lurk in a flourish.--H.W.]

17555,E.E.,E.E.
17556,E.E.,
17557,E.E.,
17558,E.E.,It should appear that Mr. Sawin found the actual feast curiously the
17559,E.E.,reverse of the bill of fare advertised in Faneuil Hall and other places.
17560,E.E.,His primary object seems to have been the making of his fortune.
17561,E.E.,"_Quærenda pecunia primum, virtus post nummos_. He hoisted sail for"
17562,E.E.,"Eldorado, and shipwrecked on Point Tribulation. _Quid, non mortalia"
17563,E.E.,"pectora cogis, auri sacra fames?_ The speculation has sometimes crossed"
17564,E.E.,"my mind, in that dreary interval of drought which intervenes between"
17565,E.E.,"quarterly stipendiary showers, that Providence, by the creation of a"
17566,E.E.,"money-tree, might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing"
17567,E.E.,"problem of human life. We read of bread-trees, the butter for which lies"
17568,E.E.,ready-churned in Irish bogs. Milk-trees we are assured of in South
17569,E.E.,"America, and stout Sir John Hawkins testifies to water-trees in the"
17570,E.E.,Canaries. Boot-trees bear abundantly in Lynn and elsewhere; and I have
17571,E.E.,"seen, in the entries of the wealthy, hat-trees with a fair show of"
17572,E.E.,"fruit. A family-tree I once cultivated myself, and found therefrom but a"
17573,E.E.,"scanty yield, and that quite tasteless and innutritious. Of trees"
17574,E.E.,bearing men we are not without examples; as those in the park of Louis
17575,E.E.,"the Eleventh of France. Who has forgotten, moreover, that olive-tree,"
17576,E.E.,"growing in the Athenian's back-garden, with its strange uxorious crop,"
17577,E.E.,"for the general propagation of which, as of a new and precious variety,"
17578,E.E.,"the philosopher Diogenes, hitherto uninterested in arboriculture, was so"
17579,E.E.,"zealous? In the _sylva_ of our own Southern States, the females of my"
17580,E.E.,family have called my attention to the china-tree. Not to multiply
17581,E.E.,"examples, I will barely add to my list the birch-tree, in the smaller"
17582,E.E.,branches of which has been implanted so miraculous a virtue for
17583,E.E.,"communicating the Latin and Greek languages, and which may well,"
17584,E.E.,"therefore, be classed among the trees producing necessaries of"
17585,E.E.,"life,--_venerabile donum fatalis virgæ_. That money-trees existed in"
17586,E.E.,the golden age there want not prevalent reasons for our believing. For
17587,E.E.,"does not the old proverb, when it asserts that money does not grow on"
17588,E.E.,"_every_ bush, imply _a fortiori_ that there were certain bushes which"
17589,E.E.,"did produce it? Again, there is another ancient saw to the effect that"
17590,E.E.,money is the _root_ of all evil. From which two adages it may be safe to
17591,E.E.,"infer that the aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub,"
17592,E.E.,"then absconded underground, and finally, in our iron age, vanished"
17593,E.E.,altogether. In favorable exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen
17594,E.E.,"or two survived to a great age, as in the garden of the Hesperides; and,"
17595,E.E.,"indeed, what else could that tree in the Sixth Æneid have been with a"
17596,E.E.,"branch whereof the Trojan hero procured admission to a territory, for"
17597,E.E.,the entering of which money is a surer passport than to a certain other
17598,E.E.,more profitable and too foreign kingdom? Whether these speculations of
17599,E.E.,"mine have any force in them, or whether they will not rather, by most"
17600,E.E.,"readers, be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand, is a question"
17601,E.E.,which I leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity. That there
17602,E.E.,"were, in more primitive and happier times, shops where money was"
17603,E.E.,"sold,--and that, too, on credit and at a bargain,--I take to be matter"
17604,E.E.,of demonstration. For what but a dealer in this article was that Æolus
17605,E.E.,who supplied Ulysses with motive-power for his fleet in bags? what that
17606,E.E.,"Ericus, King of Sweden, who is said to have kept the winds in his cap?"
17607,E.E.,"what, in more recent times, those Lapland Nornas who traded in favorable"
17608,E.E.,"breezes? All which will appear the more clearly when we consider, that,"
17609,E.E.,"even to this day, _raising the wind_ is proverbial for raising money,"
17610,E.E.,and that brokers and banks were invented by the Venetians at a later
17611,E.E.,period.
17612,E.E.,
17613,E.E.,And now for the improvement of this digression. I find a parallel to Mr.
17614,E.E.,"Sawin's fortune in an adventure of my own. For, shortly after I had"
17615,E.E.,first broached to myself the before-stated natural-historical and
17616,E.E.,"archæological theories, as I was passing, _haec negotia penitus mecum"
17617,E.E.,"revolvens_, through one of the obscure suburbs of our New England"
17618,E.E.,"metropolis, my eye was attracted by these words upon a signboard,--CHEAP"
17619,E.E.,"CASH-STORE. Here was at once the confirmation of my speculations, and"
17620,E.E.,"the substance of my hopes. Here lingered the fragment of a happier past,"
17621,E.E.,or stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more
17622,E.E.,"fortunate future. Thus glowed the distant Mexico to the eyes of Sawin,"
17623,E.E.,"as he looked through the dirty pane of the recruiting-office window, or"
17624,E.E.,speculated from the summit of that mirage-Pisgah which the imps of the
17625,E.E.,bottle are so cunning to raise up. Already had my Alnaschar-fancy (even
17626,E.E.,during that first half-believing glance) expended in various useful
17627,E.E.,directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the manuscript of a
17628,E.E.,proposed volume of discourses. Already did a clock ornament the tower of
17629,E.E.,"the Jaalam meeting-house, a gift appropriately, but modestly,"
17630,E.E.,"commemorated in the parish and town records, both, for now many years,"
17631,E.E.,kept by myself. Already had my son Seneca completed his course at the
17632,E.E.,"University. Whether, for the moment, we may not be considered as"
17633,E.E.,actually lording it over those Baratarias with the viceroyalty of which
17634,E.E.,"Hope invests us, and whether we are ever so warmly housed as in our"
17635,E.E.,"Spanish castles, would afford matter of argument. Enough that I found"
17636,E.E.,that signboard to be no other than a bait to the trap of a decayed
17637,E.E.,"grocer. Nevertheless, I bought a pound of dates (getting short weight by"
17638,E.E.,reason of immense flights of harpy flies who pursued and lighted upon
17639,E.E.,"their prey even in the very scales), which purchase I made not only with"
17640,E.E.,"an eye to the little ones at home, but also as a figurative reproof of"
17641,E.E.,"that too frequent habit of my mind, which, forgetting the due order of"
17642,E.E.,"chronology, will often persuade me that the happy sceptre of Saturn is"
17643,E.E.,stretched over this Astræa-forsaken nineteenth century.
17644,E.E.,
17645,E.E.,"Having glanced at the ledger of Glory under the title _Sawin, B._, let"
17646,E.E.,"us extend our investigations, and discover if that instructive volume"
17647,E.E.,does not contain some charges more personally interesting to ourselves.
17648,E.E.,"I think we should be more economical of our resources, did we thoroughly"
17649,E.E.,"appreciate the fact, that, whenever Brother Jonathan seems to be"
17650,E.E.,"thrusting his hand into his own pocket, he is, in fact, picking ours. I"
17651,E.E.,confess that the late _muck_ which the country has been running has
17652,E.E.,materially changed my views as to the best method of raising revenue.
17653,E.E.,"If, by means of direct taxation, the bills for every extraordinary"
17654,E.E.,"outlay were brought under our immediate eye, so that, like thrifty"
17655,E.E.,"housekeepers, we could see where and how fast the money was going, we"
17656,E.E.,"should be less likely to commit extravagances. At present, these things"
17657,E.E.,"are managed in such a hugger-mugger way, that we know not what we pay"
17658,E.E.,"for; the poor man is charged as much as the rich; and, while we are"
17659,E.E.,"saving and scrimping at the spigot, the government is drawing off at the"
17660,E.E.,bung. If we could know that a part of the money we expend for tea and
17661,E.E.,"coffee goes to buy powder and balls, and that it is Mexican blood which"
17662,E.E.,"makes the clothes on our backs more costly, it would set some of us"
17663,E.E.,"athinking. During the present fall, I have often pictured to myself a"
17664,E.E.,government official entering my study and handing me the following
17665,E.E.,bill:--
17666,E.E.,

17709,E.E.,"glory. For me, I have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable"
17710,E.E.,tricks. It happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home
17711,E.E.,"from his day's work, and forthwith my imagination puts a cocked-hat upon"
17712,E.E.,"his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders, and sets him up as a"
17713,E.E.,"candidate for the Presidency. So, also, on a recent public occasion, as"

17772,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",It may be supposed that we of Jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of

18031,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"[Here, patient reader, we take leave of each other, I trust with some"
18032,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"mutual satisfaction. I say _patient_, for I love not that kind which"
18033,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"skims dippingly over the surface of the page, as swallows over a pool"
18034,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,before rain. By such no pearls shall be gathered. But if no pearls there
18035,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"be (as, indeed the world is not without example of books wherefrom the"
18036,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,longest-winded diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful of
18037,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"mud), yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward adequate"
18038,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"perseverance. If neither pearls nor oysters, yet is patience itself a"
18039,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,gem worth diving deeply for.
18040,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,
18041,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,It may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by my own
18042,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"private lucubrations, and some may be fain to bring against me that old"
18043,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,jest of him who preached all his hearers out of the meeting-house save
18044,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"only the sexton, who, remaining for yet a little space, from a sense of"
18045,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"official duty, at last gave out also, and, presenting the keys, humbly"
18046,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"requested our preacher to lock the doors, when he should have wholly"
18047,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,relieved himself of his testimony. I confess to a satisfaction in the
18048,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"self act of preaching, nor do I esteem a discourse to be wholly thrown"
18049,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent auditory. I cannot easily
18050,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"believe that the Gospel of Saint John, which Jacques Cartier ordered to"
18051,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"be read in the Latin tongue to the Canadian savages, upon his first"
18052,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"meeting with them, fell altogether upon stony ground. For the"
18053,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest
18054,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,intellects and most alien ears. In this wise did Episcopius convert many
18055,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"to his opinions, who yet understood not the language in which he"
18056,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,discoursed. The chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an
18057,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,authentic message to deliver. For counterfeit messengers that mode of
18058,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,treatment which Father John de Plano Carpini relates to have prevailed
18059,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"among the Tartars would seem effectual, and, perhaps, deserved enough."
18060,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"For my own part, I may lay claim to so much of the spirit of martyrdom"
18061,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,as would have led me to go into banishment with those clergymen whom
18062,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,Alphonso the Sixth of Portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to
18063,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"shorten their pulpit eloquence. It is possible, that, I having been"
18064,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"invited into my brother Biglow's desk, I may have been too little"
18065,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a
18066,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the desire of
18067,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,hearing him.
18068,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,
18069,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,I am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization
18070,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"which impels me, like the railroad-engine with its train of cars, to run"
18071,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,backward for a short distance in order to obtain a fairer start. I may
18072,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"compare myself to one fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high,"
18073,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"who, misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting of some"
18074,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"larger fish, jerks suddenly, and finds that he has _caught bottom_,"
18075,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"hauling in upon the end of his line a trail of various _algæ_, among"
18076,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"which, nevertheless, the naturalist may haply find somewhat to repay the"
18077,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,disappointment of the angler. Yet have I conscientiously endeavored to
18078,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age, daily degenerating more"
18079,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,and more from the high standard of our pristine New England. To the
18080,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,catalogue of lost arts I would mournfully add also that of listening to
18081,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,two-hour sermons. Surely we have been abridged into a race of pygmies.
18082,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"For, truly, in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in"
18083,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"print, the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be"
18084,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"likened to nothing so exactly as to the vertebræ of the saurians,"
18085,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,whence the theorist may conjecture a race of Anakim proportionate to the
18086,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"withstanding of these other monsters. I say Anakim rather than Nephelim,"
18087,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,because there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those whose
18088,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,heads (though no giants) are constantly enveloped in clouds (which that
18089,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,name imports) will never become extinct. The attempt to vanquish the
18090,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,innumerable _heads_ of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply
18091,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"us with a plausible interpretation of the second labor of Hercules, and"
18092,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful precedent.
18093,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,
18094,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"But while I lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard, I cannot"
18095,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"refuse to succumb to its influence. Looking out through my study-window,"
18096,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"I see Mr. Biglow at a distance busy in gathering his Baldwins, of which,"
18097,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"to judge by the number of barrels lying about under the trees, his crop"
18098,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"is more abundant than my own,--by which sight I am admonished to turn to"
18099,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,"those orchards of the mind wherein my labors may be more prospered, and"
18100,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,apply myself diligently to the preparation of my next Sabbath's
18101,BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN.,discourse.--H.W.]

18162,JASMIN.,Introduction is so distinctly an essay that it has been thought best to
18163,JASMIN.,"print it as an appendix to this volume, rather than allow it to break in"
18164,JASMIN.,"upon the pages of verse. There is, however, one passage in it which may"

18171,JASMIN.,was in _The Courtin'_. While the introduction to the First Series was
18172,JASMIN.,"going through the press, I received word from the printer that there was"
18173,JASMIN.,a blank page left which must be filled. I sat down at once and
18174,JASMIN.,"improvised another fictitious ""notice of the press,"" in which, because"
18175,JASMIN.,"verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose, I inserted an extract"
18176,JASMIN.,"from a supposed ballad of Mr. Biglow. I kept no copy of it, and the"
18177,JASMIN.,"printer, as directed, cut it off when the gap was filled. Presently I"
18178,JASMIN.,"began to receive letters asking for the rest of it, sometimes for the"
18179,JASMIN.,"_balance_ of it. I had none, but to answer such demands, I patched a"
18180,JASMIN.,conclusion upon it in a later edition. Those who had only the first
18181,JASMIN.,"continued to importune me. Afterward, being asked to write it out as an"
18182,JASMIN.,"autograph for the Baltimore Sanitary Commission Fair, I added other"
18183,JASMIN.,"verses, into some of which I infused a little more sentiment in a homely"
18184,JASMIN.,"way, and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters and"
18185,JASMIN.,"making a connected story. Most likely I have spoiled it, but I shall put"
18186,JASMIN.,"it at the end of this Introduction, to answer once for all those kindly"
18187,JASMIN.,importunings.'

18331,AFORESAID,It is not from any idle wish to obtrude my humble person with undue
18332,AFORESAID,prominence upon the publick view that I resume my pen upon the present
18333,AFORESAID,occasion. _Juniores ad labores_. But having been a main instrument in
18334,AFORESAID,rescuing the talent of my young parishioner from being buried in the
18335,AFORESAID,"ground, by giving it such warrant with the world as could be derived"
18336,AFORESAID,from a name already widely known by several printed discourses (all of
18337,AFORESAID,which I may be permitted without immodesty to state have been deemed
18338,AFORESAID,worthy of preservation in the Library of Harvard College by my esteemed
18339,AFORESAID,"friend Mr. Sibley), it seemed becoming that I should not only testify to"
18340,AFORESAID,"the genuineness of the following production, but call attention to it,"
18341,AFORESAID,the more as Mr. Biglow had so long been silent as to be in danger of
18342,AFORESAID,absolute oblivion. I insinuate no claim to any share in the authorship
18343,AFORESAID,"(_vix ea nostra voco_) of the works already published by Mr. Biglow, but"
18344,AFORESAID,merely take to myself the credit of having fulfilled toward them the
18345,AFORESAID,"office of taster (_experto crede_), who, having first tried, could"
18346,AFORESAID,"afterward bear witness (_credenzen_ it was aptly named by the Germans),"
18347,AFORESAID,"an office always arduous, and sometimes even dangerous, as in the case"
18348,AFORESAID,of those devoted persons who venture their lives in the deglutition of
18349,AFORESAID,"patent medicines (_dolus latet in generalibus_, there is deceit in the"
18350,AFORESAID,most of them) and thereafter are wonderfully preserved long enough to
18351,AFORESAID,append their signatures to testimonials in the diurnal and hebdomadal
18352,AFORESAID,prints. I say not this as covertly glancing at the authors of certain
18353,AFORESAID,manuscripts which have been submitted to my literary judgment (though an
18354,AFORESAID,"epick in twenty-four books on the 'Taking of Jericho' might, save for"
18355,AFORESAID,the prudent forethought of Mrs. Wilbur in secreting the same just as I
18356,AFORESAID,had arrived beneath the walls and was beginning a catalogue of the
18357,AFORESAID,"various horns and their blowers, too ambitiously emulous in longanimity"
18358,AFORESAID,"of Homer's list of ships, might, I say, have rendered frustrate any hope"
18359,AFORESAID,"I could entertain _vacare Musis_ for the small remainder of my days),"
18360,AFORESAID,but only the further to secure myself against any imputation of unseemly
18361,AFORESAID,"forthputting. I will barely subjoin, in this connexion, that, whereas"
18362,AFORESAID,"Job was left to desire, in the soreness of his heart, that his adversary"
18363,AFORESAID,"had written a book, as perchance misanthropically wishing to indite a"
18364,AFORESAID,"review thereof, yet was not Satan allowed so far to tempt him as to send"
18365,AFORESAID,"Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar each with an unprinted work in his wallet to"
18366,AFORESAID,be submitted to his censure. But of this enough. Were I in need of other
18367,AFORESAID,"excuse, I might add that I write by the express desire of Mr. Biglow"
18368,AFORESAID,"himself, whose entire winter leisure is occupied, as he assures me, in"
18369,AFORESAID,"answering demands for autographs, a labor exacting enough in itself, and"
18370,AFORESAID,"egregiously so to him, who, being no ready penman, cannot sign so much"
18371,AFORESAID,"as his name without strange contortions of the face (his nose, even,"
18372,AFORESAID,being essential to complete success) and painfully suppressed
18373,AFORESAID,"Saint-Vitus-dance of every muscle in his body. This, with his having"
18374,AFORESAID,"been put in the Commission of the Peace by our excellent Governor (_O,"
18375,AFORESAID,"si sic omnes!_) immediately on his accession to office, keeps him"
18376,AFORESAID,"continually employed. _Haud inexpertus loquor_, having for many years"
18377,AFORESAID,"written myself J.P., and being not seldom applied to for specimens of my"
18378,AFORESAID,"chirography, a request to which I have sometimes over weakly assented,"
18379,AFORESAID,believing as I do that nothing written of set purpose can properly be
18380,AFORESAID,"called an autograph, but only those unpremeditated sallies and lively"
18381,AFORESAID,runnings which betray the fireside Man instead of the hunted Notoriety
18382,AFORESAID,doubling on his pursuers. But it is time that I should bethink me of St.
18383,AFORESAID,"Austin's prayer, _libera me a meipso_, if I would arrive at the matter"
18384,AFORESAID,in hand.
18385,AFORESAID,
18386,AFORESAID,"Moreover, I had yet another reason for taking up the pen myself. I am"
18387,AFORESAID,informed that 'The Atlantic Monthly' is mainly indebted for its success
18388,AFORESAID,"to the contributions and editorial supervision of Dr. Holmes, whose"
18389,AFORESAID,excellent 'Annals of America' occupy an honored place upon my shelves.
18390,AFORESAID,"The journal itself I have never seen; but if this be so, it might seem"
18391,AFORESAID,that the recommendation of a brother-clergyman (though _par magis quam
18392,AFORESAID,similis_) should carry a greater weight. I suppose that you have a
18393,AFORESAID,"department for historical lucubrations, and should be glad, if deemed"
18394,AFORESAID,"desirable, to forward for publication my 'Collections for the"
18395,AFORESAID,"Antiquities of Jaalam,' and my (now happily complete) pedigree of the"
18396,AFORESAID,"Wilbur family from its _fons et origo_, the Wild Boar of Ardennes."
18397,AFORESAID,Withdrawn from the active duties of my profession by the settlement of a
18398,AFORESAID,"colleague-pastor, the Reverend Jeduthun Hitchcock, formerly of Brutus"
18399,AFORESAID,"Four-Corners, I might find time for further contributions to general"
18400,AFORESAID,literature on similar topicks. I have made large advances towards a
18401,AFORESAID,"completer genealogy of Mrs. Wilbur's family, the Pilcoxes, not, if I"
18402,AFORESAID,"know myself, from any idle vanity, but with the sole desire of rendering"
18403,AFORESAID,myself useful in my day and generation. _Nulla dies sine lineâ_. I
18404,AFORESAID,"inclose a meteorological register, a list of the births, deaths, and"
18405,AFORESAID,"marriages, and a few _memorabilia_ of longevity in Jaalam East Parish"
18406,AFORESAID,for the last half-century. Though spared to the unusual period of more
18407,AFORESAID,"than eighty years, I find no diminution of my faculties or abatement of"
18408,AFORESAID,"my natural vigor, except a scarcely sensible decay of memory and a"
18409,AFORESAID,necessity of recurring to younger eyesight or spectacles for the finer
18410,AFORESAID,print in Cruden. It would gratify me to make some further provision for
18411,AFORESAID,declining years from the emoluments of my literary labors. I had
18412,AFORESAID,"intended to effect an insurance on my life, but was deterred therefrom"
18413,AFORESAID,"by a circular from one of the offices, in which the sudden death of so"
18414,AFORESAID,"large a proportion of the insured was set forth as an inducement, that"
18415,AFORESAID,it seemed to me little less than a tempting of Providence. _Neque in
18416,AFORESAID,"summâ inopiâ levis esse senectus potest, ne sapienti quidem_."
18417,AFORESAID,
18418,AFORESAID,Thus far concerning Mr. Biglow; and so much seemed needful (_brevis esse
18419,AFORESAID,"laboro_) by way of preliminary, after a silence of fourteen years. He"
18420,AFORESAID,"greatly fears lest he may in this essay have fallen below himself, well"
18421,AFORESAID,"knowing that, if exercise be dangerous on a full stomach, no less so is"
18422,AFORESAID,"writing on a full reputation. Beset as he has been on all sides, he"
18423,AFORESAID,"could not refrain, and would only imprecate patience till he shall again"
18424,AFORESAID,have 'got the hang' (as he calls it) of an accomplishment long disused.
18425,AFORESAID,"The letter of Mr. Sawin was received some time in last June, and others"
18426,AFORESAID,have followed which will in due season be submitted to the publick. How
18427,AFORESAID,"largely his statements are to be depended on, I more than merely"
18428,AFORESAID,dubitate. He was always distinguished for a tendency to
18429,AFORESAID,"exaggeration,--it might almost be qualified by a stronger term."
18430,AFORESAID,"_Fortiter mentire, aliquid hæret_ seemed to be his favorite rule of"
18431,AFORESAID,rhetoric. That he is actually where he says he is the postmark would
18432,AFORESAID,seem to confirm; that he was received with the publick demonstrations he
18433,AFORESAID,describes would appear consonant with what we know of the habits of
18434,AFORESAID,those regions; but further than this I venture not to decide. I have
18435,AFORESAID,sometimes suspected a vein of humor in him which leads him to speak by
18436,AFORESAID,"contraries; but since, in the unrestrained intercourse of private life,"
18437,AFORESAID,"I have never observed in him any striking powers of invention, I am the"
18438,AFORESAID,more willing to put a certain qualified faith in the incidents and the
18439,AFORESAID,details of life and manners which give to his narratives some portion of
18440,AFORESAID,the interest and entertainment which characterizes a Century Sermon.
18441,AFORESAID,
18442,AFORESAID,It may be expected of me that I should say something to justify myself
18443,AFORESAID,with the world for a seeming inconsistency with my well-known principles
18444,AFORESAID,"in allowing my youngest son to raise a company for the war, a fact known"
18445,AFORESAID,to all through the medium of the publick prints. I did reason with the
18446,AFORESAID,"young man, but _expellas naturam furcâ tamen usque recurrit_. Having"
18447,AFORESAID,"myself been a chaplain in 1812, I could the less wonder that a man of"
18448,AFORESAID,"war had sprung from my loins. It was, indeed, grievous to send my"
18449,AFORESAID,"Benjamin, the child of my old age; but after the discomfiture of"
18450,AFORESAID,"Manassas, I with my own hands did buckle on his armor, trusting in the"
18451,AFORESAID,great Comforter and Commander for strength according to my need. For
18452,AFORESAID,truly the memory of a brave son dead in his shroud were a greater staff
18453,AFORESAID,of my declining years than a living coward (if those may be said to have
18454,AFORESAID,"lived who carry all of themselves into the grave with them), though his"
18455,AFORESAID,"days might be long in the land, and he should get much goods. It is not"
18456,AFORESAID,till our earthen vessels are broken that we find and truly possess the
18457,AFORESAID,"treasure that was laid up in them. _Migravi in animam meam_, I have"
18458,AFORESAID,sought refuge in my own soul; nor would I be shamed by the heathen
18459,AFORESAID,"comedian with his _Neqwam illud verbum, bene vult, nisi bene facit_."
18460,AFORESAID,"During our dark days, I read constantly in the inspired book of Job,"
18461,AFORESAID,which I believe to contain more food to maintain the fibre of the soul
18462,AFORESAID,"for right living and high thinking than all pagan literature together,"
18463,AFORESAID,though I would by no means vilipend the study of the classicks. There I
18464,AFORESAID,"read that Job said in his despair, even as the fool saith in his heart"
18465,AFORESAID,"there is no God,--'The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that"
18466,AFORESAID,provoke God are secure.' (Job xii. 6.) But I sought farther till I found
18467,AFORESAID,"this Scripture also, which I would have those perpend who have striven"
18468,AFORESAID,to turn our Israel aside to the worship of strange gods.--'If I did
18469,AFORESAID,"despise the cause of my manservant or of my maid-servant, when they"
18470,AFORESAID,"contended with me, what then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he"
18471,AFORESAID,"visiteth, what shall I answer him?' (Job xxxi. 13, 14.) On this text I"
18472,AFORESAID,preached a discourse on the last day of Fasting and Humiliation with
18473,AFORESAID,"general acceptance, though there were not wanting one or two Laodiceans"
18474,AFORESAID,who said that I should have waited till the President announced his
18475,AFORESAID,"policy. But let us hope and pray, remembering this of Saint Gregory,"
18476,AFORESAID,"_Vult Deus rogari, vult cogi, vult quâdam importunitate vinci_."

18479,AFORESAID,backward this fall. A singular circumstance occurred in this town on the

18827,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"super foco ligna reponens_, is a rule for the young, whose woodpile is"

18829,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,best thing to keep an old man's shoulders from shivering at every
18830,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,breath of sorrow or ill-fortune. But methinks it were easier for an old
18831,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,man to feel the disadvantages of youth than the advantages of age. Of
18832,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,these latter I reckon one of the chiefest to be this: that we attach a
18833,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"less inordinate value to our own productions, and, distrusting daily"
18834,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,more and more our own wisdom (with the conceit whereof at twenty we wrap
18835,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ourselves away from knowledge as with a garment), do reconcile ourselves"
18836,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"with the wisdom of God. I could have wished, indeed, that room might"
18837,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,have been made for the residue of the anecdote relating to Deacon

18839,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,part of the publick (as I have reason to know from several letters of
18840,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"inquiry already received), but would also, as I think, have largely"
18841,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,increased the circulation of your Magazine in this town. _Nihil humani

18844,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,fitting season.
18845,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18846,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"As touching the following literary effort of Esquire Biglow, much might"
18847,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"be profitably said on the topick of Idyllick and Pastoral Poetry, and"
18848,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"concerning the proper distinctions to be made between them, from"
18849,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Theocritus, the inventor of the former, to Collins, the latest authour I"
18850,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,know of who has emulated the classicks in the latter style. But in the
18851,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"time of a Civil War worthy a Milton to defend and a Lucan to sing, it"
18852,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"may be reasonably doubted whether the publick, never too studious of"
18853,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"serious instruction, might not consider other objects more deserving of"
18854,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"present attention. Concerning the title of Idyll, which Mr. Biglow has"
18855,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"adopted at my suggestion, it may not be improper to animadvert, that the"
18856,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"name properly signifies a poem somewhat rustick in phrase (for, though"
18857,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the learned are not agreed as to the particular dialect employed by
18858,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Theocritus, they are universanimous both as to its rusticity and its"
18859,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,capacity of rising now and then to the level of more elevated sentiments
18860,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"and expressions), while it is also descriptive of real scenery and"
18861,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,manners. Yet it must be admitted that the production now in question
18862,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,(which here and there bears perhaps too plainly the marks of my
18863,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"correcting hand) does partake of the nature of a Pastoral, inasmuch as"
18864,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the interlocutors therein are purely imaginary beings, and the whole is"
18865,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"little better than [Greek: kapnou skias onar]. The plot was, as I"
18866,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"believe, suggested by the 'Twa Brigs' of Robert Burns, a Scottish poet"
18867,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"of the last century, as that found its prototype in the 'Mutual"
18868,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Complaint of Plainstanes and Causey' by Fergusson, though, the metre of"

18871,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,parishioner and friend that Concord Bridge had long since yielded to the
18872,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,edacious tooth of Time. But he answered me to this effect: that there
18873,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,was no greater mistake of an authour than to suppose the reader had no
18874,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"fancy of his own; that, if once that faculty was to be called into"
18875,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"activity, it were _better_ to be in for the whole sheep than the"
18876,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"shoulder; and that he knew Concord like a book,--an expression"
18877,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"questionable in propriety, since there are few things with which he is"
18878,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,not more familiar than with the printed page. In proof of what he
18879,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"affirmed, he showed me some verses which with others he had stricken"
18880,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"out as too much delaying the action, but which I communicate in this"
18881,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,place because they rightly define 'punkin-seed' (which Mr. Bartlett
18882,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"would have a kind of perch,--a creature to which I have found a rod or"
18883,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,pole not to be so easily equivalent in our inland waters as in the books
18884,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of arithmetic) and because it conveys an eulogium on the worthy son of
18885,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"an excellent father, with whose acquaintance (_eheu, fugaces anni!_) I"
18886,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,was formerly honoured.

18888,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"'But nowadays the Bridge ain't wut they show,"
18889,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"So much ez Em'son, Hawthorne, an' Thoreau."
18890,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"I know the village, though; was sent there once"
18891,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"A-schoolin', 'cause to home I played the dunce;"
18892,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"An' I 've ben sence a visitin' the Jedge,"

18900,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18901,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Concerning the subject-matter of the verses. I have not the leisure at
18902,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"present to write so fully as I could wish, my time being occupied with"
18903,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the preparation of a discourse for the forthcoming bicentenary
18904,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,celebration of the first settlement of Jaalam East Parish. It may
18905,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"gratify the publick interest to mention the circumstance, that my"
18906,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,investigations to this end have enabled me to verify the fact (of much
18907,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"historick importance, and hitherto hotly debated) that Shearjashub"
18908,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Tarbox was the first child of white parentage born in this town, being"
18909,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"named in his father's will under date August 7th, or 9th, 1662. It is"
18910,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,well known that those who advocate the claims of Mehetable Goings are
18911,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,unable to find any trace of her existence prior to October of that year.
18912,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"As respects the settlement of the Mason and Slidell question, Mr. Biglow"
18913,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"has not incorrectly stated the popular sentiment, so far as I can judge"
18914,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"by its expression in this locality. For myself, I feel more sorrow than"
18915,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,resentment: for I am old enough to have heard those talk of England who
18916,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"still, even after the unhappy estrangement, could not unschool their"
18917,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,lips from calling her the Mother-Country. But England has insisted on
18918,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ripping up old wounds, and has undone the healing work of fifty years;"
18919,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"for nations do not reason, they only feel, and the _spretæ injuria"
18920,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,formæ_ rankles in their minds as bitterly as in that of a woman. And
18921,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"because this is so, I feel the more satisfaction that our Government has"
18922,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"acted (as all Governments should, standing as they do between the people"
18923,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and their passions) as if it had arrived at years of discretion. There
18924,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"are three short and simple words, the hardest of all to pronounce in any"
18925,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,language (and I suspect they were no easier before the confusion of
18926,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"tongues), but which no man or nation that cannot utter can claim to have"
18927,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"arrived at manhood. Those words are, _I was wrong;_ and I am proud that,"
18928,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"while England played the boy, our rulers had strength enough from the"
18929,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,People below and wisdom enough from God above to quit themselves like
18930,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,men.
18931,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18932,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,The sore points on both sides have been skilfully exasperated by
18933,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"interested and unscrupulous persons, who saw in a war between the two"
18934,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,countries the only hope of profitable return for their investment in
18935,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Confederate stock, whether political or financial. The always"
18936,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"supercilious, often insulting, and sometimes even brutal tone of British"
18937,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,journals and publick men has certainly not tended to soothe whatever
18938,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,resentment might exist in America.
18939,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18940,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"'Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,"
18941,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,But why did you kick me down stairs?'
18942,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18943,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"We have no reason to complain that England, as a necessary consequence"
18944,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"of her clubs, has become a great society for the minding of other"
18945,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"people's business, and we can smile good-naturedly when she lectures"
18946,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,other nations on the sins of arrogance and conceit: but we may justly
18947,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,consider it a breach of the political _convenances_ which are expected
18948,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"to regulate the intercourse of one well-bred government with another,"
18949,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,when men holding places in the ministry allow themselves to dictate our
18950,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"domestic policy, to instruct us in our duty, and to stigmatize as unholy"
18951,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,a war for the rescue of whatever a high-minded people should hold most
18952,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"vital and most sacred. Was it in good taste, that I may use the mildest"
18953,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"term, for Earl Russell to expound our own Constitution to President"
18954,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Lincoln, or to make a new and fallacious application of an old phrase"
18955,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"for our benefit, and tell us that the Rebels were fighting for"
18956,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,independence and we for empire? As if all wars for independence were by
18957,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"nature just and deserving of sympathy, and all wars for empire ignoble"
18958,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"and worthy only of reprobation, or as if these easy phrases in any way"
18959,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"characterized this terrible struggle,--terrible not so truly in any"
18960,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"superficial sense, as from the essential and deadly enmity of the"
18961,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,principles that underlie it. His Lordship's bit of borrowed rhetoric
18962,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"would justify Smith O'Brien, Nana Sahib, and the Maori chieftains, while"
18963,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,it would condemn nearly every war in which England has ever been
18964,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,engaged. Was it so very presumptuous in us to think that it would be
18965,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,decorous in English statesmen if they spared time enough to acquire some
18966,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"kind of knowledge, though of the most elementary kind, in regard to this"
18967,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"country and the questions at issue here, before they pronounced so"
18968,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,off-hand a judgment? Or is political information expected to come
18969,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Dogberry-fashion in England, like reading and writing, by nature?"
18970,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
18971,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"And now all respectable England is wondering at our irritability, and"
18972,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,sees a quite satisfactory explanation of it in our national vanity.
18973,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"_Suave mari magno_, it is pleasant, sitting in the easy-chairs of"
18974,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Downing Street, to sprinkle pepper on the raw wounds of a kindred people"
18975,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"struggling for life, and philosophical to find in self-conceit the cause"
18976,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of our instinctive resentment. Surely we were of all nations the least
18977,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,liable to any temptation of vanity at a time when the gravest anxiety
18978,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and the keenest sorrow were never absent from our hearts. Nor is conceit
18979,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the exclusive attribute of any one nation. The earliest of English
18980,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"travellers, Sir John Mandeville, took a less provincial view of the"
18981,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"matter when he said, 'For fro what partie of the erthe that men duellen,"
18982,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"other aboven or beneathen, it semethe alweys to hem that duellen that"
18983,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,thei gon more righte than any other folke.' The English have always had
18984,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"their fair share of this amiable quality. We may say of them still, as"
18985,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the authour of the 'Lettres Cabalistiques' said of them more than a
18986,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"century ago, _'Ces derniers disent naturellement qu'il n'y a qu'eux qui"
18987,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"soient estimables_'. And, as he also says,_'J'aimerois presque autant"
18988,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,tomber entre les mains d'un Inquisiteur que d'un Anglois qui me fait
18989,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sentir sans cesse combien il s'estime plus que moi, et qui ne daigne me"
18990,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,parler que pour injurier ma Nation et pour m'ennuyer du récit des
18991,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,grandes qualités de la sienne_.' Of _this_ Bull we may safely say with
18992,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Horace, _habet fænum in cornu._ What we felt to be especially insulting"
18993,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,was the quiet assumption that the descendants of men who left the Old
18994,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"World for the sake of principle, and who had made the wilderness into a"
18995,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"New World patterned after an Idea, could not possibly be susceptible of"
18996,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"a generous or lofty sentiment, could have no feeling of nationality"
18997,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"deeper than that of a tradesman for his shop. One would have thought, in"
18998,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"listening to England, that we were presumptuous in fancying that we were"
18999,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"a nation at all, or had any other principle of union than that of booths"
19000,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"at a fair, where there is no higher notion of government than the"
19001,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"constable, or better image of God than that stamped upon the current"
19002,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,coin.
19003,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19004,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,It is time for Englishmen to consider whether there was nothing in the
19005,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,spirit of their press and of their leading public men calculated to
19006,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"rouse a just indignation, and to cause a permanent estrangement on the"
19007,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"part of any nation capable of self-respect, and sensitively jealous, as"
19008,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ours then was, of foreign interference. Was there nothing in the"
19009,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,indecent haste with which belligerent rights were conceded to the
19010,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Rebels, nothing in the abrupt tone assumed in the Trent case, nothing in"
19011,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the fitting out of Confederate privateers, that might stir the blood of"
19012,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"a people already overcharged with doubt, suspicion, and terrible"
19013,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,responsibility? The laity in any country do not stop to consider points
19014,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"of law, but they have an instinctive perception of the _animus_ that"
19015,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,actuates the policy of a foreign nation; and in our own case they
19016,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,remembered that the British authorities in Canada did not wait till
19017,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,diplomacy could send home to England for her slow official tinder-box to
19018,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"fire the 'Caroline.' Add to this, what every sensible American knew,"
19019,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,that the moral support of England was equal to an army of two hundred
19020,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"thousand men to the Rebels, while it insured us another year or two of"
19021,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,exhausting war. It was not so much the spite of her words (though the
19022,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,time might have been more tastefully chosen) as the actual power for
19023,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,evil in them that we felt as a deadly wrong. Perhaps the most immediate
19024,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"and efficient cause of mere irritation was, the sudden and unaccountable"
19025,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"change of manner on the other side of the water. Only six months before,"
19026,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the Prince of Wales had come over to call us cousins; and everywhere it
19027,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"was nothing but 'our American brethren,' that great offshoot of British"
19028,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"institutions in the New World, so almost identical with them in laws,"
19029,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"language, and literature,--this last of the alliterative compliments"
19030,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"being so bitterly true, that perhaps it will not be retracted even now."
19031,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,To this outburst of long-repressed affection we responded with genuine
19032,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"warmth, if with something of the awkwardness of a poor relation"
19033,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,bewildered with the sudden tightening of the ties of consanguinity when
19034,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,it is rumored that he has come into a large estate. Then came the
19035,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Rebellion, and, _presto!_ a flaw in our titles was discovered, the plate"
19036,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"we were promised at the family table is flung at our head, and we were"
19037,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"again the scum of creation, intolerably vulgar, at once cowardly and"
19038,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"overbearing,--no relations of theirs, after all, but a dreggy hybrid of"
19039,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the basest bloods of Europe. Panurge was not quicker to call Friar John
19040,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,his _former_ friend. I cannot help thinking of Walter Mapes's jingling
19041,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"paraphrase of Petronius,--"
19042,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19043,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"'Dummodo sim splendidis vestibus ornatus,"
19044,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Et multa familia sim circumvallatus,"
19045,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Prudens sum et sapiens et morigeratus,"
19046,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Et tuus nepos sum et tu meus cognatus,'--"
19047,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19048,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,which I may freely render thus:--
19049,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19050,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"So long as I was prosperous, I'd dinners by the dozen,"
19051,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Was well-bred, witty, virtuous, and everybody's cousin;"
19052,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"If luck should turn, as well she may, her fancy is so flexile,"
19053,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Will virtue, cousinship, and all return with her from exile?"
19054,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19055,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"There was nothing in all this to exasperate a philosopher, much to make"
19056,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,him smile rather; but the earth's surface is not chiefly inhabited by
19057,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"philosophers, and I revive the recollection of it now in perfect"
19058,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"good-humour, merely by way of suggesting to our _ci-devant_ British"
19059,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"cousins, that it would have been easier for them to hold their tongues"
19060,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,than for us to keep our tempers under the circumstances.
19061,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19062,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"The English Cabinet made a blunder, unquestionably, in taking it so"
19063,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,hastily for granted that the United States had fallen forever from their
19064,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"position as a first-rate power, and it was natural that they should vent"
19065,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,a little of their vexation on the people whose inexplicable obstinacy in
19066,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"maintaining freedom and order, and in resisting degradation, was likely"
19067,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to convict them of their mistake. But if bearing a grudge be the sure
19068,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"mark of a small mind in the individual, can it be a proof of high spirit"
19069,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,in a nation? If the result of the present estrangement between the two
19070,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,countries shall be to make us more independent of British twaddle
19071,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"(_Indomito nec dira ferens stipendia Tauro_), so much the better; but if"
19072,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,it is to make us insensible to the value of British opinion in matters
19073,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"where it gives us the judgment of an impartial and cultivated outsider,"
19074,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"if we are to shut ourselves out from the advantages of English culture,"
19075,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the loss will be ours, and not theirs. Because the door of the old"
19076,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"homestead has been once slammed in our faces, shall we in a huff reject"
19077,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"all future advances of conciliation, and cut ourselves foolishly off"
19078,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"from any share in the humanizing influences of the place, with its"
19079,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ineffable riches of association, its heirlooms of immemorial culture,"
19080,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"its historic monuments, ours no less than theirs, its noble gallery of"
19081,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ancestral portraits? We have only to succeed, and England will not only"
19082,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"respect, but, for the first time, begin to understand us. And let us"
19083,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"not, in our justifiable indignation at wanton insult, forget that"
19084,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,England is not the England only of snobs who dread the democracy they do
19085,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"not comprehend, but the England of history, of heroes, statesmen, and"
19086,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"poets, whose names are dear, and their influence as salutary to us as to"
19087,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,her.
19088,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19089,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Let us strengthen the hands of those in authority over us, and curb our"
19090,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"own tongues, remembering that General Wait commonly proves in the end"
19091,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"more than a match for General Headlong, and that the Good Book ascribes"
19092,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"safety to a multitude, indeed, but not to a mob, of counsellours. Let us"
19093,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,remember and perpend the words of Paulus Emilius to the people of Rome;
19094,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"that, 'if they judged they could manage the war to more advantage by any"
19095,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"other, he would willingly yield up his charge; but if they confided in"
19096,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"him, _they were not to make themselves his colleagues in his office, or"
19097,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"raise reports, or criticise his actions, but, without talking, supply"
19098,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,him with means and assistance necessary to the carrying on of the war;
19099,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"for, if they proposed to command their own commander, they would render"
19100,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,this expedition more ridiculous than the former.' (Vide Plutarchum in
19101,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Vitâ P.E._) Let us also not forget what the same excellent authour says
19102,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"concerning Perseus's fear of spending money, and not permit the"
19103,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,covetousness of Brother Jonathan to be the good fortune of Jefferson
19104,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Davis. For my own part, till I am ready to admit the Commander-in-Chief"
19105,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"to my pulpit, I shall abstain from planning his battles. If courage be"
19106,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the sword, yet is patience the armour of a nation; and in our desire for"
19107,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"peace, let us never be willing to surrender the Constitution bequeathed"
19108,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,us by fathers at least as wise as ourselves (even with Jefferson Davis
19109,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"to help us), and, with those degenerate Romans, _tuta et præsentia quam"
19110,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,vetera et periculosa malle_.
19111,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19112,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"And not only should we bridle our own tongues, but the pens of others,"
19113,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,which are swift to convey useful intelligence to the enemy. This is no
19114,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"new inconvenience; for, under date, 3d June, 1745, General Pepperell"
19115,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,wrote thus to Governor Shirley from Louisbourg: 'What your Excellency
19116,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"observes of the _army's being made acquainted with any plans proposed,"
19117,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"until ready to be put in execution_, has always been disagreeable to me,"
19118,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and I have given many cautions relating to it. But when your Excellency
19119,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,considers that _our Council of War consists of more than twenty
19120,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"members_, I am persuaded you will think it _impossible for me to hinder"
19121,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"it_, if any of them will persist in communicating to inferior officers"
19122,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and soldiers what ought to be kept secret. I am informed that the Boston
19123,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,newspapers are filled with paragraphs from private letters relating to
19124,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the expedition. Will your Excellency permit me to say I think it may be
19125,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"of ill consequence? Would it not be convenient, if your Excellency"
19126,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"should forbid the Printers' inserting such news?' Verily, if _tempora"
19127,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"mutantur_, we may question the _et nos mutamur in illis;_ and if tongues"
19128,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"be leaky, it will need all hands at the pumps to save the Ship of State."
19129,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Our history dotes and repeats itself. If Sassycus (rather than
19130,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Alcibiades) find a parallel in Beauregard, so Weakwash, as he is called"
19131,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"by the brave Lieutenant Lion Gardiner, need not seek far among our own"
19132,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Sachems for his anti-type.
19133,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19134,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"With respect,"
19135,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Your ob't humble serv't

19780,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"_réveil_. It is true, I have numbered among my parishioners some who are"
19781,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"proof against the prophylactick fennel, nay, whose gift of somnolence"
19782,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"rivalled that of the Cretan Rip Van Winkle, Epimenides, and who,"
19783,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"nevertheless, complained not so much of the substance as of the length"
19784,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of my (by them unheard) discourses. Some ingenious persons of a
19785,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"philosophick turn have assured us that our pulpits were set too high,"
19786,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and that the soporifick tendency increased with the ratio of the angle
19787,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,in which the hearer's eye was constrained to seek the preacher. This
19788,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,were a curious topick for investigation. There can be no doubt that some
19789,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sermons are pitched too high, and I remember many struggles with the"
19790,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"drowsy fiend in my youth. Happy Saint Anthony of Padua, whose finny"
19791,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"acolytes, however they might profit, could never murmur! _Quare"
19792,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"fremuerunt gentes?_ Who is he that can twice a week be inspired, or has"
19793,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"eloquence (_ut ita dicam_) always on tap? A good man, and, next to"
19794,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"David, a sacred poet (himself, haply, not inexpert of evil in this"
19795,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"particular), has said,--"
19796,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19797,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"'The worst speak something good: if all want sense,"
19798,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,God takes a text and preacheth patience.'
19799,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19800,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,There are one or two other points in Mr. Sawin's letter which I would
19801,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"also briefly animadvert upon. And first, concerning the claim he sets up"
19802,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to a certain superiority of blood and lineage in the people of our
19803,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Southern States, now unhappily in rebellion against lawful authority and"
19804,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"their own better interests. There is a sort of opinions, anachronisms at"
19805,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"once and anachorisms, foreign both to the age and the country, that"
19806,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"maintain a feeble and buzzing existence, scarce to be called life, like"
19807,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"winter flies, which in mild weather crawl out from obscure nooks and"
19808,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"crannies to expatiate in the sun, and sometimes acquire vigor enough to"
19809,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,disturb with their enforced familiarity the studious hours of the
19810,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,scholar. One of the most stupid and pertinacious of these is the theory
19811,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,that the Southern States were settled by a class of emigrants from the
19812,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Old World socially superior to those who founded the institutions of New
19813,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,England. The Virginians especially lay claim to this generosity of
19814,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"lineage, which were of no possible account, were it not for the fact"
19815,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,that such superstitions are sometimes not without their effect on the
19816,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,course of human affairs. The early adventurers to Massachusetts at least
19817,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,paid their passages; no felons were ever shipped thither; and though it
19818,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,be true that many deboshed younger brothers of what are called good
19819,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"families may have sought refuge in Virginia, it is equally certain that"
19820,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,a great part of the early deportations thither were the sweepings of the
19821,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,London streets and the leavings of the London stews. It was this my Lord
19822,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Bacon had in mind when he wrote: 'It is a shameful and unblessed thing
19823,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people
19824,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,with whom you plant.' That certain names are found there is nothing to
19825,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the purpose, for, even had an _alias_ been beyond the invention of the"
19826,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"knaves of that generation, it is known that servants were often called"
19827,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"by their masters' names, as slaves are now. On what the heralds call the"
19828,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"spindle side, some, at least, of the oldest Virginian families are"
19829,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,descended from matrons who were exported and sold for so many hogsheads
19830,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"of tobacco the head. So notorious was this, that it became one of the"
19831,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"jokes of contemporary playwrights, not only that men bankrupt in purse"
19832,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and character were 'food for the Plantations' (and this before the
19833,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"settlement of New England), but also that any drab would suffice to wive"
19834,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,such pitiful adventurers. 'Never choose a wife as if you were going to
19835,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Virginia,' says Middleton in one of his comedies. The mule is apt to"
19836,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,forget all but the equine side of his pedigree. How early the
19837,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,counterfeit nobility of the Old Dominion became a topick of ridicule in
19838,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the Mother Country may be learned from a play of Mrs. Behn's, founded on"
19839,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the Rebellion of Bacon: for even these kennels of literature may yield a
19840,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"fact or two to pay the raking. Mrs. Flirt, the keeper of a Virginia"
19841,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ordinary, calls herself the daughter of a baronet, 'undone in the late"
19842,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"rebellion,'--her father having in truth been a tailor,--and three of the"
19843,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Council, assuming to themselves an equal splendor of origin, are shown"
19844,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"to have been, one 'a broken exciseman who came over a poor servant,'"
19845,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"another a tinker transported for theft, and the third 'a common"
19846,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,pickpocket often flogged at the cart's tail.' The ancestry of South
19847,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Carolina will as little pass muster at the Herald's Visitation, though I"
19848,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"hold them to have been more reputable, inasmuch as many of them were"
19849,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"honest tradesmen and artisans, in some measure exiles for conscience'"
19850,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sake, who would have smiled at the high-flying nonsense of their"
19851,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,descendants. Some of the more respectable were Jews. The absurdity of
19852,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,supposing a population of eight millions all sprung from gentle loins in
19853,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the course of a century and a half is too manifest for confutation. But
19854,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of what use to discuss the matter? An expert genealogist will provide
19855,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,any solvent man with a _genus et pro avos_ to order. My Lord Burleigh
19856,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"used to say, with Aristotle and the Emperor Frederick II. to back him,"
19857,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"that 'nobility was ancient riches,' whence also the Spanish were wont to"
19858,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"call their nobles _ricos hombres_, and the aristocracy of America are"
19859,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the descendants of those who first became wealthy, by whatever means."
19860,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Petroleum will in this wise be the source of much good blood among our
19861,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"posterity. The aristocracy of the South, such as it is, has the"
19862,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"shallowest of all foundations, for it is only skin-deep,--the most"
19863,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"odious of all, for, while affecting to despise trade, it traces its"
19864,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"origin to a successful traffick in men, women, and children, and still"
19865,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"draws its chief revenues thence. And though, as Doctor Chamberlayne"
19866,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"consolingly says in his 'Present State of England,' 'to become a"
19867,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Merchant of Foreign Commerce, without serving any Apprentisage, hath"
19868,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"been allowed no disparagement to a Gentleman born, especially to a"
19869,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"younger Brother,' yet I conceive that he would hardly have made a like"
19870,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,exception in favour of the particular trade in question. Oddly enough
19871,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,this trade reverses the ordinary standards of social respectability no
19872,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"less than of morals, for the retail and domestick is as creditable as"
19873,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the wholesale and foreign is degrading to him who follows it. Are our
19874,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"morals, then, no better than _mores_ after all? I do not believe that"
19875,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"such aristocracy as exists at the South (for I hold with Marius,"
19876,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,_fortissimum quemque generosissimum_) will be found an element of
19877,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"anything like persistent strength in war,--thinking the saying of Lord"
19878,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Bacon (whom one quaintly called _inductionis dominus et Verulamii_) as
19879,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"true as it is pithy, that 'the more gentlemen, ever the lower books of"
19880,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"subsidies.' It is odd enough as an historical precedent, that, while the"
19881,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"fathers of New England were laying deep in religion, education, and"
19882,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,freedom the basis of a polity which has substantially outlasted any then
19883,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"existing, the first work of the founders of Virginia, as may be seen in"
19884,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Wingfield's 'Memorial,' was conspiracy and rebellion,--odder yet, as"
19885,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"showing the changes which are wrought by circumstance, that the first"
19886,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"insurrection, in South Carolina was against the aristocratical scheme of"
19887,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the Proprietary Government. I do not find that the cuticular aristocracy
19888,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of the South has added anything to the refinements of civilization
19889,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"except the carrying of bowie-knives and the chewing of tobacco,--a"
19890,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,high-toned Southern gentleman being commonly not only _quadrumanous_ but
19891,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,_quidruminant_.
19892,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19893,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,I confess that the present letter of Mr. Sawin increases my doubts as to
19894,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the sincerity of the convictions which he professes, and I am inclined"
19895,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"to think that the triumph, of the legitimate Government, sure sooner or"
19896,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"later to take place, will find him and a large majority of his newly"
19897,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"adopted fellow-citizens (who hold with Dædalus, the primal"
19898,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sitter-on-the-fence, that _medium tenere tutissimum_) original Union"
19899,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,men. The criticisms towards the close of his letter on certain of our
19900,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"failings are worthy to be seriously perpended; for he is not, as I"
19901,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"think, without a spice of vulgar shrewdness. _Fas est et ab hoste"
19902,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,doceri_: there is no reckoning without your host. As to the good-nature
19903,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"in us which he seems to gird at, while I would not consecrate a chapel,"
19904,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"as they have not scrupled to do in France, to _Notre Dame de la Haine_"
19905,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"(Our Lady of Hate), yet I cannot forget that the corruption of"
19906,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,good-nature is the generation of laxity of principle. Good-nature is our
19907,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"national characteristick; and though it be, perhaps, nothing more than a"
19908,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"culpable weakness or cowardice, when it leads us to put up tamely with"
19909,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,manifold impositions and breaches of implied contracts (as too
19910,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,frequently in our publick conveyances) it becomes a positive crime when
19911,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"it leads us to look unresentfully on peculation, and to regard treason"
19912,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to the best Government that ever existed as something with which a
19913,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,gentleman may shake hands without soiling his fingers. I do not think
19914,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the gallows-tree the most profitable member of our _Sylva;_ but, since"
19915,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"it continues to be planted, I would fain see a Northern limb ingrafted"
19916,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"on it, that it may bear some other fruit than loyal Tennesseeans."
19917,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
19918,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,A relick has recently been discovered on the east bank of Bushy Brook in
19919,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"North Jaalam, which I conceive to be an inscription in Runick characters"

20255,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
20256,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"JAALAM, 10th March, 1862."
20257,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
20258,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"GENTLEMEN,--My leisure has been so entirely occupied with the hitherto"
20259,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,fruitless endeavour to decypher the Runick inscription whose fortunate
20260,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"discovery I mentioned in my last communication, that I have not found"
20261,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"time to discuss, as I had intended, the great problem of what we are to"
20262,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"do with slavery,--a topick on which the publick mind in this place is at"
20263,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,present more than ever agitated. What my wishes and hopes are I need not
20264,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"say, but for safe conclusions I do not conceive that we are yet in"
20265,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,possession of facts enough on which to bottom them with certainty.
20266,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Acknowledging the hand of Providence, as I do, in all events, I am"
20267,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sometimes inclined to think that they are wiser than we, and am willing"
20268,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to wait till we have made this continent once more a place where freemen
20269,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"can live in security and honour, before assuming any further"
20270,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,responsibility. This is the view taken by my neighbour Habakkuk
20271,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Sloansure, Esq., the president of our bank, whose opinion in the"
20272,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"practical affairs of life has great weight with me, as I have generally"

20284,FESTINA LENTE,Once on a time there was a pool
20285,FESTINA LENTE,Fringed all about with flag-leaves cool
20286,FESTINA LENTE,"And spotted with cow-lilies garish,"
20287,FESTINA LENTE,Of frogs and pouts the ancient parish.
20288,FESTINA LENTE,"Alders the creaking redwings sink on,"
20289,FESTINA LENTE,Tussocks that house blithe Bob o' Lincoln
20290,FESTINA LENTE,"Hedged round the unassailed seclusion,"
20291,FESTINA LENTE,Where muskrats piled their cells Carthusian;
20292,FESTINA LENTE,"And many a moss-embroidered log,"
20293,FESTINA LENTE,"The watering-place of summer frog,"
20294,FESTINA LENTE,"Slept and decayed with patient skill,"
20295,FESTINA LENTE,As watering-places sometimes will.
20296,FESTINA LENTE,
20297,FESTINA LENTE,"Now in this Abbey of Theleme,"
20298,FESTINA LENTE,Which realized the fairest dream
20299,FESTINA LENTE,"That ever dozing bull-frog had,"
20300,FESTINA LENTE,"Sunned on a half-sunk lily-pad,"
20301,FESTINA LENTE,There rose a party with a mission
20302,FESTINA LENTE,"To mend the polliwogs' condition,"
20303,FESTINA LENTE,Who notified the selectmen
20304,FESTINA LENTE,To call a meeting there and then.
20305,FESTINA LENTE,"'Some kind of steps,' they said, 'are needed;"
20306,FESTINA LENTE,They don't come on so fast as we did:
20307,FESTINA LENTE,Let's dock their tails; if that don't make 'em
20308,FESTINA LENTE,"Frogs by brevet, the Old One take 'em!"
20309,FESTINA LENTE,"That boy, that came the other day"
20310,FESTINA LENTE,"To dig some flag-root down this way,"
20311,FESTINA LENTE,"His jack-knife left, and 'tis a sign"
20312,FESTINA LENTE,That Heaven approves of our design:
20313,FESTINA LENTE,"'Twere wicked not to urge the step on,"
20314,FESTINA LENTE,When Providence has sent the weapon.'
20315,FESTINA LENTE,
20316,FESTINA LENTE,"Old croakers, deacons of the mire,"
20317,FESTINA LENTE,"That led the deep batrachian choir,"
20318,FESTINA LENTE,_Uk! Uk! Caronk!_ with bass that might
20319,FESTINA LENTE,"Have left Lablache's out of sight,"
20320,FESTINA LENTE,"Shook nobby heads, and said, 'No go!"
20321,FESTINA LENTE,You'd better let 'em try to grow:
20322,FESTINA LENTE,"Old Doctor Time is slow, but still"
20323,FESTINA LENTE,He does know how to make a pill.'
20324,FESTINA LENTE,
20325,FESTINA LENTE,"But vain was all their hoarsest bass,"
20326,FESTINA LENTE,"Their old experience out of place,"
20327,FESTINA LENTE,"And spite of croaking and entreating,"
20328,FESTINA LENTE,The vote was carried in marsh-meeting.
20329,FESTINA LENTE,
20330,FESTINA LENTE,"'Lord knows,' protest the polliwogs,"
20331,FESTINA LENTE,'We're anxious to be grown-up frogs;
20332,FESTINA LENTE,But don't push in to do the work
20333,FESTINA LENTE,Of Nature till she prove a shirk;
20334,FESTINA LENTE,"'Tis not by jumps that she advances,"
20335,FESTINA LENTE,But wins her way by circumstances;
20336,FESTINA LENTE,"Pray, wait awhile, until you know"
20337,FESTINA LENTE,We're so contrived as not to grow;
20338,FESTINA LENTE,"Let Nature take her own direction,"
20339,FESTINA LENTE,And she'll absorb our imperfection;
20340,FESTINA LENTE,"_You_ mightn't like 'em to appear with,"
20341,FESTINA LENTE,But we must have the things to steer with.'
20342,FESTINA LENTE,
20343,FESTINA LENTE,"'No,' piped the party of reform,"
20344,FESTINA LENTE,'All great results are ta'en by storm;

20348,FESTINA LENTE,"And seems to some folks such a mystery,"
20349,FESTINA LENTE,"Does not creep slowly on _incog._,"
20350,FESTINA LENTE,"But moves by jumps, a mighty frog;"
20351,FESTINA LENTE,"No more reject the Age's chrism,"
20352,FESTINA LENTE,Your queues are an anachronism;
20353,FESTINA LENTE,"No more the Future's promise mock,"
20354,FESTINA LENTE,"But lay your tails upon the block,"
20355,FESTINA LENTE,Thankful that we the means have voted
20356,FESTINA LENTE,To have you thus to frogs promoted.'
20357,FESTINA LENTE,
20358,FESTINA LENTE,"The thing was done, the tails were cropped."
20359,FESTINA LENTE,"And home each philotadpole hopped,"
20360,FESTINA LENTE,"In faith rewarded to exult,"
20361,FESTINA LENTE,And wait the beautiful result.
20362,FESTINA LENTE,"Too soon it came; our pool, so long"
20363,FESTINA LENTE,"The theme of patriot bull-frog's song,"
20364,FESTINA LENTE,"Next day was reeking, fit to smother,"
20365,FESTINA LENTE,"With heads and tails that missed each other,--"
20366,FESTINA LENTE,"Here snoutless tails, there tailless snouts;"
20367,FESTINA LENTE,The only gainers were the pouts.

20372,MORAL,"From lower to the higher next,"
20373,MORAL,"Not to the top, is Nature's text;"

20375,MORAL,Absorbs the Evil in its nature.
20376,MORAL,
20377,MORAL,
20378,MORAL,I think that nothing will ever give permanent peace and security to this
20379,MORAL,"continent but the extirpation of Slavery therefrom, and that the"
20380,MORAL,"occasion is nigh; but I would do nothing hastily or vindictively, nor"
20381,MORAL,presume to jog the elbow of Providence. No desperate measures for me
20382,MORAL,"till we are sure that all others are hopeless,--_flectere si nequeo_"
20383,MORAL,"SUPEROS, _Acheronta movebo_. To make Emancipation a reform instead of a"
20384,MORAL,"revolution is worth a little patience, that we may have the Border"
20385,MORAL,"States first, and then the non-slaveholders of the Cotton States, with"
20386,MORAL,"us in principle,--a consummation that seems to be nearer than many"
20387,MORAL,"imagine. _Fiat justitia, ruat coelum_, is not to be taken in a literal"
20388,MORAL,"sense by statesmen, whose problem is to get justice done with as little"
20389,MORAL,"jar as possible to existing order, which has at least so much of heaven"
20390,MORAL,in it that it is not chaos. Our first duty toward our enslaved brother
20391,MORAL,"is to educate him, whether he be white or black. The first need of the"
20392,MORAL,free black is to elevate himself according to the standard of this
20393,MORAL,"material generation. So soon as the Ethiopian goes in his chariot, he"
20394,MORAL,"will find not only Apostles, but Chief Priests and Scribes and Pharisees"
20395,MORAL,willing to ride with him.

20401,MORAL,"Government on the side of freedom, justice, and sound policy."
20402,MORAL,
20403,MORAL,"As I write, comes the news of our disaster at Hampton Roads. I do not"
20404,MORAL,"understand the supineness which, after fair warning, leaves wood to an"
20405,MORAL,unequal conflict with iron. It is not enough merely to have the right on
20406,MORAL,"our side, if we stick to the old flint-lock of tradition. I have"
20407,MORAL,observed in my parochial experience (_haud ignarus mali_) that the Devil
20408,MORAL,"is prompt to adopt the latest inventions of destructive warfare, and may"
20409,MORAL,thus take even such a three-decker as Bishop Butler at an advantage. It
20410,MORAL,"is curious, that, as gunpowder made armour useless on shore, so armour"
20411,MORAL,"is having its revenge by baffling its old enemy at sea; and that, while"
20412,MORAL,gunpowder robbed land warfare of nearly all its picturesqueness to give
20413,MORAL,"even greater stateliness and sublimity to a sea-fight, armour bids fair"
20414,MORAL,to degrade the latter into a squabble between two iron-shelled turtles.

20664,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Pagan historian with his _Facile evenit quod Dis cordi est_,) it seems"
20665,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to me a suitable occasion to withdraw our minds a moment from the
20666,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,confusing din of battle to objects of peaceful and permanent interest.
20667,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Let us not neglect the monuments of preterite history because what shall

20669,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,iterabimus æquor;_ to-morrow will be time enough for that stormy sea;
20670,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,to-day let me engage the attention of your readers with the Runick
20671,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,inscription to whose fortunate discovery I have heretofore alluded. Well
20672,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"may we say with the poet, _Multa renascuntur quæ jam cecidere_. And I"
20673,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"would premise, that, although I can no longer resist the evidence of my"
20674,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,own senses from the stone before me to the ante-Columbian discovery of
20675,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"this continent by the Northmen, _gens inclytissima_, as they are called"
20676,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"in a Palermitan inscription, written fortunately in a less debatable"
20677,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"character than that which I am about to decipher, yet I would by no"
20678,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,means be understood as wishing to vilipend the merits of the great
20679,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Genoese, whose name will never be forgotten so long as the inspiring"
20680,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,strains of 'Hail Columbia' shall continue to be heard. Though he must be
20681,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,stripped also of whatever praise may belong to the experiment of the
20682,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"egg, which I find proverbially attributed by Castilian authors to a"
20683,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"certain Juanito or Jack, (perhaps an offshoot of our giant-killing"
20684,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"mythus,) his name will still remain one of the most illustrious of"
20685,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,modern times. But the impartial historian owes a duty likewise to
20686,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"obscure merit, and my solicitude to render a tardy justice is perhaps"
20687,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"quickened by my having known those who, had their own field of labour"
20688,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"been less secluded, might have found a readier acceptance with the"
20689,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"reading publick, I could give an example, but I forbear: _forsitan"
20690,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,nostris ex ossibus oritur ultor_.
20691,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
20692,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Touching Runick inscriptions, I find that they may lie classed under"
20693,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,three general heads; 1º. Those which are understood by the Danish Royal
20694,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Society of Northern Antiquaries, and Professor Rafn, their Secretary;"
20695,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,2º. Those which are comprehensible only by Mr. Rafn; and 3º. Those
20696,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"which neither the Society, Mr. Rafn, nor anybody else can be said in any"
20697,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"definite sense to understand, and which accordingly offer peculiar"
20698,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,temptations to enucleating sagacity. These last are naturally deemed the
20699,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"most valuable by intelligent antiquaries, and to this class the stone"
20700,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,now in my possession fortunately belongs. Such give a picturesque
20701,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"variety to ancient events, because susceptible oftentimes of as many"
20702,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,interpretations as there are individual archæologists; and since facts
20703,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,are only the pulp in which the Idea or event-seed is softly imbedded
20704,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"till it ripen, it is of little consequence what colour or flavour we"
20705,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"attribute to them, provided it be agreeable. Availing myself of the"
20706,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"obliging assistance of Mr. Arphaxad Bowers, an ingenious photographick"
20707,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"artist, whose house-on-wheels has now stood for three years on our"
20708,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Meeting-House Green, with the somewhat contradictory inscription,--'_our"
20709,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"motto is onward_,'--I have sent accurate copies of my treasure to many"
20710,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"learned men and societies, both native and European. I may hereafter"
20711,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,communicate their different and (_me judice_) equally erroneous
20712,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"solutions. I solicit also, Messrs. Editors, your own acceptance of the"
20713,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"copy herewith enclosed. I need only premise further, that the stone"
20714,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"itself is a goodly block of metamorphick sandstone, and that the Runes"
20715,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,resemble very nearly the ornithichnites or fossil bird-tracks of Dr.
20716,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Hitchcock, but with less regularity or apparent design than is displayed"
20717,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,by those remarkable geological monuments. These are rather the _non bene
20718,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,junctarum discordia semina rerum_. Resolved to leave no door open to
20719,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"cavil, I first of all attempted the elucidation of this remarkable"
20720,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"example of lithick literature by the ordinary modes, but with no"
20721,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,adequate return for my labour. I then considered myself amply justified
20722,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"in resorting to that heroick treatment the felicity of which, as applied"
20723,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"by the great Bentley to Milton, had long ago enlisted my admiration."
20724,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Indeed, I had already made up my mind, that, in case good fortune should"
20725,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"throw any such invaluable record in my way, I would proceed with it in"
20726,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the following simple and satisfactory method. Alter a cursory
20727,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"examination, merely sufficing for an approximative estimate of its"
20728,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"length, I would write down a hypothetical inscription based upon"
20729,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"antecedent probabilities, and then proceed to extract from the"
20730,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,characters engraven on the stone a meaning as nearly as possible
20731,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,conformed to this _a priori_ product of my own ingenuity. The result
20732,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"more than justified my hopes, inasmuch as the two inscriptions were made"
20733,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,without any great violence to tally in all essential particulars. I then
20734,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"proceeded, not without some anxiety, to my second test, which was, to"
20735,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"read the Runick letters diagonally, and again with the same success."
20736,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"With an excitement pardonable under the circumstances, yet tempered with"
20737,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"thankful humility, I now applied my last and severest trial, my"
20738,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"_experimentum crucis_. I turned the stone, now doubly precious in my"
20739,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"eyes, with scrupulous exactness upside down. The physical exertion so"
20740,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,far displaced my spectacles as to derange for a moment the focus of
20741,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,vision. I confess that it was with some tremulousness that I readjusted
20742,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"them upon my nose, and prepared my mind to bear with calmness any"
20743,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"disappointment that might ensue. But, _O albo dies notanda lapillo!_"
20744,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,what was my delight to find that the change of position had effected
20745,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"none in the sense of the writing, even by so much as a single letter! I"
20746,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"was now, and justly, as I think, satisfied of the conscientious"
20747,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,exactness of my interpretation. It is as follows:

21097,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"without challenge in the fervour of oral delivery, cannot always stand"
21098,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the colder criticism of the closet. I am not so great an enemy of

21107,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the results rather of great religious than of merely social convulsions,"
21108,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and do not long survive them. So soon as an earnest conviction has
21109,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"cooled into a phrase, its work is over, and the best that can be done"
21110,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"with it is to bury it. _Ite, missa est_. I am inclined to agree with Mr."

21267,HOMER WILBUR.,I started off to lose me in the hills

21472,PRELIMINARY NOTE,
21473,PRELIMINARY NOTE,[It is with feelings of the liveliest pain that we inform our readers of
21474,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"the death of the Reverend Homer Wilbur, A.M., which took place suddenly,"
21475,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"by an apoplectic stroke, on the afternoon of Christmas day, 1862. Our"
21476,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"venerable friend (for so we may venture to call him, though we never"
21477,PRELIMINARY NOTE,enjoyed the high privilege of his personal acquaintance) was in his
21478,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"eighty-fourth year, having been born June 12, 1779, at Pigsgusset"
21479,PRELIMINARY NOTE,Precinct (now West Jerusha) in the then District of Maine. Graduated
21480,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"with distinction at Hubville College in 1805, he pursued his theological"
21481,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"studies with the late Reverend Preserved Thacker, D.D., and was called"
21482,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"to the charge of the First Society in Jaalam in 1809, where he remained"
21483,PRELIMINARY NOTE,till his death.
21484,PRELIMINARY NOTE,
21485,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"'As an antiquary he has probably left no superior, if, indeed, an"
21486,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"equal,' writes his friend and colleague, the Reverend Jeduthun"
21487,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"Hitchcock, to whom we are indebted for the above facts; 'in proof of"
21488,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"which I need only allude to his ""History of Jaalam, Genealogical,"
21489,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"Topographical, and Ecclesiastical,"" 1849, which has won him an eminent"
21490,PRELIMINARY NOTE,and enduring place in our more solid and useful literature. It is only
21491,PRELIMINARY NOTE,to be regretted that his intense application to historical studies
21492,PRELIMINARY NOTE,should have so entirely withdrawn him from the pursuit of poetical
21493,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"composition, for which he was endowed by Nature with a remarkable"
21494,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"aptitude. His well-known hymn, beginning ""With clouds of care"
21495,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"encompassed round,"" has been attributed in some collections to the late"
21496,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"President Dwight, and it is hardly presumptuous to affirm that the"
21497,PRELIMINARY NOTE,simile of the rainbow in the eighth stanza would do no discredit to that
21498,PRELIMINARY NOTE,polished pen.'
21499,PRELIMINARY NOTE,
21500,PRELIMINARY NOTE,We regret that we have not room at present for the whole of Mr.
21501,PRELIMINARY NOTE,Hitchcock's exceedingly valuable communication. We hope to lay more
21502,PRELIMINARY NOTE,liberal extracts from it before our readers at an early day. A summary
21503,PRELIMINARY NOTE,of its contents will give some notion of its importance and interest. It
21504,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"contains: 1st, A biographical sketch of Mr. Wilbur, with notices of his"
21505,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"predecessors in the pastoral office, and of eminent clerical"
21506,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"contemporaries; 2d, An obituary of deceased, from the Punkin-Falls"
21507,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"'Weekly Parallel;' 3d, A list of his printed and manuscript productions"
21508,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"and of projected works; 4th, Personal anecdotes and recollections, with"
21509,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"specimens of table-talk; 5th, A tribute to his relict, Mrs. Dorcas"
21510,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"(Pilcox) Wilbur; 6th, A list of graduates fitted for different colleges"
21511,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"by Mr. Wilbur, with biographical memoranda touching the more"
21512,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"distinguished; 7th, Concerning learned, charitable, and other"
21513,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"societies, of which Mr. Wilbur was a member, and of those with which,"
21514,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"had his life been prolonged, he would doubtless have been associated,"
21515,PRELIMINARY NOTE,with a complete catalogue of such Americans as have been Fellows of the
21516,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"Royal Society; 8th, A brief summary of Mr. Wilbur's latest conclusions"
21517,PRELIMINARY NOTE,concerning the Tenth Horn of the Beast in its special application to
21518,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"recent events, for which the public, as Mr. Hitchcock assures us, have"
21519,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"been waiting with feelings of lively anticipation; 9th, Mr. Hitchcock's"
21520,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"own views on the same topic; and, 10th, A brief essay on the importance"
21521,PRELIMINARY NOTE,of local histories. It will be apparent that the duty of preparing Mr.
21522,PRELIMINARY NOTE,Wilbur's biography could not have fallen into more sympathetic hands.
21523,PRELIMINARY NOTE,
21524,PRELIMINARY NOTE,In a private letter with which the reverend gentleman has since favored
21525,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"us, he expresses the opinion that Mr. Wilbur's life was shortened by our"
21526,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"unhappy civil war. It disturbed his studies, dislocated all his habitual"
21527,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"associations and trains of thought, and unsettled the foundations of a"
21528,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"faith, rather the result of habit than conviction, in the capacity of"
21529,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"man for self-government. 'Such has been the felicity of my life,' he"
21530,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"said to Mr. Hitchcock, on the very morning of the day he died, 'that,"
21531,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"through the divine mercy, I could always say, _Summum nec metuo diem,"
21532,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"nec opto_. It has been my habit, as you know, on every recurrence of"
21533,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"this blessed anniversary, to read Milton's ""Hymn of the Nativity"" till"
21534,PRELIMINARY NOTE,its sublime harmonies so dilated my soul and quickened its spiritual
21535,PRELIMINARY NOTE,sense that I seemed to hear that other song which gave assurance to the
21536,PRELIMINARY NOTE,shepherds that there was One who would lead them also in green pastures
21537,PRELIMINARY NOTE,and beside the still waters. But to-day I have been unable to think of
21538,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"anything but that mournful text, ""I came not to send peace, but a"
21539,PRELIMINARY NOTE,"sword,"" and, did it not smack of Pagan presumptuousness, could almost"
21540,PRELIMINARY NOTE,wish I had never lived to see this day.'
21541,PRELIMINARY NOTE,

21555,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
21556,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"JAALAM, 24th Dec., 1862."
21557,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
21558,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"RESPECTED SIRS,--- The infirm state of my bodily health would be a"
21559,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"sufficient apology for not taking up the pen at this time, wholesome as"
21560,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,I deem it for the mind to apricate in the shelter of epistolary
21561,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"confidence, were it not that a considerable, I might even say a large,"
21562,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,number of individuals in this parish expect from their pastor some
21563,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"publick expression of sentiment at this crisis. Moreover, _Qui tacitus"
21564,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"ardet magis uritur_. In trying times like these, the besetting sin of"
21565,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,undisciplined minds is to seek refuge from inexplicable realities in the
21566,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,dangerous stimulant of angry partisanship or the indolent narcotick of
21567,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,vague and hopeful vaticination: _fortunamque suo temperat arbitrio_.
21568,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Both by reason of my age and my natural temperament, I am unfitted for"
21569,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"either. Unable to penetrate the inscrutable judgments of God, I am more"
21570,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,than ever thankful that my life has been prolonged till I could in some
21571,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,small measure comprehend His mercy. As there is no man who does not at
21572,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"some time render himself amenable to the one,--_quum vix justus sit"
21573,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"securus_,--so there is none that does not feel himself in daily need of"
21574,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the other.
21575,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
21576,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"I confess I cannot feel, as some do, a personal consolation for the"
21577,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,manifest evils of this war in any remote or contingent advantages that
21578,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"may spring from it. I am old and weak, I can bear little, and can scarce"
21579,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,hope to see better days; nor is it any adequate compensation to know
21580,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,that Nature is young and strong and can bear much. Old men philosophize
21581,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"over the past, but the present is only a burthen and a weariness. The"
21582,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,one lies before them like a placid evening landscape; the other is full
21583,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,of vexations and anxieties of housekeeping. It may be true enough that
21584,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"_miscet hæc illis, prohibetque Clotho fortunam stare_, but he who said"
21585,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,it was fain at last to call in Atropos with her shears before her time;
21586,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and I cannot help selfishly mourning that the fortune of our Republick
21587,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,could not at least stay till my days were numbered.
21588,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
21589,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,Tibullus would find the origin of wars in the great exaggeration of
21590,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"riches, and does not stick to say that in the days of the beechen"
21591,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"trencher there was peace. But averse as I am by nature from all wars,"
21592,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"the more as they have been especially fatal to libraries, I would have"
21593,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"this one go on till we are reduced to wooden platters again, rather than"
21594,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,surrender the principle to defend which it was undertaken. Though I
21595,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"believe Slavery to have been the cause of it, by so thoroughly"
21596,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,demoralizing Northern politicks for its own purposes as to give
21597,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"opportunity and hope to treason, yet I would not have our thought and"
21598,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"purpose diverted from their true object,--the maintenance of the idea of"
21599,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"Government. We are not merely suppressing an enormous riot, but"
21600,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,contending for the possibility of permanent order coexisting with
21601,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,democratical fickleness; and while I would not superstitiously venerate
21602,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"form to the sacrifice of substance, neither would I forget that an"
21603,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,adherence to precedent and prescription can alone give that continuity
21604,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and coherence under a democratical constitution which are inherent in
21605,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,the person of a despotick monarch and the selfishness of an
21606,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,aristocratieal class. _Stet pro ratione voluntas_ is as dangerous in a
21607,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,majority as in a tyrant.
21608,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,
21609,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,I cannot allow the present production of my young friend to go out
21610,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"without a protest from me against a certain extremeness in his views,"
21611,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,more pardonable in the poet than in the philosopher. While I agree with
21612,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"him, that the only cure for rebellion is suppression by force, yet I"
21613,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,must animadvert upon certain phrases where I seem to see a coincidence
21614,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,with a popular fallacy on the subject of compromise. On the one hand
21615,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,there are those who do not see that the vital principle of Government
21616,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,and the seminal principle of Law cannot properly be made a subject of
21617,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"compromise at all, and on the other those who are equally blind to the"
21618,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"truth that without a compromise of individual opinions, interests, and"
21619,TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY,"even rights, no society would be possible. _In medio tutissimus_. For my"

21820,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"[In the month of February, 1866, the editors of the 'Atlantic Monthly'"
21821,PRELIMINARY MOTE,received from the Rev. Mr. Hitchcock of Jaalam a letter enclosing the
21822,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"macaronic verses which follow, and promising to send more, if more"
21823,PRELIMINARY MOTE,should be communicated. 'They were rapped out on the evening of Thursday
21824,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"last past,' he says, 'by what claimed to be the spirit of my late"
21825,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"predecessor in the ministry here, the Rev. Dr. Wilbur, through the"
21826,PRELIMINARY MOTE,medium of a young man at present domiciled in my family. As to the
21827,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"possibility of such spiritual manifestations, or whether they be"
21828,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"properly so entitled, I express no opinion, as there is a division of"
21829,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"sentiment on that subject in the parish, and many persons of the highest"
21830,PRELIMINARY MOTE,respectability in social standing entertain opposing views. The young
21831,PRELIMINARY MOTE,man who was improved as a medium submitted himself to the experiment
21832,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"with manifest reluctance, and is still unprepared to believe in the"
21833,PRELIMINARY MOTE,authenticity of the manifestations. During his residence with me his
21834,PRELIMINARY MOTE,deportment has always been exemplary; he has been constant in his
21835,PRELIMINARY MOTE,attendance upon our family devotions and the public ministrations of the
21836,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"Word, and has more than once privately stated to me, that the latter had"
21837,PRELIMINARY MOTE,often brought him under deep concern of mind. The table is an ordinary
21838,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"quadrupedal one, weighing about thirty pounds, three feet seven inches"
21839,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"and a half in height, four feet square on the top, and of beech or"
21840,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"maple, I am not definitely prepared to say which. It had once belonged"
21841,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"to my respected predecessor, and had been, so far as I can learn upon"
21842,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"careful inquiry, of perfectly regular and correct habits up to the"
21843,PRELIMINARY MOTE,evening in question. On that occasion the young man previously alluded
21844,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"to had been sitting with his hands resting carelessly upon it, while I"
21845,PRELIMINARY MOTE,read over to him at his request certain portions of my last Sabbath's
21846,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"discourse. On a sudden the rappings, as they are called, commenced to"
21847,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"render themselves audible, at first faintly, but in process of time more"
21848,PRELIMINARY MOTE,distinctly and with violent agitation of the table. The young man
21849,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"expressed himself both surprised and pained by the wholly unexpected,"
21850,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"and, so far as he was concerned, unprecedented occurrence. At the"
21851,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"earnest solicitation, however, of several who happened to be present, he"
21852,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"consented to go on with the experiment, and with the assistance of the"
21853,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"alphabet commonly employed in similar emergencies, the following"
21854,PRELIMINARY MOTE,communication was obtained and written down immediately by myself.
21855,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"Whether any, and if so, how much weight should be attached to it, I"
21856,PRELIMINARY MOTE,venture no decision. That Dr. Wilbur had sometimes employed his leisure
21857,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"in Latin versification I have ascertained to be the case, though all"
21858,PRELIMINARY MOTE,that has been discovered of that nature among his papers consists of
21859,PRELIMINARY MOTE,some fragmentary passages of a version into hexameters of portions of
21860,PRELIMINARY MOTE,the Song of Solomon. These I had communicated about a week or ten days
21861,PRELIMINARY MOTE,previous[ly] to the young gentleman who officiated as medium in the
21862,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"communication afterwards received. I have thus, I believe, stated all"
21863,PRELIMINARY MOTE,the material facts that have any elucidative bearing upon this
21864,PRELIMINARY MOTE,mysterious occurrence.'
21865,PRELIMINARY MOTE,
21866,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"So far Mr. Hitchcock, who seems perfectly master of Webster's"
21867,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"unabridged quarto, and whose flowing style leads him into certain"
21868,PRELIMINARY MOTE,farther expatiations for which we have not room. We have since learned
21869,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"that the young man he speaks of was a sophomore, put under his care"
21870,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"during a sentence of rustication from ---- College, where he had"
21871,PRELIMINARY MOTE,distinguished himself rather by physical experiments on the comparative
21872,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"power of resistance in window-glass to various solid substances, than in"
21873,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"the more regular studies of the place. In answer to a letter of inquiry,"
21874,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"the professor of Latin says, 'There was no harm in the boy that I know"
21875,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"of beyond his loving mischief more than Latin, nor can I think of any"
21876,PRELIMINARY MOTE,spirits likely to possess him except those commonly called animal. He
21877,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"was certainly not remarkable for his Latinity, but I see nothing in the"
21878,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"verses you enclose that would lead me to think them beyond his capacity,"
21879,PRELIMINARY MOTE,or the result of any special inspiration whether of beech or maple. Had
21880,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"that of _birch_ been tried upon him earlier and more faithfully, the"
21881,PRELIMINARY MOTE,verses would perhaps have been better in quality and certainly in
21882,PRELIMINARY MOTE,quantity.' This exact and thorough scholar then goes on to point out
21883,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"many false quantities and barbarisms. It is but fair to say, however,"
21884,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"that the author, whoever he was, seems not to have been unaware of some"
21885,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"of them himself, as is shown by a great many notes appended to the"
21886,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"verses as we received them, and purporting to be by Scaliger, Bentley,"
21887,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"and others,--among them the _Esprit de Voltaire_! These we have omitted"
21888,PRELIMINARY MOTE,as clearly meant to be humorous and altogether failing therein.
21889,PRELIMINARY MOTE,
21890,PRELIMINARY MOTE,Though entirely satisfied that the verses are altogether unworthy of Mr.
21891,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"Wilbur, who seems to Slave been a tolerable Latin scholar after the"
21892,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"fashion of his day, yet we have determined to print them here, partly as"
21893,PRELIMINARY MOTE,"belonging to the _res gestæ_ of this collection, and partly as a"
21894,PRELIMINARY MOTE,warning to their putative author which may keep him from such indecorous
21895,PRELIMINARY MOTE,pranks for the future.]

22049,LIBER I,
22050,LIBER I,[The Editors of the 'Atlantic' have received so many letters of inquiry
22051,LIBER I,"concerning the literary remains of the late Mr. Wilbur, mentioned by his"
22052,LIBER I,"colleague and successor, Rev. Jeduthun Hitchcock, in a communication"
22053,LIBER I,"from which we made some extracts in our number for February, 1863, and"
22054,LIBER I,have been so repeatedly urged to print some part of them for the
22055,LIBER I,"gratification of the public, that they felt it their duty at least to"
22056,LIBER I,make some effort to satisfy so urgent a demand. They have accordingly
22057,LIBER I,"carefully examined the papers intrusted to them, but find most of the"
22058,LIBER I,"productions of Mr. Wilbur's pen so fragmentary, and even chaotic,"
22059,LIBER I,written as they are on the backs of letters in an exceedingly cramped
22060,LIBER I,"chirography,--here a memorandum for a sermon; there an observation of"
22061,LIBER I,"the weather; now the measurement of an extraordinary head of cabbage,"
22062,LIBER I,and then of the cerebral capacity of some reverend brother deceased; a
22063,LIBER I,"calm inquiry into the state of modern literature, ending in a method of"
22064,LIBER I,"detecting if milk be impoverished with water, and the amount thereof;"
22065,LIBER I,"one leaf beginning with a genealogy, to be interrupted halfway down with"
22066,LIBER I,"an entry that the brindle cow had calved,--that any attempts at"
22067,LIBER I,"selection seemed desperate. His only complete work, 'An Enquiry"
22068,LIBER I,"concerning the Tenth Horn of the Beast,' even in the abstract of it"
22069,LIBER I,"given by Mr. Hitchcock, would, by a rough computation of the printers,"
22070,LIBER I,"fill five entire numbers of our journal, and as he attempts, by a new"
22071,LIBER I,"application of decimal fractions, to identify it with the Emperor"
22072,LIBER I,"Julian, seems hardly of immediate concern to the general reader. Even"
22073,LIBER I,"the Table-Talk, though doubtless originally highly interesting in the"
22074,LIBER I,"domestic circle, is so largely made up of theological discussion and"
22075,LIBER I,"matters of local or preterite interest, that we have found it hard to"
22076,LIBER I,"extract anything that would at all satisfy expectation. But, in order to"
22077,LIBER I,"silence further inquiry, we subjoin a few passages as illustrations of"
22078,LIBER I,its general character.]
22079,LIBER I,
22080,LIBER I,I think I could go near to be a perfect Christian if I were always a
22081,LIBER I,"visitor, as I have sometimes been, at the house of some hospitable"
22082,LIBER I,friend. I can show a great deal of self-denial where the best of
22083,LIBER I,everything is urged upon me with kindly importunity. It is not so very
22084,LIBER I,hard to turn the other cheek for a kiss. And when I meditate upon the
22085,LIBER I,"pains taken for our entertainment in this life, on the endless variety"
22086,LIBER I,"of seasons, of human character and fortune, on the costliness of the"
22087,LIBER I,"hangings and furniture of our dwelling here, I sometimes feel a singular"
22088,LIBER I,"joy in looking upon myself as God's guest, and cannot but believe that"
22089,LIBER I,"we should all be wiser and happier, because more grateful, if we were"
22090,LIBER I,always mindful of our privilege in this regard. And should we not rate
22091,LIBER I,"more cheaply any honor that men could pay us, if we remembered that"
22092,LIBER I,every day we sat at the table of the Great King? Yet must we not forget
22093,LIBER I,that we are in strictest bonds His servants also; for there is no
22094,LIBER I,impiety so abject as that which expects to be _deadheaded (ut ita
22095,LIBER I,"dicam)_ through life, and which, calling itself trust in Providence, is"
22096,LIBER I,in reality asking Providence to trust us and taking up all our goods on
22097,LIBER I,"false pretences. It is a wise rule to take the world as we find it, not"
22098,LIBER I,always to leave it so.
22099,LIBER I,
22100,LIBER I,It has often set me thinking when I find that I can always pick up
22101,LIBER I,plenty of empty nuts under my shagbark-tree. The squirrels know them by
22102,LIBER I,"their lightness, and I have seldom seen one with the marks of their"
22103,LIBER I,"teeth in it. What a school-house is the world, if our wits would only"
22104,LIBER I,not play truant! For I observe that men set most store by forms and
22105,LIBER I,symbols in proportion as they are mere shells. It is the outside they
22106,LIBER I,"want and not the kernel. What stores of such do not many, who in"
22107,LIBER I,"material things are as shrewd as the squirrels, lay up for the spiritual"
22108,LIBER I,winter-supply of themselves and their children! I have seen churches
22109,LIBER I,"that seemed to me garners of these withered nuts, for it is wonderful"
22110,LIBER I,how prosaic is the apprehension of symbols by the minds of most men. It
22111,LIBER I,"is not one sect nor another, but all, who, like the dog of the fable,"
22112,LIBER I,have let drop the spiritual substance of symbols for their material
22113,LIBER I,"shadow. If one attribute miraculous virtues to mere holy water, that"
22114,LIBER I,"beautiful emblem of inward purification at the door of God's house,"
22115,LIBER I,another cannot comprehend the significance of baptism without being
22116,LIBER I,ducked over head and ears in the liquid vehicle thereof.
22117,LIBER I,
22118,LIBER I,
22119,LIBER I,[Perhaps a word of historical comment may be permitted here. My late
22120,LIBER I,"reverend predecessor was, I would humbly affirm, as free from prejudice"
22121,LIBER I,as falls to the lot of the most highly favored individuals of our
22122,LIBER I,"species. To be sure, I have heard Him say that 'what were called strong"
22123,LIBER I,prejudices were in fact only the repulsion of sensitive organizations
22124,LIBER I,from that moral and even physical effluvium through which some natures
22125,LIBER I,"by providential appointment, like certain unsavory quadrupeds, gave"
22126,LIBER I,warning of their neighborhood. Better ten mistaken suspicions of this
22127,LIBER I,"kind than one close encounter.' This he said somewhat in heat, on being"
22128,LIBER I,questioned as to his motives for always refusing his pulpit to those
22129,LIBER I,itinerant professors of vicarious benevolence who end their discourses
22130,LIBER I,"by taking up a collection. But at another time I remember his saying,"
22131,LIBER I,"'that there was one large thing which small minds always found room for,"
22132,LIBER I,"and that was great prejudices.' This, however, by the way. The statement"
22133,LIBER I,"which I purposed to make was simply this. Down to A.D. 1830, Jaalam had"
22134,LIBER I,"consisted of a single parish, with one house set apart for religions"
22135,LIBER I,services. In that year the foundations of a Baptist Society were laid by
22136,LIBER I,"the labors of Elder Joash Q. Balcom, 2d. As the members of the new body"
22137,LIBER I,"were drawn from the First Parish, Mr. Wilbur was for a time considerably"
22138,LIBER I,exercised in mind. He even went so far as on one occasion to follow the
22139,LIBER I,reprehensible practice of the earlier Puritan divines in choosing a
22140,LIBER I,"punning text, and preached from Hebrews xiii, 9: 'Be not carried about"
22141,LIBER I,"with _divers_ and strange doctrines.' He afterwards, in accordance with"
22142,LIBER I,"one of his own maxims,--'to get a dead injury out of the mind as soon as"
22143,LIBER I,"is decent, bury it, and then ventilate,'--in accordance with this maxim,"
22144,LIBER I,"I say, he lived on very friendly terms with Rev. Shearjashub Scrimgour,"
22145,LIBER I,present pastor of the Baptist Society in Jaalam. Yet I think it was
22146,LIBER I,never unpleasing to him that the church edifice of that society (though
22147,LIBER I,otherwise a creditable specimen of architecture) remained without a
22148,LIBER I,"bell, as indeed it does to this day. So much seemed necessary to do away"
22149,LIBER I,with any appearance of acerbity toward a respectable community of
22150,LIBER I,"professing Christians, which might be suspected in the conclusion of the"
22151,LIBER I,above paragraph.--J.H.]
22152,LIBER I,
22153,LIBER I,
22154,LIBER I,In lighter moods he was not averse from an innocent play upon words.
22155,LIBER I,"Looking up from his newspaper one morning, as I entered his study, he"
22156,LIBER I,"said, 'When I read a debate in Congress, I feel as if I were sitting at"
22157,LIBER I,the feet of Zeno in the shadow of the Portico.' On my expressing a
22158,LIBER I,"natural surprise, he added, smiling, 'Why, at such times the only view"
22159,LIBER I,which honorable members give me of what goes on in the world is through
22160,LIBER I,"their intercalumniations.' I smiled at this after a moment's reflection,"
22161,LIBER I,"and he added gravely, 'The most punctilious refinement of manners is the"
22162,LIBER I,only salt that will keep a democracy from stinking; and what are we to
22163,LIBER I,"expect from the people, if their representatives set them such lessons?"
22164,LIBER I,"Mr. Everett's whole life has been a sermon from this text. There was, at"
22165,LIBER I,"least, this advantage in duelling, that it set a certain limit on the"
22166,LIBER I,"tongue. When Society laid by the rapier, it buckled on the more subtle"
22167,LIBER I,blade of etiquette wherewith to keep obtrusive vulgarity at bay.' In
22168,LIBER I,"this connection, I may be permitted to recall a playful remark of his"
22169,LIBER I,"upon another occasion. The painful divisions in the First Parish, A.D."
22170,LIBER I,"1844, occasioned by the wild notions in respect to the rights of (what"
22171,LIBER I,"Mr. Wilbur, so far as concerned the reasoning faculty, always called)"
22172,LIBER I,"the unfairer part of creation, put forth by Miss Parthenia Almira Fitz,"
22173,LIBER I,are too well known to need more than a passing allusion. It was during
22174,LIBER I,"these heats, long since happily allayed, that Mr. Wilbur remarked that"
22175,LIBER I,'the Church had more trouble in dealing with one _she_resiarch than with
22176,LIBER I,"twenty _he_resiarchs,' and that the men's _conscia recti_, or certainty"
22177,LIBER I,"of being right, was nothing to the women's."
22178,LIBER I,
22179,LIBER I,When I once asked his opinion of a poetical composition on which I had
22180,LIBER I,"expended no little pains, he read it attentively, and then remarked"
22181,LIBER I,"'Unless one's thought pack more neatly in verse than in prose, it is"
22182,LIBER I,wiser to refrain. Commonplace gains nothing by being translated into
22183,LIBER I,"rhyme, for it is something which no hocus-pocus can transubstantiate"
22184,LIBER I,"with the real presence of living thought. You entitle your piece, ""My"
22185,LIBER I,"Mother's Grave,"" and expend four pages of useful paper in detailing your"
22186,LIBER I,"emotions there. But, my dear sir, watering does not improve the quality"
22187,LIBER I,"of ink, even though you should do it with tears. To publish a sorrow to"
22188,LIBER I,"Tom, Dick, and Harry is in some sort to advertise its unreality, for I"
22189,LIBER I,have observed in my intercourse with the afflicted that the deepest
22190,LIBER I,grief instinctively hides its face with its hands and is silent. If your
22191,LIBER I,"piece were printed, I have no doubt it would be popular, for people like"
22192,LIBER I,to fancy that they feel much better than the trouble of feeling. I would
22193,LIBER I,put all poets on oath whether they have striven to say everything they
22194,LIBER I,"possibly could think of, or to leave out all they could not help saying."
22195,LIBER I,"In your own case, my worthy young friend, what you have written is"
22196,LIBER I,"merely a deliberate exercise, the gymnastic of sentiment. For your"
22197,LIBER I,"excellent maternal relative is still alive, and is to take tea with me"
22198,LIBER I,"this evening, D.V. Beware of simulated feeling; it is hypocrisy's first"
22199,LIBER I,cousin; it is especially dangerous to a preacher; for he who says one
22200,LIBER I,"day, ""Go to, let me seem to be pathetic,"" may be nearer than he thinks"
22201,LIBER I,"to saying, ""Go to, let me seem to be virtuous, or earnest, or under"
22202,LIBER I,"sorrow for sin."" Depend upon it, Sappho loved her verses more sincerely"
22203,LIBER I,"than she did Phaon, and Petrarch his sonnets better than Laura, who was"
22204,LIBER I,indeed but his poetical stalking-horse. After you shall have once heard
22205,LIBER I,"that muffled rattle of clods on the coffin-lid of an irreparable loss,"
22206,LIBER I,you will grow acquainted with a pathos that will make all elegies
22207,LIBER I,"hateful. When I was of your age, I also for a time mistook my desire to"
22208,LIBER I,write verses for an authentic call of my nature in that direction. But
22209,LIBER I,"one day as I was going forth for a walk, with my head full of an ""Elegy"
22210,LIBER I,"on the Death of Flirtilla,"" and vainly groping after a rhyme for _lily_"
22211,LIBER I,"that should not be _silly_ or _chilly_, I saw my eldest boy Homer busy"
22212,LIBER I,"over the rain-water hogshead, in that childish experiment at"
22213,LIBER I,"parthenogenesis, the changing a horse-hair into a water-snake. All"
22214,LIBER I,immersion of six weeks showed no change in the obstinate filament. Here
22215,LIBER I,was a stroke of unintended sarcasm. Had I not been doing in my study
22216,LIBER I,precisely what my boy was doing out of doors? Had my thoughts any more
22217,LIBER I,chance of coming to life by being submerged in rhyme than his hair by
22218,LIBER I,soaking in water? I burned my elegy and took a course of Edwards on the
22219,LIBER I,Will. People do not make poetry; it is made out of _them_ by a process
22220,LIBER I,"for which I do not find myself fitted. Nevertheless, the writing of"
22221,LIBER I,"verses is a good rhetorical exercitation, as teaching us what to shun"
22222,LIBER I,most carefully in prose. For prose bewitched is like window-glass with
22223,LIBER I,"bubbles in it, distorting what it should show with pellucid veracity.'"
22224,LIBER I,
22225,LIBER I,
22226,LIBER I,It is unwise to insist on doctrinal points as vital to religion. The
22227,LIBER I,"Bread of Life is wholesome and sufficing in itself, but gulped down with"
22228,LIBER I,"these kickshaws cooked up by theologians, it is apt to produce an"
22229,LIBER I,"indigestion, nay, eyen at last an incurable dyspepsia of scepticism."

22232,LIBER I,One of the most inexcusable weaknesses of Americans is in signing their
22233,LIBER I,"names to what are called credentials. But for my interposition, a person"
22234,LIBER I,who shall be nameless would have taken from this town a recommendation
22235,LIBER I,for an office of trust subscribed by the selectmen and all the voters of
22236,LIBER I,"both parties, ascribing to him as many good qualities as if it had been"
22237,LIBER I,his tombstone. The excuse was that it would be well for the town to be
22238,LIBER I,"rid of him, as it would erelong be obliged to maintain him. I would not"
22239,LIBER I,"refuse my name to modest merit, but I would be as cautious as in signing"
22240,LIBER I,a bond. [I trust I shall be subjected to no imputation of unbecoming
22241,LIBER I,"vanity, if I mention the fact that Mr. W. indorsed my own qualifications"
22242,LIBER I,as teacher of the high-school at Pequash Junction. J.H.] When I see a
22243,LIBER I,"certificate of character with everybody's name to it, I regard it as a"
22244,LIBER I,letter of introduction from the Devil. Never give a man your name unless

22252,LIBER I,"I am often struck, especially in reading Montaigne, with the obviousness"
22253,LIBER I,"and familiarity of a great writer's thoughts, and the freshness they"
22254,LIBER I,"gain because said by him. The truth is, we mix their greatness with all"
22255,LIBER I,they say and give it our best attention. Johannes Faber sic cogitavit
22256,LIBER I,"would be no enticing preface to a book, but an accredited name gives"
22257,LIBER I,credit like the signature to a note of hand. It is the advantage of fame
22258,LIBER I,"that it is always privileged to take the world by the button, and a"

22263,LIBER I,"It is singular how impatient men are with overpraise of others, how"

22265,LIBER I,injury while the other may he their ruin.
22266,LIBER I,
22267,LIBER I,
22268,LIBER I,People are apt to confound mere alertness of mind with attention. The
22269,LIBER I,one is but the flying abroad of all the faculties to the open doors and
22270,LIBER I,windows at every passing rumor; the other is the concentration of every
22271,LIBER I,"one of them in a single focus, as in the alchemist over his alembic at"
22272,LIBER I,the moment of expected projection. Attention is the stuff that memory is
22273,LIBER I,"made of, and memory is accumulated genius."

22282,LIBER I,You suspect a kind of vanity in my genealogical enthusiasm. Perhaps you
22283,LIBER I,are right; but it is a universal foible. Where it does not show itself
22284,LIBER I,"in a personal and private way, it becomes public and gregarious. We"
22285,LIBER I,"flatter ourselves in the Pilgrim Fathers, and the Virginian offshoot of"
22286,LIBER I,a transported convict swells with the fancy ef a cavalier ancestry.
22287,LIBER I,"Pride of birth, I have noticed, takes two forms. One complacently traces"

23244,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"_Heave, ho! Heave, ho!_ he whistles as the twine"
23245,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Slackens its hold; _once more, now!_ and a flash"
23246,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Lightens across the sunlight to the elm
23247,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Where his mate dangles at her cup of felt.
23248,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Nor all his booty is the thread; he trails           80
23249,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"My loosened thought with it along the air,"
23250,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And I must follow, would I ever find"
23251,UNDER THE WILLOWS,The inward rhyme to all this wealth of life.
23252,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23253,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I care not how men trace their ancestry,"
23254,UNDER THE WILLOWS,To ape or Adam: let them please their whim;
23255,UNDER THE WILLOWS,But I in June am midway to believe
23256,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"A tree among my far progenitors,"
23257,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Such sympathy is mine with all the race,"
23258,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Such mutual recognition vaguely sweet
23259,UNDER THE WILLOWS,There is between us. Surely there are times          90
23260,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"When they consent to own me of their kin,"
23261,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And condescend to me, and call me cousin,"
23262,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Murmuring faint lullabies of eldest time,"
23263,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Forgotten, and yet dumbly felt with thrills"
23264,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Moving the lips, though fruitless of all words."
23265,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And I have many a lifelong leafy friend,"
23266,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Never estranged nor careful of my soul,"
23267,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That knows I hate the axe, and welcomes me"
23268,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Within his tent as if I were a bird,"
23269,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Or other free companion of the earth,               100"
23270,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Yet undegenerate to the shifts of men.
23271,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Among them one, an ancient willow, spreads"
23272,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Eight balanced limbs, springing at once all round"
23273,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"His deep-ridged trunk with upward slant diverse,"
23274,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"In outline like enormous beaker, fit"
23275,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"For hand of Jotun, where mid snow and mist"
23276,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"He holds unwieldy revel. This tree, spared,"
23277,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I know not by what grace,--for in the blood"
23278,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Of our New World subduers lingers yet
23279,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Hereditary feud with trees, they being              110"
23280,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"(They and the red-man most) our fathers' foes,--"
23281,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Is one of six, a willow Pleiades,"
23282,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The seventh fallen, that lean along the brink"
23283,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Where the steep upland dips into the marsh,"
23284,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Their roots, like molten metal cooled in flowing,"
23285,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Stiffened in coils and runnels down the bank.
23286,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The friend of all the winds, wide-armed he towers"
23287,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And glints his steely aglets in the sun,"
23288,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Or whitens fitfully with sudden bloom
23289,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of leaves breeze-lifted, much as when a shoal       120"
23290,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Of devious minnows wheel from where a pike
23291,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Lurks balanced 'neath the lily-pads, and whirl"
23292,UNDER THE WILLOWS,A rood of silver bellies to the day.
23293,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Alas! no acorn from the British oak
23294,UNDER THE WILLOWS,'Neath which slim fairies tripping wrought those rings
23295,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of greenest emerald, wherewith fireside life"
23296,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Did with the invisible spirit of Nature wed,"
23297,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Was ever planted here! No darnel fancy
23298,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Might choke one useful blade in Puritan fields;
23299,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With horn and hoof the good old Devil came,         130"
23300,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The witch's broomstick was not contraband,"
23301,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"But all that superstition had of fair,"
23302,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Or piety of native sweet, was doomed."
23303,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And if there be who nurse unholy faiths,"
23304,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Fearing their god as if he were a wolf
23305,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That snuffed round every home and was not seen,"
23306,UNDER THE WILLOWS,There should be some to watch and keep alive
23307,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"All beautiful beliefs. And such was that,--"
23308,UNDER THE WILLOWS,By solitary shepherd first surmised
23309,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Under Thessalian oaks, loved by some maid           140"
23310,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of royal stirp, that silent came and vanished,"
23311,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"As near her nest the hermit thrush, nor dared"
23312,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Confess a mortal name,--that faith which gave"
23313,UNDER THE WILLOWS,A Hamadryed to each tree; and I
23314,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Will hold it true that in this willow dwells
23315,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The open-handed spirit, frank and blithe,"
23316,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of ancient Hospitality, long since,"
23317,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With ceremonious thrift, bowed out of doors."
23318,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23319,UNDER THE WILLOWS,In June 'tis good to lie beneath a tree
23320,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"While the blithe season comforts every sense,       150"
23321,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Steeps all the brain in rest, and heals the heart,"
23322,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Brimming it o'er with sweetness unawares,"
23323,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Fragrant and silent as that rosy snow
23324,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Wherewith the pitying apple-tree fills up
23325,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And tenderly lines some last-year robin's nest.
23326,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"There muse I of old times, old hopes, old friends,--"
23327,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Old friends! The writing of those words has borne
23328,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"My fancy backward to the gracious past,"
23329,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The generous past, when all was possible."
23330,UNDER THE WILLOWS,For all was then untried; the years between        160
23331,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Have taught some sweet, some bitter lessons, none"
23332,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Wiser than this,--to spend in all things else,"
23333,UNDER THE WILLOWS,But of old friends to be most miserly.
23334,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Each year to ancient friendships adds a ring,"
23335,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"As to an oak, and precious more and more,"
23336,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Without deservingness or help of ours,"
23337,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"They grow, and, silent, wider spread, each year,"
23338,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Their unbought ring of shelter or of shade,"
23339,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Sacred to me the lichens on the bark,"
23340,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Which Nature's milliners would scrape away;        170
23341,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Most dear and sacred every withered limb!
23342,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"'Tis good to set them early, for our faith"
23343,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Pines as we age, and, after wrinkles come,"
23344,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Few plant, but water dead ones with vain tears."
23345,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23346,UNDER THE WILLOWS,This willow is as old to me as life;
23347,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And under it full often have I stretched,"
23348,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Feeling the warm earth like a thing alive,"
23349,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And gathering virtue in at every pore
23350,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Till it possessed me wholly, and thought ceased,"
23351,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Or was transfused in something to which thought     180
23352,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Is coarse and dull of sense. Myself was lost.
23353,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Gone from me like an ache, and what remained"
23354,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Become a part of the universal joy.
23355,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"My soul went forth, and, mingling with the tree,"
23356,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Danced in the leaves; or, floating in the cloud,"
23357,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Saw its white double in the stream below;
23358,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Or else, sublimed to purer ecstasy,"
23359,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Dilated in the broad blue over all.
23360,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I was the wind that dappled the lush grass,"
23361,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The tide that crept with coolness to its roots,     190"
23362,UNDER THE WILLOWS,The thin-winged swallow skating on the air;
23363,UNDER THE WILLOWS,The life that gladdened everything was mine.
23364,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Was I then truly all that I beheld?
23365,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Or is this stream of being but a glass
23366,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Where the mind sees its visionary self,"
23367,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"As, when the kingfisher flits o'er his bay,"
23368,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Across the river's hollow heaven below
23369,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"His picture flits,--another, yet the same?"
23370,UNDER THE WILLOWS,But suddenly the sound of human voice
23371,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Or footfall, like the drop a chemist pours,         200"
23372,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Doth in opacous cloud precipitate
23373,UNDER THE WILLOWS,The consciousness that seemed but now dissolved
23374,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Into an essence rarer than its own.
23375,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And I am narrowed to myself once more.
23376,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23377,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"For here not long is solitude secure,"
23378,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Nor Fantasy left vacant to her spell.
23379,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Here, sometimes, in this paradise of shade,"
23380,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Rippled with western winds, the dusty Tramp,"
23381,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Seeing the treeless causey burn beyond,"
23382,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Halts to unroll his bundle of strange food          210
23383,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And munch an unearned meal. I cannot help
23384,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Liking this creature, lavish Summer's bedesman,"
23385,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Who from the almshouse steals when nights grow warm,"
23386,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Himself his large estate and only charge,"
23387,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To be the guest of haystack or of hedge,"
23388,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Nobly superior to the household gear
23389,UNDER THE WILLOWS,That forfeits us our privilege of nature.
23390,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I bait him with my match-box and my pouch,"
23391,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Nor grudge the uncostly sympathy of smoke,"
23392,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"His equal now, divinely unemployed.                 220"
23393,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Some smack of Robin Hood is in the man,"
23394,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Some secret league with wild wood-wandering things;
23395,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"He is our ragged Duke, our barefoot Earl,"
23396,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"By right of birth exonerate from toil,"
23397,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Who levies rent from us his tenants all,"
23398,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And serves the state by merely being. Here
23399,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The Scissors-grinder, pausing, doffs his hat,"
23400,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And lets the kind breeze, with its delicate fan,"
23401,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Winnow the heat from out his dank gray hair,--"
23402,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"A grimy Ulysses, a much-wandered man,               230"
23403,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Whose feet are known to all the populous ways,"
23404,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And many men and manners he hath seen,"
23405,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Not without fruit of solitary thought.
23406,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"He, as the habit is of lonely men,--"
23407,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Unused to try the temper of their mind
23408,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"In fence with others,--positive and shy,"
23409,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Yet knows to put an edge upon his speech,"
23410,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Pithily Saxon in unwilling talk.
23411,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Him I entrap with my long-suffering knife,"
23412,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And, while its poor blade hums away in sparks,      240"
23413,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Sharpen my wit upon his gritty mind,"
23414,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"In motion set obsequious to his wheel,"
23415,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And in its quality not much unlike.
23416,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23417,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Nor wants my tree more punctual visitors.
23418,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The children, they who are the only rich,"
23419,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Creating for the moment, and possessing"
23420,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Whate'er they choose to feign,--for still with them"
23421,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Kind Fancy plays the fairy godmother,"
23422,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Strewing their lives with cheap material
23423,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"For wingèd horses and Aladdin's lamps,              250"
23424,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Pure elfin-gold, by manhood's touch profane"
23425,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To dead leaves disenchanted,--long ago"
23426,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Between the branches of the tree fixed seats,"
23427,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Making an o'erturned box their table. Oft
23428,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The shrilling girls sit here between school hours,"
23429,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And play at _What's my thought like?_ while the boys,"
23430,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With whom the age chivalric ever bides,"
23431,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Pricked on by knightly spur of female eyes,"
23432,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Climb high to swing and shout on perilous boughs,"
23433,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Or, from the willow's armory equipped               260"
23434,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With musket dumb, green banner, edgeless sword,"
23435,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Make good the rampart of their tree-redoubt
23436,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"'Gainst eager British storming from below,"
23437,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And keep alive the tale of Bunker's Hill.
23438,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23439,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Here, too, the men that mend our village ways,"
23440,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Vexing Macadam's ghost with pounded slate,"
23441,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Their nooning take; much noisy talk they spend
23442,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"On horses and their ills; and, as John Bull"
23443,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Tells of Lord This or That, who was his friend,"
23444,UNDER THE WILLOWS,So these make boast of intimacies long              270
23445,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With famous teams, and add large estimates,"
23446,UNDER THE WILLOWS,By competition swelled from mouth to mouth.
23447,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of how much they could draw, till one, ill pleased"
23448,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To have his legend overbid, retorts:"
23449,UNDER THE WILLOWS,'You take and stretch truck-horses in a string
23450,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"From here to Long Wharf end, one thing I know,"
23451,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Not heavy neither, they could never draw,--"
23452,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Ensign's long bow!' Then laughter loud and long.
23453,UNDER THE WILLOWS,So they in their leaf-shadowed microcosm
23454,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Image the larger world; for wheresoe'er             280
23455,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Ten men are gathered, the observant eye"
23456,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Will find mankind in little, as the stars"
23457,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Glide up and set, and all the heavens revolve"
23458,UNDER THE WILLOWS,In the small welkin of a drop of dew.
23459,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23460,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I love to enter pleasure by a postern,"
23461,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Not the broad popular gate that gulps the mob;
23462,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To find my theatres in roadside nooks,"
23463,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Where men are actors, and suspect it not;"
23464,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Where Nature all unconscious works her will,"
23465,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And every passion moves with easy gait,             290"
23466,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Unhampered by the buskin or the train.
23467,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Hating the crowd, where we gregarious men"
23468,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Lead lonely lives, I love society,"
23469,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Nor seldom find the best with simple souls
23470,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Unswerved by culture from their native bent,"
23471,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The ground we meet on being primal man,"
23472,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And nearer the deep bases of our lives.
23473,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23474,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"But oh, half heavenly, earthly half, my soul,"
23475,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Canst thou from those late ecstasies descend,"
23476,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Thy lips still wet with the miraculous wine         300
23477,UNDER THE WILLOWS,That transubstantiates all thy baser stuff
23478,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To such divinity that soul and sense,"
23479,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Once more commingled in their source, are lost,--"
23480,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Canst thou descend to quench a vulgar thirst
23481,UNDER THE WILLOWS,With the mere dregs and rinsings of the world?
23482,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Well, if my nature find her pleasure so,"
23483,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I am content, nor need to blush; I take"
23484,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"My little gift of being clean from God,"
23485,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Not haggling for a better, holding it"
23486,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Good as was ever any in the world,                  310"
23487,UNDER THE WILLOWS,My days as good and full of miracle.
23488,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I pluck my nutriment from any bush,"
23489,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Finding out poison as the first men did
23490,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"By tasting and then suffering, if I must."
23491,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Sometimes my bush burns, and sometimes it is"
23492,UNDER THE WILLOWS,A leafless wilding shivering by the wall;
23493,UNDER THE WILLOWS,But I have known when winter barberries
23494,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Pricked the effeminate palate with surprise
23495,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Of savor whose mere harshness seemed divine.
23496,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23497,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Oh, benediction of the higher mood                  320"
23498,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And human-kindness of the lower! for both
23499,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I will be grateful while I live, nor question"
23500,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"The wisdom that hath made us what we are,"
23501,UNDER THE WILLOWS,With such large range as from the ale-house bench
23502,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Can reach the stars and be with both at home.
23503,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"They tell us we have fallen on prosy days,"
23504,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Condemned to glean the leavings of earth's feast
23505,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Where gods and heroes took delight of old;
23506,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"But though our lives, moving in one dull round"
23507,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of repetition infinite, become                      330"
23508,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Stale as a newspaper once read, and though"
23509,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"History herself, seen in her workshop, seem"
23510,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"To have lost the art that dyed those glorious panes,"
23511,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Rich with memorial shapes of saint and sage,"
23512,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That pave with splendor the Past's dusky aisles,--"
23513,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Panes that enchant the light of common day
23514,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"With colors costly as the blood of kings,"
23515,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Till with ideal hues it edge our thought,--"
23516,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Yet while the world is left, while nature lasts,"
23517,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And man the best of nature, there shall be          340"
23518,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Somewhere contentment for these human hearts,"
23519,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Some freshness, some unused material"
23520,UNDER THE WILLOWS,For wonder and for song. I lose myself
23521,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"In other ways where solemn guide-posts say,"
23522,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"_This way to Knowledge, This way to Repose_,"
23523,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"But here, here only, I am ne'er betrayed,"
23524,UNDER THE WILLOWS,For every by-path leads me to my love.
23525,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23526,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"God's passionless reformers, influences,"
23527,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That purify and heal and are not seen,"
23528,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Shall man say whence your virtue is, or how         350"
23529,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Ye make medicinal the wayside weed?
23530,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"I know that sunshine, through whatever rift,"
23531,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"How shaped it matters not, upon my walls"
23532,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Paints discs as perfect-rounded as its source,"
23533,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And, like its antitype, the ray divine,"
23534,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"However finding entrance, perfect still,"
23535,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Repeats the image unimpaired of God.
23536,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23537,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"We, who by shipwreck only find the shores"
23538,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Of divine wisdom, can but kneel at first;"
23539,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Can but exult to feel beneath our feet,             360"
23540,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That long stretched vainly down the yielding deeps,"
23541,UNDER THE WILLOWS,The shock and sustenance of solid earth;
23542,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Inland afar we see what temples gleam
23543,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Through immemorial stems of sacred groves,"
23544,UNDER THE WILLOWS,And we conjecture shining shapes therein;
23545,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Yet for a space we love to wander here
23546,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Among the shells and seaweed of the beach.
23547,UNDER THE WILLOWS,
23548,UNDER THE WILLOWS,So mused I once within my willow-tent
23549,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"One brave June morning, when the bluff northwest,"
23550,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Thrusting aside a dank and snuffling day           370
23551,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"That made us bitter at our neighbors' sins,"
23552,UNDER THE WILLOWS,Brimmed the great cup of heaven with sparkling cheer
23553,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"And roared a lusty stave; the sliding Charles,"
23554,UNDER THE WILLOWS,"Blue toward the west, and bluer and more blue,"

23573,DARA,
23574,DARA,When Persia's sceptre trembled in a hand
23575,DARA,"Wilted with harem-heats, and all the land"
23576,DARA,Was hovered over by those vulture ills
23577,DARA,"That snuff decaying empire from afar,"
23578,DARA,"Then, with a nature balanced as a star,"
23579,DARA,"Dara arose, a shepherd of the hills."
23580,DARA,
23581,DARA,He who had governed fleecy subjects well
23582,DARA,Made his own village by the selfsame spell
23583,DARA,Secure and quiet as a guarded fold;
23584,DARA,"Then, gathering strength by slow and wise degrees     10"
23585,DARA,"Under his sway, to neighbor villages"
23586,DARA,"Order returned, and faith and justice old."
23587,DARA,
23588,DARA,Now when it fortuned that a king more wise
23589,DARA,"Endued the realm with brain and hands and eyes,"
23590,DARA,He sought on every side men brave and just;
23591,DARA,"And having heard our mountain shepherd's praise,"
23592,DARA,"How he refilled the mould of elder days,"
23593,DARA,To Dara gave a satrapy in trust.
23594,DARA,
23595,DARA,"So Dara shepherded a province wide,"
23596,DARA,Nor in his viceroy's sceptre took more pride         20
23597,DARA,Than in his crook before; but envy finds
23598,DARA,More food in cities than on mountains bare;
23599,DARA,And the frank sun of natures clear and rare
23600,DARA,Breeds poisonous fogs in low and marish minds.
23601,DARA,
23602,DARA,"Soon it was hissed into the royal ear,"
23603,DARA,"That, though wise Dara's province, year by year,"
23604,DARA,"Like a great sponge, sucked wealth and plenty up,"
23605,DARA,"Yet, when he squeezed it at the king's behest,"
23606,DARA,"Some yellow drops, more rich than all the rest,"
23607,DARA,Went to the filling of his private cup.              30
23608,DARA,
23609,DARA,"For proof, they said, that, wheresoe'er he went,"
23610,DARA,"A chest, beneath whose weight the camel bent,"
23611,DARA,Went with him; and no mortal eye had seen
23612,DARA,"What was therein, save only Dara's own;"
23613,DARA,"But, when 'twas opened, all his tent was known"
23614,DARA,To glow and lighten with heaped jewels' sheen.
23615,DARA,
23616,DARA,The King set forth for Dara's province straight;
23617,DARA,"There, as was fit, outside the city's gate,"
23618,DARA,"The viceroy met him with a stately train,"
23619,DARA,"And there, with archers circled, close at hand,      40"
23620,DARA,A camel with the chest was seen to stand:
23621,DARA,"The King's brow reddened, for the guilt was plain."
23622,DARA,
23623,DARA,"'Open me here,' he cried, 'this treasure-chest!'"
23624,DARA,'Twas done; and only a worn shepherd's vest
23625,DARA,Was found therein. Some blushed and hung the head;
23626,DARA,Not Dara; open as the sky's blue roof
23627,DARA,"He stood, and 'O my lord, behold the proof"
23628,DARA,"That I was faithful to my trust,' he said."
23629,DARA,
23630,DARA,"'To govern men, lo all the spell I had!'"
23631,DARA,My soul in these rude vestments ever clad            50
23632,DARA,"Still to the unstained past kept true and leal,"
23633,DARA,"Still on these plains could breathe her mountain air,"
23634,DARA,"And fortune's heaviest gifts serenely bear,"
23635,DARA,Which bend men from their truth and make them reel.
23636,DARA,
23637,DARA,"'For ruling wisely I should have small skill,"
23638,DARA,Were I not lord of simple Dara still;
23639,DARA,"That sceptre kept, I could not lose my way.'"
23640,DARA,"Strange dew in royal eyes grew round and bright,"
23641,DARA,And strained the throbbing lids; before 'twas night
23642,DARA,Two added provinces blest Dara's sway.               60

23646,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL
23647,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23648,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"The snow had begun in the gloaming,"
23649,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,And busily all the night
23650,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Had been heaping field and highway
23651,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,With a silence deep and white.
23652,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23653,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Every pine and fir and hemlock
23654,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Wore ermine too dear for an earl,"
23655,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,And the poorest twig on the elm-tree
23656,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Was ridged inch deep with pearl.
23657,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23658,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,From sheds new-roofed with Carrara
23659,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Came Chanticleer's muffled crow,"
23660,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"The stiff rails softened to swan's-down,"
23661,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,And still fluttered down the snow.
23662,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23663,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,I stood and watched by the window
23664,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"The noiseless work of the sky,"
23665,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"And the sudden flurries of snowbirds,"
23666,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Like brown leaves whirling by.
23667,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23668,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,I thought of a mound in sweet Auburn
23669,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Where a little headstone stood;
23670,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"How the flakes were folding it gently,"
23671,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,As did robins the babes in the wood.
23672,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23673,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Up spoke our own little Mabel,"
23674,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Saying, 'Father, who makes it snow?'"
23675,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,And I told of the good All-father
23676,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Who cares for us here below.
23677,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23678,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Again I looked at the snow-fall,"
23679,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,And thought of the leaden sky
23680,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"That arched o'er our first great sorrow,"
23681,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,When that mound was heaped so high.
23682,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23683,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,I remembered the gradual patience
23684,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"That fell from that cloud like snow,"
23685,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Flake by flake, healing and hiding"
23686,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,The scar that renewed our woe.
23687,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23688,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"And again to the child I whispered,"
23689,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"'The snow that husheth all,"
23690,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Darling, the merciful Father"
23691,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Alone can make it fall!'
23692,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,
23693,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"Then, with eyes that saw not, I kissed her:"
23694,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"And she, kissing back, could not know"
23695,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,"That _my_ kiss was given to her sister,"
23696,THE FIRST SNOW-FALL,Folded close under deepening snow.

23704,I,I
23705,I,
23706,I,'What fairings will ye that I bring?'
23707,I,Said the King to his daughters three;
23708,I,"'For I to Vanity Fair am bound,"
23709,I,Now say what shall they be?'
23710,I,
23711,I,"Then up and spake the eldest daughter,"
23712,I,That lady tall and grand:
23713,I,"'Oh, bring me pearls and diamonds great,"
23714,I,And gold rings for my hand.'
23715,I,
23716,I,"Thereafter spake the second daughter,"
23717,I,That was both white and red:                     10
23718,I,"'For me bring silks that will stand alone,"
23719,I,And a gold comb for my head.'
23720,I,
23721,I,"Then came the turn of the least daughter,"
23722,I,"That was whiter than thistle-down,"
23723,I,And among the gold of her blithesome hair
23724,I,Dim shone the golden crown.
23725,I,
23726,I,"'There came a bird this morning,"
23727,I,"And sang 'neath my bower eaves,"
23728,I,"Till I dreamed, as his music made me,"
23729,I,"""Ask thou for the Singing Leaves.""'              20"
23730,I,
23731,I,Then the brow of the King swelled crimson
23732,I,With a flush of angry scorn:
23733,I,"'Well have ye spoken, my two eldest,"
23734,I,And chosen as ye were born;
23735,I,
23736,I,"'But she, like a thing of peasant race,"
23737,I,That is happy binding the sheaves;'
23738,I,"Then he saw her dead mother in her face,"
23739,I,"And said, 'Thou shalt have thy leaves.'"
23740,I,
23741,I,
23742,II,II
23743,II,
23744,II,He mounted and rode three days and nights
23745,II,"Till he came to Vanity Fair,                      30"
23746,II,"And 'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk,"
23747,II,But no Singing Leaves were there.
23748,II,
23749,II,"Then deep in the greenwood rode he,"
23750,II,"And asked of every tree,"
23751,II,"'Oh, if you have ever a Singing Leaf,"
23752,II,I pray you give it me!'
23753,II,
23754,II,"But the trees all kept their counsel,"
23755,II,"And never a word said they,"
23756,II,Only there sighed from the pine-tops
23757,II,A music of seas far away.                        40
23758,II,
23759,II,Only the pattering aspen
23760,II,"Made a sound of growing rain,"
23761,II,"That fell ever faster and faster,"
23762,II,Then faltered to silence again.
23763,II,
23764,II,"'Oh, where shall I find a little foot-page"
23765,II,"That would win both hose and shoon,"
23766,II,And will bring to me the Singing Leaves
23767,II,If they grow under the moon?'
23768,II,
23769,II,"Then lightly turned him Walter the page,"
23770,II,By the stirrup as he ran:                        50
23771,II,'Now pledge you me the truesome word
23772,II,"Of a king and gentleman,"
23773,II,
23774,II,"'That you will give me the first, first thing"
23775,II,"You meet at your castle-gate,"
23776,II,"And the Princess shall get the Singing Leaves,"
23777,II,Or mine be a traitor's fate.'
23778,II,
23779,II,The King's head dropt upon his breast
23780,II,"A moment, as it might be;"
23781,II,"'Twill be my dog, he thought, and said,"
23782,II,'My faith I plight to thee.'                     60
23783,II,
23784,II,Then Walter took from next his heart
23785,II,"A packet small and thin,"
23786,II,"'Now give you this to the Princess Anne,"
23787,II,The Singing Leaves are therein.'
23788,II,
23789,II,
23790,III,III
23791,III,
23792,III,"As the King rode in at his castle-gate,"
23793,III,"A maiden to meet him ran,"
23794,III,"And 'Welcome, father!' she laughed and cried"
23795,III,"Together, the Princess Anne."
23796,III,
23797,III,"'Lo, here the Singing Leaves,' quoth he,"
23798,III,"'And woe, but they cost me dear!'                70"
23799,III,"She took the packet, and the smile"
23800,III,Deepened down beneath the tear.
23801,III,
23802,III,"It deepened down till it reached her heart,"
23803,III,"And then gushed up again,"
23804,III,And lighted her tears as the sudden sun
23805,III,Transfigures the summer rain.
23806,III,
23807,III,"And the first Leaf, when it was opened,"
23808,III,"Sang: 'I am Walter the page,"
23809,III,And the songs I sing 'neath thy window
23810,III,Are my only heritage.'                           80
23811,III,
23812,III,And the second Leaf sang: 'But in the land
23813,III,"That is neither on earth nor sea,"
23814,III,My lute and I are lords of more
23815,III,Than thrice this kingdom's fee.'
23816,III,
23817,III,"And the third Leaf sang, 'Be mine! Be mine!'"
23818,III,"And ever it sang, 'Be mine!'"
23819,III,"Then sweeter it sang and ever sweeter,"
23820,III,"And said, 'I am thine, thine, thine!'"
23821,III,
23822,III,"At the first Leaf she grew pale enough,"
23823,III,"At the second she turned aside,                  90"
23824,III,"At the third, 'twas as if a lily flushed"
23825,III,With a rose's red heart's tide.
23826,III,
23827,III,"'Good counsel gave the bird,' said she,"
23828,III,"'I have my hope thrice o'er,"
23829,III,"For they sing to my very heart,' she said,"
23830,III,'And it sings to them evermore.'
23831,III,
23832,III,"She brought to him her beauty and truth,"
23833,III,"But and broad earldoms three,"
23834,III,And he made her queen of the broader lands
23835,III,He held of his lute in fee.                     100

24277,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"With bosom half disclosed, and naked arms"
24278,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,More white and undulant than necks of swans;
24279,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And all before her steps an influence ran
24280,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Warm as the whispering South that opens buds
24281,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And swells the laggard sails of Northern May.
24282,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'I am called Pleasure, come with me!' she said,"
24283,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Then laughed, and shook out sunshine from her hair,"
24284,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Nor only that, but, so it seemed, shook out         30"
24285,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"All memory too, and all the moonlit past,"
24286,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Old loves, old aspirations, and old dreams,"
24287,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,More beautiful for being old and gone.
24288,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24289,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,So we two went together; downward sloped
24290,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"The path through yellow meads, or so I dreamed,"
24291,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Yellow with sunshine and young green, but I"
24292,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Saw naught nor heard, shut up in one close joy;"
24293,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"I only felt the hand within my own,"
24294,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Transmuting all my blood to golden fire,"
24295,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Dissolving all my brain in throbbing mist.          40
24296,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24297,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Suddenly shrank the hand; suddenly burst
24298,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"A cry that split the torpor of my brain,"
24299,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And as the first sharp thrust of lightning loosens
24300,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"From the heaped cloud its rain, loosened my sense:"
24301,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'Save me!' it thrilled; 'oh, hide me! there is Death!"
24302,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Death the divider, the unmerciful,"
24303,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"That digs his pitfalls under Love and Youth,"
24304,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And covers Beauty up in the cold ground;
24305,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Horrible Death! bringer of endless dark;
24306,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Let him not see me! hide me in thy breast!'         50
24307,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Thereat I strove to clasp her, but my arms"
24308,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Met only what slipped crumbling down, and fell,"
24309,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"A handful of gray ashes, at my feet."
24310,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24311,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"I would have fled, I would have followed back"
24312,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"That pleasant path we came, but all was changed;"
24313,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Rocky the way, abrupt, and hard to find;"
24314,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Yet I toiled on, and, toiling on, I thought,"
24315,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'That way lies Youth, and Wisdom, and all Good;"
24316,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,For only by unlearning Wisdom comes
24317,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And climbing backward to diviner Youth;              60
24318,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"What the world teaches profits to the world,"
24319,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"What the soul teaches profits to the soul,"
24320,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Which then first stands erect with Godward face,"
24321,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"When she lets fall her pack of withered facts,"
24322,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"The gleanings of the outward eye and ear,"
24323,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And looks and listens with her finer sense;
24324,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Nor Truth nor Knowledge cometh from without.'
24325,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24326,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"After long, weary days I stood again"
24327,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,And waited at the Parting of the Ways;
24328,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Again the figure of a woman veiled                   70
24329,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Stood forth and beckoned, and I followed now:"
24330,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Down to no bower of roses led the path,"
24331,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,But through the streets of towns where chattering Cold
24332,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Hewed wood for fires whose glow was owned and fenced,"
24333,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Where Nakedness wove garments of warm wool
24334,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Not for itself;--or through the fields it led
24335,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Where Hunger reaped the unattainable grain,"
24336,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Where idleness enforced saw idle lands,"
24337,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Leagues of unpeopled soil, the common earth,"
24338,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Walled round with paper against God and Man.        80
24339,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'I cannot look,' I groaned, 'at only these;"
24340,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"The heart grows hardened with perpetual wont,"
24341,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"And palters with a feigned necessity,"
24342,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Bargaining with itself to be content;
24343,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Let me behold thy face.'
24344,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,The Form replied:
24345,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'Men follow Duty, never overtake;"
24346,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Duty nor lifts her veil nor looks behind.'
24347,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"But, as she spake, a loosened lock of hair"
24348,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Slipped from beneath her hood, and I, who looked"
24349,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"To see it gray and thin, saw amplest gold;          90"
24350,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Not that dull metal dug from sordid earth,"
24351,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,But such as the retiring sunset flood
24352,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Leaves heaped on bays and capes of island cloud.
24353,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'O Guide divine,' I prayed, 'although not yet"
24354,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,I may repair the virtue which I feel
24355,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Gone out at touch of untuned things and foul
24356,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"With draughts of Beauty, yet declare how soon!'"
24357,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24358,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"'Faithless and faint of heart,' the voice returned,"
24359,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,'Thou seest no beauty save thou make it first;
24360,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Man, Woman, Nature each is but a glass              100"
24361,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Where the soul sees the image of herself,"
24362,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Visible echoes, offsprings of herself."
24363,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"But, since thou need'st assurance of how soon,"
24364,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Wait till that angel comes who opens all,"
24365,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"The reconciler, he who lifts the veil,"
24366,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"The reuniter, the rest-bringer, Death.'"
24367,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,
24368,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"I waited, and methought he came; but how,"
24369,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Or in what shape, I doubted, for no sign,"
24370,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"By touch or mark, he gave me as he passed;"
24371,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Only I knew a lily that I held                      110
24372,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Snapt short below the head and shrivelled up;
24373,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Then turned my Guide and looked at me unveiled,"
24374,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"And I beheld no face of matron stern,"
24375,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"But that enchantment I had followed erst,"
24376,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"Only more fair, more clear to eye and brain,"
24377,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,Heightened and chastened by a household charm;
24378,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,"She smiled, and 'Which is fairer,' said her eyes,"
24379,THE PARTING OF THE WAYS,'The hag's unreal Florimel or mine?'

24394,ALADDIN,"Since then I have toiled day and night,"

24408,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24409,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Nine years have slipt like hour-glass sand
24410,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"From life's still-emptying globe away,"
24411,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Since last, dear friend, I clasped your hand,"
24412,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"And stood upon the impoverished land,"
24413,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Watching the steamer down the bay.
24414,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24415,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"I held the token which you gave,"
24416,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],While slowly the smoke-pennon curled
24417,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"O'er the vague rim 'tween sky and wave,"
24418,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"And shut the distance like a grave,"
24419,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Leaving me in the colder world;                     10
24420,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24421,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The old, worn world of hurry and heat,"
24422,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The young, fresh world of thought and scope;"
24423,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"While you, where beckoning billows fleet"
24424,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Climb far sky-beaches still and sweet,"
24425,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Sank wavering down the ocean-slope.
24426,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24427,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"You sought the new world in the old,"
24428,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"I found the old world in the new,"
24429,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"All that our human hearts can hold,"
24430,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The inward world of deathless mould,"
24431,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The same that Father Adam knew.                     20

24438,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24439,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Whatever moulds of various brain
24440,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"E'er shaped the world to weal or woe,"

24444,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24445,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Come back our ancient walks to tread,"
24446,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Dear haunts of lost or scattered friends,"
24447,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Old Harvard's scholar-factories red,"
24448,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Where song and smoke and laughter sped
24449,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The nights to proctor-haunted ends.
24450,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24451,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Constant are all our former loves,"
24452,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Unchanged the icehouse-girdled pond,"
24453,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Its hemlock glooms, its shadowy coves,"
24454,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Where floats the coot and never moves,"
24455,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Its slopes of long-tamed green beyond.              40
24456,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24457,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Our old familiars are not laid,"
24458,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Though snapt our wands and sunk our books;
24459,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"They beckon, not to be gainsaid,"
24460,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Where, round broad meads that mowers wade,"
24461,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The Charles his steel-blue sickle crooks.
24462,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24463,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Where, as the cloudbergs eastward blow,"
24464,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],From glow to gloom the hillsides shift
24465,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Their plumps of orchard-trees arow,"
24466,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Their lakes of rye that wave and flow,"
24467,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Their snowy whiteweed's summer drift.               50
24468,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24469,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],There have we watched the West unfurl
24470,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"A cloud Byzantium newly born,"
24471,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"With flickering spires and domes of pearl,"
24472,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],And vapory surfs that crowd and curl
24473,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Into the sunset's Golden Horn.
24474,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24475,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"There, as the flaming occident"
24476,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Burned slowly down to ashes gray,"
24477,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Night pitched o'erhead her silent tent,"
24478,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],And glimmering gold from Hesper sprent
24479,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Upon the darkened river lay,                        60"
24480,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24481,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Where a twin sky but just before
24482,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Deepened, and double swallows skimmed,"
24483,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],And from a visionary shore
24484,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Hung visioned trees, that more and more"
24485,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Grew dusk as those above were dimmed.
24486,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24487,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Then eastward saw we slowly grow
24488,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Clear-edged the lines of roof and spire,"
24489,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"While great elm-masses blacken slow,"
24490,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],And linden-ricks their round heads show
24491,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Against a flush of widening fire.                   70
24492,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24493,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Doubtful at first and far away,"
24494,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The moon-flood creeps more wide and wide;
24495,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Up a ridged beach of cloudy gray,"
24496,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Curved round the east as round a bay,"
24497,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],It slips and spreads its gradual tide.
24498,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24499,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Then suddenly, in lurid mood,"
24500,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The disk looms large o'er town and field
24501,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"As upon Adam, red like blood,"
24502,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"'Tween him and Eden's happy wood,"
24503,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Glared the commissioned angel's shield.             80

24505,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Or let us seek the seaside, there"
24506,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"To wander idly as we list,"
24507,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Whether, on rocky headlands bare,"
24508,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Sharp cedar-horns, like breakers, tear"
24509,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The trailing fringes of gray mist,"
24510,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24511,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Or whether, under skies full flown,"
24512,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The brightening surfs, with foamy din,"
24513,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Their breeze-caught forelocks backward blown,"
24514,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Against the beach's yellow zone
24515,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Curl slow, and plunge forever in.                   90"
24516,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24517,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"And, as we watch those canvas towers"

24531,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"But here, far better understood,"
24532,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"The days enforce our native mood,"
24533,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],And challenge all our manlier powers.
24534,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24535,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Kindlier to me the place of birth

24539,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The virtue in the native sod.                     110
24540,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24541,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Thence climbs an influence more benign
24542,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Through pulse and nerve, through heart and brain;"
24543,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],Sacred to me those fibres fine
24544,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"That first clasped earth. Oh, ne'er be mine"
24545,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],The alien sun and alien rain!
24546,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],
24547,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],These nourish not like homelier glows
24548,TO J[OHN] F[RANCIS] H[EATH],"Or waterings of familiar skies,"

24563,THE NOMADES,What Nature makes in any mood
24564,THE NOMADES,"To me is warranted for good,"
24565,THE NOMADES,Though long before I learned to see
24566,THE NOMADES,"She did not set us moral theses,"
24567,THE NOMADES,And scorned to have her sweet caprices
24568,THE NOMADES,Strait-waistcoated in you or me.
24569,THE NOMADES,
24570,THE NOMADES,"I, who take root and firmly cling,"
24571,THE NOMADES,Thought fixedness the only thing;
24572,THE NOMADES,"Why Nature made the butterflies,"

24574,THE NOMADES,"At noon the slumberous poppies over,)"

24577,THE NOMADES,"Till once, upon a rock's brown bosom,"
24578,THE NOMADES,"Bright as a thorny cactus-blossom,"
24579,THE NOMADES,I saw a butterfly at rest;
24580,THE NOMADES,Then first of both I felt the beauty;
24581,THE NOMADES,"The airy whim, the grim-set duty,"
24582,THE NOMADES,Each from the other took its best.
24583,THE NOMADES,
24584,THE NOMADES,Clearer it grew than winter sky
24585,THE NOMADES,That Nature still had reasons why;                 20
24586,THE NOMADES,"And, shifting sudden as a breeze,"
24587,THE NOMADES,"My fancy found no satisfaction,"
24588,THE NOMADES,"No antithetic sweet attraction,"
24589,THE NOMADES,So great as in the Nomades.

24591,THE NOMADES,"Scythians, with Nature not at strife,"

24594,THE NOMADES,"To utilize Time's sliding river,"

24600,THE NOMADES,"Beneath the palm-trees, on the grass,"
24601,THE NOMADES,"They sing, they dance, make love, and chatter,"
24602,THE NOMADES,"Vex the grim temples with their clatter,"
24603,THE NOMADES,And make Truth's fount their looking-glass.
24604,THE NOMADES,
24605,THE NOMADES,"A picnic life; from love to love,"
24606,THE NOMADES,"From faith to faith they lightly move,"
24607,THE NOMADES,"And yet, hard-eyed philosopher,"
24608,THE NOMADES,The flightiest maid that ever hovered              40
24609,THE NOMADES,"To me your thought-webs fine discovered,"
24610,THE NOMADES,No lens to see them through like her.
24611,THE NOMADES,
24612,THE NOMADES,So witchingly her finger-tips
24613,THE NOMADES,"To Wisdom, as away she trips,"
24614,THE NOMADES,"She kisses, waves such sweet farewells"
24615,THE NOMADES,"To Duty, as she laughs 'To-morrow!'"
24616,THE NOMADES,That both from that mad contrast borrow
24617,THE NOMADES,A perfectness found nowhere else.
24618,THE NOMADES,
24619,THE NOMADES,The beach-bird on its pearly verge
24620,THE NOMADES,"Follows and flies the whispering surge,            50"
24621,THE NOMADES,"While, in his tent, the rock-stayed shell"
24622,THE NOMADES,"Awaits the flood's star-timed vibrations,"
24623,THE NOMADES,"And both, the flutter and the patience,"
24624,THE NOMADES,The sauntering poet loves them well.
24625,THE NOMADES,
24626,THE NOMADES,Fulfil so much of God's decree
24627,THE NOMADES,"As works its problem out in thee,"
24628,THE NOMADES,Nor dream that in thy breast alone
24629,THE NOMADES,"The conscience of the changeful seasons,"

24636,THE NOMADES,"Nature of sameness is so chary,"

24684,I,
24685,I,A heap of bare and splintery crags
24686,I,"Tumbled about by lightning and frost,"
24687,I,"With rifts and chasms and storm-bleached jags,"
24688,I,That wait and growl for a ship to be lost;
24689,I,"No island, but rather the skeleton"
24690,I,"Of a wrecked and vengeance-smitten one,"
24691,I,"Where, æons ago, with half-shut eye,"
24692,I,"The sluggish saurian crawled to die,"
24693,I,Gasping under titanic ferns;
24694,I,"Ribs of rock that seaward jut,                      10"
24695,I,"Granite shoulders and boulders and snags,"
24696,I,"Round which, though the winds in heaven be shut,"
24697,I,"The nightmared ocean murmurs and yearns,"
24698,I,"Welters, and swashes, and tosses, and turns,"
24699,I,And the dreary black seaweed lolls and wags;
24700,I,"Only rock from shore to shore,"
24701,I,"Only a moan through the bleak clefts blown,"
24702,I,"With sobs in the rifts where the coarse kelp shifts,"
24703,I,"Falling and lifting, tossing and drifting,"
24704,I,"And under all a deep, dull roar,                     20"
24705,I,"Dying and swelling, forevermore,--"
24706,I,"Rock and moan and roar alone,"
24707,I,"And the dread of some nameless thing unknown,"
24708,I,These make Appledore.
24709,I,
24710,I,These make Appledore by night:
24711,I,Then there are monsters left and right;
24712,I,Every rock is a different monster;
24713,I,"All you have read of, fancied, dreamed,"
24714,I,"When you waked at night because you screamed,"
24715,I,"There they lie for half a mile,                     30"
24716,I,"Jumbled together in a pile,"
24717,I,And (though you know they never once stir)
24718,I,"If you look long, they seem to be moving"
24719,I,"Just as plainly as plain can be,"
24720,I,"Crushing and crowding, wading and shoving"
24721,I,"Out into the awful sea,"
24722,I,Where you can hear them snort and spout
24723,I,"With pauses between, as if they were listening,"
24724,I,Then tumult anon when the surf breaks glistening
24725,I,In the blackness where they wallow about.           40

24729,II,
24730,II,"All this you would scarcely comprehend,"
24731,II,Should you see the isle on a sunny day;
24732,II,"Then it is simple enough in its way,--"
24733,II,"Two rocky bulges, one at each end,"
24734,II,With a smaller bulge and a hollow between;
24735,II,Patches of whortleberry and bay;
24736,II,"Accidents of open green,"
24737,II,"Sprinkled with loose slabs square and gray,"
24738,II,Like graveyards for ages deserted; a few
24739,II,"Unsocial thistles; an elder or two,                 50"
24740,II,Foamed over with blossoms white as spray;
24741,II,And on the whole island never a tree
24742,II,"Save a score of sumachs, high as your knee."
24743,II,"That crouch in hollows where they may,"
24744,II,"(The cellars where once stood a village, men say,)"
24745,II,"Huddling for warmth, and never grew"
24746,II,Tall enough for a peep at the sea;
24747,II,A general dazzle of open blue;
24748,II,A breeze always blowing and playing rat-tat
24749,II,With the bow of the ribbon round your hat;          60
24750,II,A score of sheep that do nothing but stare
24751,II,Up or down at you everywhere;
24752,II,Three or four cattle that chew the cud
24753,II,Lying about in a listless despair;
24754,II,A medrick that makes you look overhead
24755,II,"With short, sharp scream, as he sights his prey,"
24756,II,"And, dropping straight and swift as lead,"
24757,II,Splits the water with sudden thud;--
24758,II,This is Appledore by day.
24759,II,
24760,II,"A common island, you will say;                      70"
24761,II,But stay a moment: only climb
24762,II,"Up to the highest rock of the isle,"
24763,II,"Stand there alone for a little while,"
24764,II,"And with gentle approaches it grows sublime,"
24765,II,Dilating slowly as you win
24766,II,A sense from the silence to take it in.
24767,II,"So wide the loneness, so lucid the air,"
24768,II,"The granite beneath you so savagely bare,"
24769,II,You well might think you were looking down
24770,II,"From some sky-silenced mountain's crown,            80"
24771,II,Whose waist-belt of pines is wont to tear
24772,II,Locks of wool from the topmost cloud.
24773,II,"Only be sure you go alone,"
24774,II,"For Grandeur is inaccessibly proud,"
24775,II,And never yet has backward thrown
24776,II,Her veil to feed the stare of a crowd;
24777,II,To more than one was never shown
24778,II,"That awful front, nor is it fit"
24779,II,"That she, Cothurnus-shod, stand bowed"
24780,II,Until the self-approving pit                        90
24781,II,Enjoy the gust of its own wit
24782,II,In babbling plaudits cheaply loud;
24783,II,She hides her mountains and her sea
24784,II,"From the harriers of scenery,"
24785,II,"Who hunt down sunsets, and huddle and bay,"
24786,II,Mouthing and mumbling the dying day.
24787,II,
24788,II,"Trust me, 'tis something to be cast"
24789,II,"Face to face with one's Self at last,"
24790,II,"To be taken out of the fuss and strife,"
24791,II,"The endless clatter of plate and knife,            100"
24792,II,"The bore of books and the bores of the street,"
24793,II,"From the singular mess we agree to call Life,"
24794,II,"Where that is best which the most fools vote is,"
24795,II,And planted firm on one's own two feet
24796,II,"So nigh to the great warm heart of God,"
24797,II,You almost seem to feel it beat
24798,II,Down from the sunshine and up from the sod;
24799,II,"To be compelled, as it were, to notice"
24800,II,All the beautiful changes and chances
24801,II,"Through which the landscape flits and glances,      110"
24802,II,And to see how the face of common day
24803,II,"Is written all over with tender histories,"
24804,II,When you study it that intenser way
24805,II,In which a lover looks at his mistress.
24806,II,
24807,II,Till now you dreamed not what could be done
24808,II,With a bit of rock and a ray of sun:
24809,II,"But look, how fade the lights and shades"
24810,II,Of keen bare edge and crevice deep!
24811,II,"How doubtfully it fades and fades,"
24812,II,"And glows again, yon craggy steep,                 120"
24813,II,"O'er which, through color's dreamiest grades,"
24814,II,The musing sunbeams pause and creep!
24815,II,"Now pink it blooms, now glimmers gray,"
24816,II,"Now shadows to a filmy blue,"
24817,II,"Tries one, tries all, and will not stay,"
24818,II,"But flits from opal hue to hue,"
24819,II,And runs through every tenderest range
24820,II,"Of change that seems not to be change,"
24821,II,"So rare the sweep, so nice the art,"
24822,II,"That lays no stress on any part,                   130"
24823,II,But shifts and lingers and persuades;
24824,II,"So soft that sun-brush in the west,"
24825,II,"That asks no costlier pigments' aids,"
24826,II,"But mingling knobs, flaws, angles, dints,"
24827,II,"Indifferent of worst or best,"
24828,II,Enchants the cliffs with wraiths and hints
24829,II,"And gracious preludings of tints,"
24830,II,"Where all seems fixed, yet all evades,"
24831,II,And indefinably pervades
24832,II,Perpetual movement with perpetual rest!            140
24833,II,
24834,II,
24835,III,III
24836,III,
24837,III,Away northeast is Boone Island light;
24838,III,"You might mistake it for a ship,"
24839,III,"Only it stands too plumb upright,"
24840,III,And like the others does not slip
24841,III,Behind the sea's unsteady brink;
24842,III,"Though, if a cloud-shade chance to dip"
24843,III,"Upon it a moment, 'twill suddenly sink,"
24844,III,"Levelled and lost in the darkened main,"
24845,III,"Till the sun builds it suddenly up again,"
24846,III,As if with a rub of Aladdin's lamp.                150
24847,III,On the mainland you see a misty camp
24848,III,Of mountains pitched tumultuously:
24849,III,That one looming so long and large
24850,III,"Is Saddleback, and that point you see"
24851,III,"Over yon low and rounded marge,"
24852,III,Like the boss of a sleeping giant's targe
24853,III,"Laid over his breast, is Ossipee;"
24854,III,That shadow there may be Kearsarge;
24855,III,"That must be Great Haystack; I love these names,"
24856,III,Wherewith the lonely farmer tames                   160
24857,III,Nature to mute companionship
24858,III,"With his own mind's domestic mood,"
24859,III,And strives the surly world to clip
24860,III,In the arms of familiar habitude.
24861,III,'Tis well he could not contrive to make
24862,III,A Saxon of Agamenticus:
24863,III,"He glowers there to the north of us,"
24864,III,"Wrapt in his blanket of blue haze,"
24865,III,"Unconvertibly savage, and scorns to take"
24866,III,The white man's baptism or his ways.                170
24867,III,Him first on shore the coaster divines
24868,III,"Through the early gray, and sees him shake"
24869,III,The morning mist from his scalp-lock of pines;
24870,III,"Him first the skipper makes out in the west,"
24871,III,"Ere the earliest sunstreak shoots tremulous,"
24872,III,Plashing with orange the palpitant lines
24873,III,"Of mutable billow, crest after crest,"
24874,III,And murmurs _Agamenticus!_
24875,III,As if it were the name of a saint.
24876,III,"But is that a mountain playing cloud,               180"
24877,III,"Or a cloud playing mountain, just there, so faint?"
24878,III,Look along over the low right shoulder
24879,III,Of Agamenticus into that crowd
24880,III,Of brassy thunderheads behind it;
24881,III,"Now you have caught it, but, ere you are older"
24882,III,"By half an hour, you will lose it and find it"
24883,III,"A score of times; while you look 'tis gone,"
24884,III,"And, just as you've given it up, anon"
24885,III,"It is there again, till your weary eyes"
24886,III,"Fancy they see it waver and rise,                   190"
24887,III,"With its brother clouds; it is Agiochook,"
24888,III,"There if you seek not, and gone if you look,"
24889,III,Ninety miles off as the eagle flies.
24890,III,
24891,III,But mountains make not all the shore
24892,III,The mainland shows to Appledore:
24893,III,Eight miles the heaving water spreads
24894,III,"To a long, low coast with beaches and heads"
24895,III,"That run through unimagined mazes,"
24896,III,As the lights and shades and magical hazes
24897,III,"Put them away or bring them near,                   200"
24898,III,"Shimmering, sketched out for thirty miles"
24899,III,"Between two capes that waver like threads,"
24900,III,"And sink in the ocean, and reappear,"
24901,III,Crumbled and melted to little isles
24902,III,"With filmy trees, that seem the mere"
24903,III,Half-fancies of drowsy atmosphere;
24904,III,"And see the beach there, where it is"
24905,III,"Flat as a threshing-floor, beaten and packed"
24906,III,"With the flashing flails of weariless seas,"
24907,III,"How it lifts and looms to a precipice,             210"
24908,III,"O'er whose square front, a dream, no more,"
24909,III,"The steepened sand-stripes seem to pour,"
24910,III,A murmurless vision of cataract;
24911,III,"You almost fancy you hear a roar,"
24912,III,Fitful and faint from the distance wandering;
24913,III,"But 'tis only the blind old ocean maundering,"
24914,III,"Raking the shingle to and fro,"
24915,III,Aimlessly clutching and letting go
24916,III,"The kelp-haired sedges of Appledore,"
24917,III,"Slipping down with a sleepy forgetting,            220"
24918,III,"And anon his ponderous shoulder setting,"
24919,III,"With a deep, hoarse pant against Appledore."
24920,III,
24921,III,
24922,IV,IV
24923,IV,
24924,IV,"Eastward as far as the eye can see,"
24925,IV,"Still eastward, eastward, endlessly,"
24926,IV,The sparkle and tremor of purple sea
24927,IV,"That rises before you, a flickering hill,"
24928,IV,"On and on to the shut of the sky,"
24929,IV,"And beyond, you fancy it sloping until"
24930,IV,The same multitudinous throb and thrill

24932,IV,In ripples of orange and pink are sent
24933,IV,"Where the poppied sails doze on the yard,"
24934,IV,And the clumsy junk and proa lie
24935,IV,"Sunk deep with precious woods and nard,"
24936,IV,'Mid the palmy isles of the Orient.
24937,IV,Those leaning towers of clouded white
24938,IV,"On the farthest brink of doubtful ocean,"
24939,IV,"That shorten and shorten out of sight,"
24940,IV,"Yet seem on the selfsame spot to stay,"
24941,IV,"Receding with a motionless motion,                 240"
24942,IV,"Fading to dubious films of gray,"
24943,IV,"Lost, dimly found, then vanished wholly,"
24944,IV,"Will rise again, the great world under,"
24945,IV,"First films, then towers, then high-heaped clouds,"
24946,IV,Whose nearing outlines sharpen slowly
24947,IV,"Into tall ships with cobweb shrouds,"
24948,IV,"That fill long Mongol eyes with wonder,"
24949,IV,Crushing the violet wave to spray
24950,IV,Past some low headland of Cathay;--
24951,IV,"What was that sigh which seemed so near,           250"
24952,IV,Chilling your fancy to the core?
24953,IV,"'Tis only the sad old sea you hear,"
24954,IV,That seems to seek forevermore
24955,IV,"Something it cannot find, and so,"
24956,IV,"Sighing, seeks on, and tells its woe"
24957,IV,To the pitiless breakers of Appledore.

24961,V,
24962,V,How looks Appledore in a storm?
24963,V,"I have seen it when its crags seemed frantic,"
24964,V,"Butting against the mad Atlantic,"
24965,V,"When surge on surge would heap enorme,              260"
24966,V,"Cliffs of emerald topped with snow,"
24967,V,"That lifted and lifted, and then let go"
24968,V,"A great white avalanche of thunder,"
24969,V,"A grinding, blinding, deafening ire"
24970,V,Monadnock might have trembled under;
24971,V,"And the island, whose rock-roots pierce below"
24972,V,"To where they are warmed with the central fire,"
24973,V,"You could feel its granite fibres racked,"
24974,V,As it seemed to plunge with a shudder and thrill
24975,V,"Right at the breast of the swooping hill,         270"
24976,V,And to rise again snorting a cataract
24977,V,"Of rage-froth from every cranny and ledge,"
24978,V,"While the sea drew its breath in hoarse and deep,"
24979,V,"And the next vast breaker curled its edge,"
24980,V,Gathering itself for a mightier leap.
24981,V,
24982,V,"North, east, and south there are reefs and breakers"
24983,V,"You would never dream of in smooth weather,"
24984,V,"That toss and gore the sea for acres,"
24985,V,Bellowing and gnashing and snarling together;
24986,V,"Look northward, where Duck Island lies,             280"
24987,V,"And over its crown you will see arise,"
24988,V,"Against a background of slaty skies,"
24989,V,"A row of pillars still and white,"
24990,V,"That glimmer, and then are gone from sight,"
24991,V,"As if the moon should suddenly kiss,"
24992,V,"While you crossed the gusty desert by night,"
24993,V,The long colonnades of Persepolis;
24994,V,"Look southward for White Island light,"
24995,V,The lantern stands ninety feet o'er the tide;
24996,V,"There is first a half-mile of tumult and fight,     290"
24997,V,"Of dash and roar and tumble and fright,"
24998,V,"And surging bewilderment wild and wide,"
24999,V,"Where the breakers struggle left and right,"
25000,V,"Then a mile or more of rushing sea,"
25001,V,And then the lighthouse slim and lone;
25002,V,And whenever the weight of ocean is thrown
25003,V,"Full and fair on White Island head,"
25004,V,A great mist-jotun you will see
25005,V,Lifting himself up silently
25006,V,"High and huge o'er the lighthouse top,              300"
25007,V,"With hands of wavering spray outspread,"
25008,V,"Groping after the little tower,"
25009,V,"That seems to shrink and shorten and cower,"
25010,V,"Till the monster's arms of a sudden drop,"
25011,V,And silently and fruitlessly
25012,V,He sinks back into the sea.
25013,V,
25014,V,"You, meanwhile, where drenched you stand,"
25015,V,"Awaken once more to the rush and roar,"
25016,V,"And on the rock-point tighten your hand,"
25017,V,"As you turn and see a valley deep,                  310"
25018,V,"That was not there a moment before,"
25019,V,Suck rattling down between you and a heap
25020,V,"Of toppling billow, whose instant fall"
25021,V,"Must sink the whole island once for all,"
25022,V,"Or watch the silenter, stealthier seas"
25023,V,Feeling their way to you more and more;
25024,V,"If they once should clutch you high as the knees,"
25025,V,"They would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp,"
25026,V,Beyond all reach of hope or help;--
25027,V,And such in a storm is Appledore.                320

25033,VI,"The great shorn sun as you see it now,"
25034,VI,Across eight miles of undulant gold
25035,VI,"That widens landward, weltered and rolled,"
25036,VI,With freaks of shadow and crimson stains;
25037,VI,To see the solid mountain brow
25038,VI,"As it notches the disk, and gains and gains,"
25039,VI,"Until there comes, you scarce know when,"
25040,VI,A tremble of fire o'er the parted lips
25041,VI,"Of cloud and mountain, which vanishes; then        330"
25042,VI,From the body of day the sun-soul slips
25043,VI,And the face of earth darkens; but now the strips
25044,VI,"Of western vapor, straight and thin,"
25045,VI,From which the horizon's swervings win
25046,VI,"A grace of contrast, take fire and burn"
25047,VI,"Like splinters of touchwood, whose edges a mould"
25048,VI,Of ashes o'er feathers; northward turn
25049,VI,"For an instant, and let your eye grow cold"
25050,VI,"On Agamenticus, and when once more"
25051,VI,"You look, 'tis as if the land-breeze, growing,      340"
25052,VI,"From the smouldering brands the film were blowing,"
25053,VI,And brightening them down to the very core;
25054,VI,"Yet, they momently cool and dampen and deaden,"
25055,VI,"The crimson turns golden, the gold turns leaden,"
25056,VI,Hardening into one black bar
25057,VI,"O'er which, from the hollow heaven afar,"
25058,VI,"Shoots a splinter of light like diamond,"
25059,VI,"Half seen, half fancied; by and by"
25060,VI,Beyond whatever is most beyond
25061,VI,"In the uttermost waste of desert sky,              350"
25062,VI,Grows a star;
25063,VI,"And over it, visible spirit of dew,--"
25064,VI,"Ah, stir not, speak not, hold your breath,"
25065,VI,"Or surely the miracle vanisheth,--"
25066,VI,"The new moon, tranced in unspeakable blue!"
25067,VI,"No frail illusion; this were true,"
25068,VI,"Rather, to call it the canoe"
25069,VI,"Hollowed out of a single pearl,"
25070,VI,That floats us from the Present's whirl
25071,VI,"Back to those beings which were ours,              360"
25072,VI,When wishes were wingèd things like powers!

25076,VI,"To indefinable emotion,"
25077,VI,"That glory, mellower than a mist"
25078,VI,"Of pearl dissolved with amethyst,"
25079,VI,"Which rims Square Rock, like what they paint"
25080,VI,Of mitigated heavenly splendor
25081,VI,Round the stern forehead of a Saint!               370
25082,VI,
25083,VI,"No more a vision, reddened, largened,"
25084,VI,"The moon dips toward her mountain nest,"
25085,VI,"And, fringing it with palest argent,"
25086,VI,Slow sheathes herself behind the margent
25087,VI,"Of that long cloud-bar in the West,"
25088,VI,"Whose nether edge, erelong, you see"
25089,VI,"The silvery chrism in turn anoint,"
25090,VI,And then the tiniest rosy point

25092,VI,"Into the dark blue's chilly strip,"
25093,VI,"As some mute, wondering thing below,            381"
25094,VI,"Awakened by the thrilling glow,"
25095,VI,"Might, looking up, see Dian dip"
25096,VI,One lucent foot's delaying tip
25097,VI,In Latmian fountains long ago.

25102,VI,"Here is no sough of branches stirred,"
25103,VI,"Nor noise of any living thing,                  390"
25104,VI,Such as one hears by night on shore;
25105,VI,"Only, now and then, a sigh,"
25106,VI,"With fickle intervals between,"
25107,VI,"Sometimes far, and sometimes nigh,"
25108,VI,"Such as Andromeda might have heard,"
25109,VI,And fancied the huge sea-beast unseen
25110,VI,Turning in sleep; it is the sea
25111,VI,That welters and wavers uneasily.
25112,VI,Round the lonely reefs of Appledore.

25126,THE WIND-HARP,
25127,THE WIND-HARP,I twisted this magic in gossamer strings
25128,THE WIND-HARP,Over a wind-harp's Delphian hollow;

25130,THE WIND-HARP,"All day in the pine-tops, and clings, and sings"

25139,THE WIND-HARP,"When we--' But grief conquered, and all together"
25140,THE WIND-HARP,They swelled such weird murmur as haunts a shore
25141,THE WIND-HARP,"Of some planet dispeopled,--'Nevermore!'"
25142,THE WIND-HARP,
25143,THE WIND-HARP,"Then from deep in the past, as seemed to me,"
25144,THE WIND-HARP,"The strings gathered sorrow and sang forsaken,"
25145,THE WIND-HARP,"'One lover still waits 'neath the greenwood tree,"
25146,THE WIND-HARP,"But 'tis dark,' and they shuddered, 'where lieth she,"
25147,THE WIND-HARP,Dark and cold! Forever must one be taken?'
25148,THE WIND-HARP,"But I groaned, 'O harp of all ruth bereft,"
25149,THE WIND-HARP,"This Scripture is sadder,--""the other left""!'"
25150,THE WIND-HARP,
25151,THE WIND-HARP,"There murmured, as if one strove to speak,"
25152,THE WIND-HARP,And tears came instead; then the sad tones wandered
25153,THE WIND-HARP,And faltered among the uncertain chords
25154,THE WIND-HARP,In a troubled doubt between sorrow and words;
25155,THE WIND-HARP,"At last with themselves they questioned and pondered,"
25156,THE WIND-HARP,'Hereafter?--who knoweth?' and so they sighed
25157,THE WIND-HARP,Down the long steps that lead to silence and died.

25332,THE DEAD HOUSE,Was not in the churchyard then.
25333,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25334,THE DEAD HOUSE,"But, I think, the house is unaltered,"
25335,THE DEAD HOUSE,I will go and beg to look
25336,THE DEAD HOUSE,At the rooms that were once familiar
25337,THE DEAD HOUSE,To my life as its bed to a brook.
25338,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25339,THE DEAD HOUSE,Unaltered! Alas for the sameness
25340,THE DEAD HOUSE,That makes the change but more!
25341,THE DEAD HOUSE,"'Tis a dead man I see in the mirrors,"
25342,THE DEAD HOUSE,'Tis his tread that chills the floor!
25343,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25344,THE DEAD HOUSE,"To learn such a simple lesson,"
25345,THE DEAD HOUSE,"Need I go to Paris and Rome,"
25346,THE DEAD HOUSE,"That the many make the household,"
25347,THE DEAD HOUSE,But only one the home?
25348,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25349,THE DEAD HOUSE,"'Twas just a womanly presence,"
25350,THE DEAD HOUSE,"An influence unexprest,"
25351,THE DEAD HOUSE,"But a rose she had worn, on my gravesod"
25352,THE DEAD HOUSE,Were more than long life with the rest!
25353,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25354,THE DEAD HOUSE,"'Twas a smile, 'twas a garment's rustle,"
25355,THE DEAD HOUSE,'Twas nothing that I can phrase.
25356,THE DEAD HOUSE,"But the whole dumb dwelling grew conscious,"
25357,THE DEAD HOUSE,And put on her looks and ways.
25358,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25359,THE DEAD HOUSE,"Were it mine I would close the shutters,"
25360,THE DEAD HOUSE,"Like lids when the life is fled,"
25361,THE DEAD HOUSE,"And the funeral fire should wind it,"
25362,THE DEAD HOUSE,This corpse of a home that is dead.
25363,THE DEAD HOUSE,
25364,THE DEAD HOUSE,For it died that autumn morning
25365,THE DEAD HOUSE,"When she, its soul, was borne"
25366,THE DEAD HOUSE,To lie all dark on the hillside
25367,THE DEAD HOUSE,That looks over woodland and corn.

25373,A MOOD,I go to the ridge in the forest
25374,A MOOD,"I haunted in days gone by,"
25375,A MOOD,"But thou, O Memory, pourest"
25376,A MOOD,"No magical drop in mine eye,"
25377,A MOOD,Nor the gleam of the secret restorest
25378,A MOOD,That hath faded from earth and sky:
25379,A MOOD,A Presence autumnal and sober
25380,A MOOD,"Invests every rock and tree,"

25382,A MOOD,"Lights the maples, but darkens me."
25383,A MOOD,
25384,A MOOD,"Pine in the distance,"
25385,A MOOD,"Patient through sun or rain,"
25386,A MOOD,"Meeting with graceful persistence,"
25387,A MOOD,"With yielding but rooted resistance,"
25388,A MOOD,"The northwind's wrench and strain,"
25389,A MOOD,No memory of past existence
25390,A MOOD,Brings thee pain;
25391,A MOOD,"Right for the zenith heading,"
25392,A MOOD,"Friendly with heat or cold,"
25393,A MOOD,Thine arms to the influence spreading
25394,A MOOD,"Of the heavens, just from of old,"
25395,A MOOD,"Thou only aspirest the more,"
25396,A MOOD,Unregretful the old leaves shedding
25397,A MOOD,"That fringed thee with music before,"
25398,A MOOD,And deeper thy roots embedding
25399,A MOOD,In the grace and the beauty of yore;
25400,A MOOD,"Thou sigh'st not, 'Alas, I am older,"
25401,A MOOD,The green of last summer is sear!'
25402,A MOOD,"But loftier, hopefuller, bolder,"
25403,A MOOD,Winnest broader horizons each year.
25404,A MOOD,
25405,A MOOD,To me 'tis not cheer thou art singing:
25406,A MOOD,"There's a sound of the sea,"
25407,A MOOD,"O mournful tree,"
25408,A MOOD,"In thy boughs forever clinging,"
25409,A MOOD,And the far-off roar
25410,A MOOD,Of waves on the shore
25411,A MOOD,A shattered vessel flinging.
25412,A MOOD,
25413,A MOOD,As thou musest still of the ocean
25414,A MOOD,"On which thou must float at last,"
25415,A MOOD,And seem'st to foreknow
25416,A MOOD,The shipwreck's woe
25417,A MOOD,"And the sailor wrenched from the broken mast,"
25418,A MOOD,"Do I, in this vague emotion,"
25419,A MOOD,"This sadness that will not pass,"
25420,A MOOD,"Though the air throb with wings,"
25421,A MOOD,"And the field laughs and sings,"
25422,A MOOD,"Do I forebode, alas!"
25423,A MOOD,"The ship-building longer and wearier,"
25424,A MOOD,"The voyage's struggle and strife,"
25425,A MOOD,And then the darker and drearier
25426,A MOOD,Wreck of a broken life?

25435,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,
25436,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Now Biörn, the son of Heriulf, had ill days"
25437,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Because the heart within him seethed with blood
25438,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"That would not be allayed with any toil,"
25439,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Whether of war or hunting or the oar,"
25440,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,But was anhungered for some joy untried:
25441,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"For the brain grew not weary with the limbs,"
25442,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"But, while they slept, still hammered like a Troll,"
25443,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Building all night a bridge of solid dream
25444,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Between him and some purpose of his soul,"
25445,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Or will to find a purpose. With the dawn             10
25446,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"The sleep-laid timbers, crumbled to soft mist,"
25447,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Denied all foothold. But the dream remained,"
25448,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,And every night with yellow-bearded kings
25449,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"His sleep was haunted,--mighty men of old,"
25450,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Once young as he, now ancient like the gods,"
25451,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,And safe as stars in all men's memories.
25452,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Strange sagas read he in their sea-blue eyes
25453,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Cold as the sea, grandly compassionless;"
25454,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Like life, they made him eager and then mocked."
25455,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Nay, broad awake, they would not let him be;           20"
25456,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"They shaped themselves gigantic in the mist,"
25457,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"They rose far-beckoning in the lamps of heaven,"
25458,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"They whispered invitation in the winds,"
25459,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"And breath came from them, mightier than the wind,"
25460,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"To strain the lagging sails of his resolve,"
25461,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Till that grew passion which before was wish,"
25462,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,And youth seemed all too costly to be staked
25463,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"On the soiled cards wherewith men played their game,"
25464,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Letting Time pocket up the larger life,"
25465,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"Lost with base gain of raiment, food, and roof.        30"

25469,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,And those sleep nameless; or renown in war?
25470,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Swords grave no name on the long-memoried rock
25471,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,But moss shall hide it; they alone who wring
25472,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Some secret purpose from the unwilling gods
25473,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,Survive in song for yet a little while
25474,BIÖRN'S BECKONERS,"To vex, like us, the dreams of later men,"

25482,THORWALD'S LAY,"So Biörn went comfortless but for his thought,"
25483,THORWALD'S LAY,"And by his thought the more discomforted,"
25484,THORWALD'S LAY,Till Erle Thurlson kept his Yule-tide feast:
25485,THORWALD'S LAY,"And thither came he, called among the rest,"
25486,THORWALD'S LAY,"Silent, lone-minded, a church-door to mirth;"
25487,THORWALD'S LAY,"But, ere deep draughts forbade such serious song"
25488,THORWALD'S LAY,"As the grave Skald might chant nor after blush,"
25489,THORWALD'S LAY,Then Eric looked at Thorwald where he sat
25490,THORWALD'S LAY,"Mute as a cloud amid the stormy hall,"
25491,THORWALD'S LAY,"And said: 'O Skald, sing now an olden song,            50"
25492,THORWALD'S LAY,Such as our fathers heard who led great lives;
25493,THORWALD'S LAY,"And, as the bravest on a shield is borne"
25494,THORWALD'S LAY,"Along the waving host that shouts him king,"
25495,THORWALD'S LAY,So rode their thrones upon the thronging seas!'
25496,THORWALD'S LAY,"Then the old man arose; white-haired he stood,"
25497,THORWALD'S LAY,"White-bearded, and with eyes that looked afar"
25498,THORWALD'S LAY,"From their still region of perpetual snow,"
25499,THORWALD'S LAY,Beyond the little smokes and stirs of men:
25500,THORWALD'S LAY,"His head was bowed with gathered flakes of years,"
25501,THORWALD'S LAY,"As winter bends the sea-foreboding pine,                60"
25502,THORWALD'S LAY,"But something triumphed in his brow and eye,"
25503,THORWALD'S LAY,Which whoso saw it could not see and crouch:
25504,THORWALD'S LAY,"Loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused,"
25505,THORWALD'S LAY,"Brooding his eyried thoughts; then, as an eagle"
25506,THORWALD'S LAY,"Circles smooth-winged above the wind-vexed woods,"
25507,THORWALD'S LAY,So wheeled his soul into the air of song
25508,THORWALD'S LAY,High o'er the stormy hall; and thus he sang:
25509,THORWALD'S LAY,'The fletcher for his arrow-shaft picks out
25510,THORWALD'S LAY,"Wood closest-grained, long-seasoned, straight as light;"
25511,THORWALD'S LAY,And from a quiver full of such as these             70
25512,THORWALD'S LAY,"The wary bowman, matched against his peers,"
25513,THORWALD'S LAY,"Long doubting, singles yet once more the best."
25514,THORWALD'S LAY,Who is it needs such flawless shafts as Fate?
25515,THORWALD'S LAY,"What archer of his arrows is so choice,"
25516,THORWALD'S LAY,"Or hits the white so surely? They are men,"
25517,THORWALD'S LAY,The chosen of her quiver; nor for her
25518,THORWALD'S LAY,"Will every reed suffice, or cross-grained stick"
25519,THORWALD'S LAY,At random from life's vulgar fagot plucked:
25520,THORWALD'S LAY,Such answer household ends; but she will have
25521,THORWALD'S LAY,"Souls straight and clear, of toughest fibre, sound     80"
25522,THORWALD'S LAY,Down to the heart of heart; from these she strips
25523,THORWALD'S LAY,"All needless stuff, all sapwood; seasons them;"
25524,THORWALD'S LAY,From circumstance untoward feathers plucks
25525,THORWALD'S LAY,Crumpled and cheap; and barbs with iron will:
25526,THORWALD'S LAY,The hour that passes is her quiver-boy:
25527,THORWALD'S LAY,"When she draws bow, 'tis not across the wind,"
25528,THORWALD'S LAY,"Nor 'gainst the sun her haste-snatched arrow sings,"
25529,THORWALD'S LAY,For sun and wind have plighted faith to her:
25530,THORWALD'S LAY,"Ere men have heard the sinew twang, behold"
25531,THORWALD'S LAY,In the butt's heart her trembling messenger!        90
25532,THORWALD'S LAY,
25533,THORWALD'S LAY,'The song is old and simple that I sing;
25534,THORWALD'S LAY,"But old and simple are despised as cheap,"
25535,THORWALD'S LAY,Though hardest to achieve of human things:
25536,THORWALD'S LAY,"Good were the days of yore, when men were tried"
25537,THORWALD'S LAY,"By ring of shields, as now by ring of words;"
25538,THORWALD'S LAY,"But while the gods are left, and hearts of men,"
25539,THORWALD'S LAY,"And wide-doored ocean, still the days are good."
25540,THORWALD'S LAY,"Still o'er the earth hastes Opportunity,"
25541,THORWALD'S LAY,Seeking the hardy soul that seeks for her.
25542,THORWALD'S LAY,"Be not abroad, nor deaf with household cares       100"
25543,THORWALD'S LAY,That chatter loudest as they mean the least;
25544,THORWALD'S LAY,Swift-willed is thrice-willed; late means nevermore;
25545,THORWALD'S LAY,"Impatient is her foot, nor turns again.'"
25546,THORWALD'S LAY,He ceased; upon his bosom sank his beard
25547,THORWALD'S LAY,"Sadly, as one who oft had seen her pass"
25548,THORWALD'S LAY,Nor stayed her: and forthwith the frothy tide
25549,THORWALD'S LAY,Of interrupted wassail roared along.
25550,THORWALD'S LAY,"But Biörn, the son of Heriulf, sat apart"
25551,THORWALD'S LAY,"Musing, and, with his eyes upon the fire,"
25552,THORWALD'S LAY,"Saw shapes of arrows, lost as soon as seen.     110"
25553,THORWALD'S LAY,"'A ship,' he muttered,'is a wingèd bridge"
25554,THORWALD'S LAY,"That leadeth every way to man's desire,"
25555,THORWALD'S LAY,And ocean the wide gate to manful luck.'
25556,THORWALD'S LAY,"And then with that resolve his heart was bent,"
25557,THORWALD'S LAY,"Which, like a humming shaft, through many a stripe"
25558,THORWALD'S LAY,"Of day and night, across the unpathwayed seas"
25559,THORWALD'S LAY,Shot the brave prow that cut on Vinland sands
25560,THORWALD'S LAY,The first rune in the Saga of the West.

26033,VI,"When summer days pass,                 160"
26034,VI,So that when thy wave hardens
26035,VI,"It shapes as it pleases,"
26036,VI,"Unharmed by the breezes,"
26037,VI,Its fine hanging gardens?
26038,VI,Hast those in thy keeping.
26039,VI,"And canst not uncover,"
26040,VI,"Enchantedly sleeping,"
26041,VI,The old shade of thy lover?
26042,VI,It is there! I have found it!
26043,VI,"He wakes, the long sleeper!            170"
26044,VI,"The pool is grown deeper,"
26045,VI,"The sand dance is ending,"
26046,VI,"The white floor sinks, blending"
26047,VI,With skies that below me
26048,VI,"Are deepening and bending,"
26049,VI,And a child's face alone
26050,VI,"That seems not to know me,"
26051,VI,With hair that fades golden
26052,VI,"In the heaven-glow round it,"
26053,VI,Looks up at my own;                    180
26054,VI,"Ah, glimpse through the portal"
26055,VI,"That leads to the throne,"
26056,VI,That opes the child's olden
26057,VI,Regions Elysian!
26058,VI,"Ah, too holy vision"
26059,VI,For thy skirts to be holden
26060,VI,By soiled hand of mortal!
26061,VI,"It wavers, it scatters,"
26062,VI,'Tis gone past recalling!
26063,VI,A tear's sudden falling                190
26064,VI,"The magic cup shatters,"
26065,VI,"Breaks the spell of the waters,"
26066,VI,"And the sand cone once more,"
26067,VI,"With a ceaseless renewing,"
26068,VI,Its dance is pursuing
26069,VI,"On the silvery floor,"
26070,VI,"O'er and o'er,"
26071,VI,With a noiseless and ceaseless renewing.
26072,VI,

26078,VII,''Tis past my disclosing;'
26079,VII,Not to choice is it granted
26080,VII,By sure paths to visit
26081,VII,The still pool enclosing
26082,VII,Its blithe little dancer;
26083,VII,"But in some day, the rarest"
26084,VII,"Of many Septembers,"
26085,VII,"When the pulses of air rest,"
26086,VII,And all things lie dreaming            210
26087,VII,In drowsy haze steaming
26088,VII,"From the wood's glowing embers,"
26089,VII,"Then, sometimes, unheeding,"
26090,VII,"And asking not whither,"
26091,VII,By a sweet inward leading
26092,VII,"My feet are drawn thither,"
26093,VII,"And, looking with awe in the magical mirror,"
26094,VII,"I see through my tears,"
26095,VII,"Half doubtful of seeing,"
26096,VII,"The face unperverted,                  220"
26097,VII,The warm golden being
26098,VII,Of a child of five years;
26099,VII,And spite of the mists and the error.
26100,VII,"And the days overcast,"
26101,VII,"Can feel that I walk undeserted,"
26102,VII,But forever attended
26103,VII,By the glad heavens that bended
26104,VII,O'er the innocent past;
26105,VII,Toward fancy or truth
26106,VII,Doth the sweet vision win me?          230
26107,VII,Dare I think that I cast
26108,VII,In the fountain of youth
26109,VII,The fleeting reflection
26110,VII,Of some bygone perfection
26111,VII,That still lingers in me?

26130,YUSSOUF,

26136,YUSSOUF,So nobleness enkindleth nobleness.
26137,YUSSOUF,
26138,YUSSOUF,"That inward light the stranger's face made grand,"
26139,YUSSOUF,"Which shines from all self-conquest; kneeling low,"
26140,YUSSOUF,"He bowed his forehead upon Yussouf's hand,"
26141,YUSSOUF,"Sobbing: 'O Sheik, I cannot leave thee so;"
26142,YUSSOUF,I will repay thee; all this thou hast done
26143,YUSSOUF,Unto that Ibrahim who slew thy son!'

26434,VII,In Arctic outskirts of the brain:

27223,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,He knows enough who silent knows
27224,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,The quiver chiming as he goes;

27259,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"At first they're but the unfledged proem,"
27260,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,Or songless schedule of a poem;

27267,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"(And there's where I shall beat them hollow,"
27268,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"If he indeed's no courtly St. John,"
27269,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"But, as West said, a Mohawk Injun.)"
27270,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,A poem's like a cruise for whales:
27271,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Through untried seas the hunter sails,"
27272,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,His prow dividing waters known
27273,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,To the blue iceberg's hulk alone;                 160
27274,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"At last, on farthest edge of day,"
27275,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,He marks the smoky puff of spray;
27276,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,Then with bent oars the shallop flies
27277,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,To where the basking quarry lies;
27278,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Then the excitement of the strife,"
27279,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"The crimsoned waves,--ah, this is life!"
27280,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,
27281,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"But, the dead plunder once secured"

27285,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"(I mean no pun, nor image so"
27286,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Mere sentimental verse, you know,)"
27287,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"And all is tedium, smoke, and soil,"
27288,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,In trying out the noisome oil.
27289,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,
27290,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Yes, this _is_ life! And so the bard"
27291,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Through briny deserts, never scarred"
27292,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Since Noah's keel, a subject seeks,"
27293,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,And lies upon the watch for weeks;
27294,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"That once harpooned and helpless lying,"

27300,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"By day or night won't let me be,"
27301,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"And hang about me like a curse,"
27302,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Till they have made me into verse,"
27303,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,From line to line my fingers tease
27304,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Beyond my knowledge, as the bees"
27305,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,Build no new cell till those before
27306,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,With limpid summer-sweet run o'er;                 190
27307,A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,"Then, if I neither sing nor shine,"

27315,AN EMBER PICTURE,"The lessons of life we forget,"
27316,AN EMBER PICTURE,"While a trifle, a trick of color,"
27317,AN EMBER PICTURE,"In the wonderful web is set,--"

27322,AN EMBER PICTURE,Insists on its right to be there.
27323,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27324,AN EMBER PICTURE,A chance had brought us together;
27325,AN EMBER PICTURE,Our talk was of matters-of-course;
27326,AN EMBER PICTURE,"We were nothing, one to the other,"
27327,AN EMBER PICTURE,But a short half-hour's resource.
27328,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27329,AN EMBER PICTURE,"We spoke of French acting and actors,"
27330,AN EMBER PICTURE,"And their easy, natural way:"
27331,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Of the weather, for it was raining,"
27332,AN EMBER PICTURE,As we drove home from the play.
27333,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27334,AN EMBER PICTURE,We debated the social nothings
27335,AN EMBER PICTURE,We bore ourselves so to discuss;
27336,AN EMBER PICTURE,The thunderous rumors of battle
27337,AN EMBER PICTURE,Were silent the while for us.
27338,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27339,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Arrived at her door, we left her"
27340,AN EMBER PICTURE,"With a drippingly hurried adieu,"
27341,AN EMBER PICTURE,And our wheels went crunching the gravel
27342,AN EMBER PICTURE,Of the oak-darkened avenue.
27343,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27344,AN EMBER PICTURE,"As we drove away through the shadow,"
27345,AN EMBER PICTURE,The candle she held in the door
27346,AN EMBER PICTURE,From rain-varnished tree-trunk to tree-trunk
27347,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Flashed fainter, and flashed no more;--"
27348,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27349,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Flashed fainter, then wholly faded"
27350,AN EMBER PICTURE,Before we had passed the wood;
27351,AN EMBER PICTURE,But the light of the face behind it
27352,AN EMBER PICTURE,Went with me and stayed for good.
27353,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27354,AN EMBER PICTURE,"The vision of scarce a moment,"
27355,AN EMBER PICTURE,"And hardly marked at the time,"
27356,AN EMBER PICTURE,"It comes unbidden to haunt me,"
27357,AN EMBER PICTURE,Like a scrap of ballad-rhyme.
27358,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27359,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Had she beauty? Well, not what they call so;"
27360,AN EMBER PICTURE,You may find a thousand as fair;
27361,AN EMBER PICTURE,And yet there's her face in my memory
27362,AN EMBER PICTURE,With no special claim to be there.
27363,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27364,AN EMBER PICTURE,"As I sit sometimes in the twilight,"
27365,AN EMBER PICTURE,And call back to life in the coals
27366,AN EMBER PICTURE,Old faces and hopes and fancies
27367,AN EMBER PICTURE,"Long buried, (good rest to their souls!)"
27368,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27369,AN EMBER PICTURE,Her face shines out in the embers;
27370,AN EMBER PICTURE,"I see her holding the light,"
27371,AN EMBER PICTURE,And hear the crunch of the gravel
27372,AN EMBER PICTURE,And the sweep of the rain that night.
27373,AN EMBER PICTURE,
27374,AN EMBER PICTURE,"'Tis a face that can never grow older,"
27375,AN EMBER PICTURE,"That never can part with its gleam,"

27986,II,"Where every hope was new,"
27987,II,"_How sweet were life!_ Yet, by the mouth firm-set,"
27988,II,"And look made up for Duty's utmost debt,"
27989,II,I could divine he knew
27990,II,"That death within the sulphurous hostile lines,"
27991,II,"In the mere wreck of nobly pitched designs,"
27992,II,"Plucks heart's-ease, and not rue.                40"
27993,II,
27994,II,Happy their end
27995,II,Who vanish down life's evening stream
27996,II,Placid as swans that drift in dream
27997,II,Round the next river-bend!
27998,II,"Happy long life, with honor at the close,"
27999,II,"Friends' painless tears, the softened thought of foes!"
28000,II,"And yet, like him, to spend"
28001,II,"All at a gush, keeping our first faith sure"

28005,II,"Right in the van,"

28007,II,"With heart that beat a charge, he fell"
28008,II,"Foeward, as fits a man;"
28009,II,But the high soul burns on to light men's feet
28010,II,Where death for noble ends makes dying sweet;
28011,II,His life her crescent's span
28012,II,Orbs full with share in their undarkening days
28013,II,Who ever climbed the battailous steeps of praise

28034,III,Hope's forlorn-hopes that plant the desperate good
28035,III,For nobler Earths and days of manlier mood;

28038,III,"A saintly shape of fame, to cheer the right"

28168,II,"No lore of Greece or Rome,"
28169,II,"No science peddling with the names of things,       20"

28180,II,"From happy homes and toils, the fruitful nest"
28181,II,"Of those half-virtues which the world calls best,"
28182,II,Into War's tumult rude;
28183,II,But rather far that stern device
28184,II,The sponsors chose that round thy cradle stood

28203,III,"So loved her that they died for her,      50"

28229,IV,Some more substantial boon

28237,IV,"Life seems a fest of Fate's contriving,      80"

28253,IV,To claim its birthright with the hosts of heaven;
28254,IV,A seed of sunshine that can leaven
28255,IV,"Our earthly dullness with the beams of stars,"
28256,IV,And glorify our clay
28257,IV,With light from fountains elder than the Day;          100
28258,IV,"A conscience more divine than we,"
28259,IV,"A gladness fed with secret tears,"
28260,IV,"A vexing, forward-reaching sense"
28261,IV,Of some more noble permanence;
28262,IV,"A light across the sea,"
28263,IV,"Which haunts the soul and will not let it be,"

28273,V,"Of youth's vainglorious weeds,"
28274,V,"But up the steep, amid the wrath"

28276,V,Where the world's best hope and stay

28286,V,"Of God's pure altar brought,"
28287,V,Bursts up in flame; the war of tongue and pen
28288,V,"Learns with what deadly purpose it was fraught,"
28289,V,"And, helpless in the fiery passion caught,"
28290,V,Shakes all the pillared state with shock of men:
28291,V,Some day the soft Ideal that we wooed                    130
28292,V,"Confronts us fiercely, foe-beset, pursued,"
28293,V,"And cries reproachful: 'Was it, then, my praise,"
28294,V,And not myself was loved? Prove now thy truth;
28295,V,I claim of thee the promise of thy youth;
28296,V,"Give me thy life, or cower in empty phrase,"
28297,V,"The victim of thy genius, not its mate!'"
28298,V,"Life may be given in many ways,"
28299,V,And loyalty to Truth be sealed
28300,V,"As bravely in the closet as the field,"
28301,V,So bountiful is Fate;                                140
28302,V,"But then to stand beside her,"
28303,V,"When craven churls deride her,"
28304,V,"To front a lie in arms and not to yield,"
28305,V,"This shows, methinks, God's plan"
28306,V,"And measure of a stalwart man,"
28307,V,"Limbed like the old heroic breeds,"
28308,V,"Who stands self-poised on manhood's solid earth,"

28317,VI,"With ashes on her head,"
28318,VI,Wept with the passion of an angry grief:
28319,VI,"Forgive me, if from present things I turn"
28320,VI,"To speak what in my heart will beat and burn,"
28321,VI,And hang my wreath on his world-honored urn.
28322,VI,"Nature, they say, doth dote,"
28323,VI,And cannot make a man
28324,VI,"Save on some worn-out plan,"
28325,VI,Repeating as by rote:      160

28330,VI,"Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true,"
28331,VI,How beautiful to see
28332,VI,"Once more a shepherd of mankind indeed,"
28333,VI,"Who loved his charge, but never loved to lead;"
28334,VI,"One whose meek flock the people joyed to be,"
28335,VI,"Not lured by any cheat of birth,      170"
28336,VI,"But by his clear-grained human worth,"
28337,VI,And brave old wisdom of sincerity!
28338,VI,They knew that outward grace is dust;
28339,VI,They could not choose but trust
28340,VI,"In that sure-footed mind's unfaltering skill,"
28341,VI,And supple-tempered will
28342,VI,That bent like perfect steel to spring again and thrust.
28343,VI,His was no lonely mountain-peak of mind.
28344,VI,"Thrusting to thin air o'er our cloudy bars,"
28345,VI,"A sea-mark now, now lost in vapors blind;      180"
28346,VI,"Broad prairie rather, genial, level-lined,"
28347,VI,"Fruitful and friendly for all human kind,"
28348,VI,Yet also nigh to heaven and loved of loftiest stars.
28349,VI,"Nothing of Europe here,"
28350,VI,"Or, then, of Europe fronting mornward still,"
28351,VI,Ere any names of Serf and Peer
28352,VI,Could Nature's equal scheme deface
28353,VI,And thwart her genial will;
28354,VI,"Here was a type of the true elder race,"
28355,VI,And one of Plutarch's men talked with us face to face.      190
28356,VI,I praise him not; it were too late;
28357,VI,And some innative weakness there must be
28358,VI,In him who condescends to victory
28359,VI,"Such as the Present gives, and cannot wait,"
28360,VI,"Safe in himself as in a fate,"
28361,VI,So always firmly he:
28362,VI,"He knew to bide his time,"
28363,VI,"And can his fame abide,"
28364,VI,"Still patient in his simple faith sublime,"
28365,VI,Till the wise years decide.
28366,VI,"Great captains, with their guns and drums,      201"
28367,VI,"Disturb our judgment for the hour,"
28368,VI,But at last silence comes;
28369,VI,"These all are gone, and, standing like a tower."
28370,VI,"Our children shall behold his fame,"
28371,VI,"The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man."
28372,VI,"Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame,"
28373,VI,"New birth of our new soil, the first American."
28374,VI,
28375,VI,
28376,VII,VII
28377,VII,
28378,VII,Long as man's hope insatiate can discern
28379,VII,Or only guess some more inspiring goal      210
28380,VII,"Outside of Self, enduring as the pole,"
28381,VII,Along whose course the flying axles burn
28382,VII,"Of spirits bravely pitched, earth's manlier brood,"
28383,VII,Long as below we cannot find
28384,VII,The meed that stills the inexorable mind;
28385,VII,"So long this faith to some ideal Good,"
28386,VII,"Under whatever mortal names it masks,"
28387,VII,"Freedom, Law, Country, this ethereal mood"
28388,VII,"That thanks the Fates for their severer tasks,"
28389,VII,"Feeling its challenged pulses leap,     220"
28390,VII,"While others skulk in subterfuges cheap,"
28391,VII,"And, set in Danger's van, has all the boon it asks,"
28392,VII,"Shall win man's praise and woman's love,"
28393,VII,Shall be a wisdom that we set above
28394,VII,"All other skills and gifts to culture dear,"
28395,VII,A virtue round whose forehead we inwreathe
28396,VII,Laurels that with a living passion breathe
28397,VII,"When other crowns grow, while we twine them, sear."
28398,VII,"What brings us thronging these high rites to pay,"
28399,VII,"And seal these hours the noblest of our year,     230"
28400,VII,Save that our brothers found this better way?
28401,VII,
28402,VII,
28403,VIII,VIII
28404,VIII,
28405,VIII,We sit here in the Promised Land
28406,VIII,That flows with Freedom's honey and milk;
28407,VIII,"But 'twas they won it, sword in hand,"
28408,VIII,Making the nettle danger soft for us as silk.
28409,VIII,We welcome back our bravest and our best;--
28410,VIII,"Ah me! not all! some come not with the rest,"
28411,VIII,Who went forth brave and bright as any here!
28412,VIII,"I strive to mix some gladness with my strain,"
28413,VIII,"But the sad strings complain,     240"
28414,VIII,And will not please the ear:
28415,VIII,"I sweep them for a pæan, but they wane"
28416,VIII,Again and yet again
28417,VIII,"Into a dirge, and die away, in pain."
28418,VIII,"In these brave ranks I only see the gaps,"
28419,VIII,"Thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps,"
28420,VIII,Dark to the triumph which they died to gain:
28421,VIII,"Fitlier may others greet the living,"
28422,VIII,For me the past is unforgiving;
28423,VIII,I with uncovered head      250
28424,VIII,"Salute the sacred dead,"
28425,VIII,"Who went, and who return not.--Say not so!"
28426,VIII,"'Tis not the grapes of Canaan that repay,"
28427,VIII,But the high faith that failed not by the way;
28428,VIII,Virtue treads paths that end not in the grave;
28429,VIII,No ban of endless night exiles the brave;
28430,VIII,And to the saner mind
28431,VIII,We rather seem the dead that stayed behind.
28432,VIII,"Blow, trumpets, all your exultations blow!"
28433,VIII,For never shall their aureoled presence lack:      260
28434,VIII,"I see them muster in a gleaming row,"
28435,VIII,With ever-youthful brows that nobler show;
28436,VIII,We find in our dull road their shining track;
28437,VIII,In every nobler mood
28438,VIII,"We feel the orient of their spirit glow,"
28439,VIII,"Part of our life's unalterable good,"
28440,VIII,Of all our saintlier aspiration;
28441,VIII,"They come transfigured back,"
28442,VIII,"Secure from change in their high-hearted ways,"
28443,VIII,"Beautiful evermore, and with the rays              270"
28444,VIII,Of morn on their white Shields of Expectation!
28445,VIII,
28446,VIII,
28447,IX,IX
28448,IX,
28449,IX,But is there hope to save
28450,IX,Even this ethereal essence from the grave?
28451,IX,What ever 'scaped Oblivion's subtle wrong
28452,IX,"Save a few clarion names, or golden threads of song?"
28453,IX,Before my musing eye
28454,IX,"The mighty ones of old sweep by,"
28455,IX,"Disvoicèd now and insubstantial things,"
28456,IX,"As noisy once as we; poor ghosts of kings,"
28457,IX,"Shadows of empire wholly gone to dust,           280"
28458,IX,"And many races, nameless long ago,"
28459,IX,To darkness driven by that imperious gust
28460,IX,Of ever-rushing Time that here doth blow:
28461,IX,"O visionary world, condition strange,"
28462,IX,"Where naught abiding is but only Change,"
28463,IX,Where the deep-bolted stars themselves still shift and range!
28464,IX,Shall we to more continuance make pretence?
28465,IX,"Renown builds tombs, a life-estate is Wit;"
28466,IX,"And, bit by bit,"
28467,IX,The cunning years steal all from us but woe;       290
28468,IX,"Leaves are we, whose decays no harvest sow."
28469,IX,"But, when we vanish hence,"
28470,IX,"Shall they lie forceless in the dark below,"
28471,IX,"Save to make green their little length of souls,"
28472,IX,"Or deepen pansies for a year or two,"
28473,IX,Who now to us are shining-sweet as gods?
28474,IX,Was dying all they had the skill to do?
28475,IX,That were not fruitless: but the Soul resents
28476,IX,"Such short-lived service, as if blind events"
28477,IX,"Ruled without her, or earth could so endure;       300"
28478,IX,She claims a more divine investiture
28479,IX,Of longer tenure than Fame's airy rents;
28480,IX,Whate'er she touches doth her nature share;
28481,IX,"Her inspiration haunts the ennobled air,"
28482,IX,"Gives eyes to mountains blind,"
28483,IX,"Ears to the deaf earth, voices to the wind,"
28484,IX,And her clear trump slugs succor everywhere
28485,IX,By lonely bivouacs to the wakeful mind;
28486,IX,For soul inherits all that soul could dare:
28487,IX,"Yea, Manhood hath a wider span               310"
28488,IX,And larger privilege of life than man.
28489,IX,"The single deed, the private sacrifice,"
28490,IX,"So radiant now through proudly-hidden tears,"
28491,IX,Is covered up erelong from mortal eyes
28492,IX,With thoughtless drift of the deciduous years;
28493,IX,"But that high privilege that makes all men peers,"
28494,IX,That leap of heart whereby a people rise
28495,IX,"Up to a noble anger's height,"
28496,IX,"And, flamed on by the Fates, not shrink, but grow more bright,"
28497,IX,"That swift validity in noble veins,             320"
28498,IX,"Of choosing danger and disdaining shame,"
28499,IX,Of being set on flame
28500,IX,By the pure fire that flies all contact base
28501,IX,"But wraps its chosen with angelic might,"
28502,IX,"These are imperishable gains,"
28503,IX,"Sure as the sun, medicinal as light,"
28504,IX,These hold great futures in their lusty reins
28505,IX,And certify to earth a new imperial race.

28512,X,Our lines to a plebeian race?
28513,X,Roundhead and Cavalier!
28514,X,Dumb are those names erewhile in battle loud;
28515,X,"Dream-footed as the shadow of a cloud,"
28516,X,They flit across the ear:
28517,X,"That is best blood that hath most iron in 't,"
28518,X,"To edge resolve with, pouring without stint"
28519,X,For what makes manhood dear.
28520,X,"Tell us not of Plantagenets,"
28521,X,"Hapsburgs, and Guelfs, whose thin bloods crawl     340"
28522,X,Down from some victor in a border-brawl!
28523,X,"How poor their outworn coronets,"
28524,X,Matched with one leaf of that plain civic wreath
28525,X,"Our brave for honor's blazon shall bequeath,"
28526,X,Through whose desert a rescued Nation sets
28527,X,"Her heel on treason, and the trumpet hears"
28528,X,"Shout victory, tingling Europe's sullen ears"
28529,X,With vain resentments and more vain regrets!

28532,XI,XI
28533,XI,
28534,XI,"Not in anger, not in pride,"
28535,XI,Pure from passion's mixture rude                350
28536,XI,"Ever to base earth allied,"
28537,XI,"But with far-heard gratitude,"
28538,XI,"Still with heart and voice renewed,"
28539,XI,"To heroes living and dear martyrs dead,"
28540,XI,The strain should close that consecrates our brave.
28541,XI,Lift the heart and lift the head!
28542,XI,"Lofty be its mood and grave,"
28543,XI,"Not without a martial ring,"
28544,XI,Not without a prouder tread
28545,XI,And a peal of exultation:                      360
28546,XI,Little right has he to sing
28547,XI,Through whose heart in such an hour
28548,XI,"Beats no march of conscious power,"
28549,XI,Sweeps no tumult of elation!
28550,XI,"'Tis no Man we celebrate,"
28551,XI,"By his country's victories great,"
28552,XI,"A hero half, and half the whim of Fate,"
28553,XI,But the pith and marrow of a Nation
28554,XI,"Drawing force from all her men,"
28555,XI,"Highest, humblest, weakest, all,               370"
28556,XI,"For her time of need, and then"
28557,XI,"Pulsing it again through them,"
28558,XI,"Till the basest can no longer cower,"
28559,XI,"Feeling his soul spring up divinely tall,"
28560,XI,Touched but in passing by her mantle-hem.
28561,XI,"Come back, then, noble pride, for 'tis her dower!"
28562,XI,"How could poet ever tower,"
28563,XI,"If his passions, hopes, and fears,"
28564,XI,"If his triumphs and his tears,"
28565,XI,Kept not measure with his people?              380
28566,XI,"Boom, cannon, boom to all the winds and waves!"
28567,XI,"Clash out, glad bells, from every rocking steeple!"
28568,XI,"Banners, adance with triumph, bend your staves!"
28569,XI,And from every mountain-peak
28570,XI,"Let beacon-fire to answering beacon speak,"
28571,XI,"Katahdin tell Monadnock, Whiteface he,"
28572,XI,"And so leap on in light from sea to sea,"
28573,XI,Till the glad news be sent
28574,XI,"Across a kindling continent,"
28575,XI,Making earth feel more firm and air breathe braver:      390
28576,XI,"'Be proud! for she is saved, and all have helped to save her!"
28577,XI,"She that lifts up the manhood of the poor,"
28578,XI,"She of the open soul and open door,"
28579,XI,With room about her hearth for all mankind!
28580,XI,The fire is dreadful in her eyes no more;
28581,XI,"From her bold front the helm she doth unbind,"
28582,XI,"Sends all her handmaid armies back to spin,"
28583,XI,"And bids her navies, that so lately hurled"
28584,XI,"Their crashing battle, hold their thunders in,"
28585,XI,Swimming like birds of calm along the unharmful shore.     400
28586,XI,"No challenge sends she to the elder world,"
28587,XI,That looked askance and hated; a light scorn
28588,XI,"Plays o'er her mouth, as round her mighty knees"
28589,XI,"She calls her children back, and waits the morn"
28590,XI,"Of nobler day, enthroned between her subject seas.'"

28594,XII,
28595,XII,"Bow down, dear Land, for thou hast found release!"
28596,XII,"Thy God, in these distempered days,"
28597,XII,"Hath taught thee the sure wisdom of his ways,"
28598,XII,And through thine enemies hath wrought thy peace!
28599,XII,Bow down in prayer and praise!                  410
28600,XII,No poorest in thy borders but may now
28601,XII,Lift to the juster skies a man's enfranchised brow.
28602,XII,O Beautiful! my Country! ours once more!
28603,XII,Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair
28604,XII,"O'er such sweet brows as never other wore,"
28605,XII,"And letting thy set lips,"
28606,XII,"Freed from wrath's pale eclipse,"
28607,XII,"The rosy edges of their smile lay bare,"
28608,XII,What words divine of lover or of poet
28609,XII,"Could tell our love and make thee know it,         420"
28610,XII,Among the Nations bright beyond compare?
28611,XII,What were our lives without thee?
28612,XII,What all our lives to save thee?
28613,XII,We reck not what we gave thee;
28614,XII,"We will not dare to doubt thee,"
28615,XII,"But ask whatever else, and we will dare!"

28628,TO THE MUSE,"I haunt the pine-dark solitudes,"

28731,TO THE MUSE,"Of duty, music all her own;"
28732,TO THE MUSE,Still as of old she sits and spins
28733,TO THE MUSE,"Our hopes, our sorrows, and our sins;"
28734,TO THE MUSE,With equal care she twines the fates
28735,TO THE MUSE,Of cottages and mighty states;
28736,TO THE MUSE,"She spins the earth, the air, the sea,"
28737,TO THE MUSE,"The maiden's unschooled fancy free,               110"
28738,TO THE MUSE,"The boy's first love, the man's first grief,"
28739,TO THE MUSE,The budding and the fall o' the leaf;
28740,TO THE MUSE,The piping west-wind's snowy care
28741,TO THE MUSE,"For her their cloudy fleeces spare,"
28742,TO THE MUSE,Or from the thorns of evil times
28743,TO THE MUSE,She can glean wool to twist her rhymes;
28744,TO THE MUSE,Morning and noon and eve supply
28745,TO THE MUSE,"To her their fairest tints for dye,"
28746,TO THE MUSE,But ever through her twirling thread
28747,TO THE MUSE,"There spires one line of warmest red,             120"
28748,TO THE MUSE,"Tinged from the homestead's genial heart,"
28749,TO THE MUSE,The stamp and warrant of her art;
28750,TO THE MUSE,"With this Time's sickle she outwears,"
28751,TO THE MUSE,And blunts the Sisters' baffled shears.
28752,TO THE MUSE,
28753,TO THE MUSE,'Harass her not: thy heat and stir
28754,TO THE MUSE,But greater coyness breed in her;
28755,TO THE MUSE,"Yet thou mayst find, ere Age's frost,"
28756,TO THE MUSE,"Thy long apprenticeship not lost,"
28757,TO THE MUSE,Learning at last that Stygian Fate
28758,TO THE MUSE,Unbends to him that knows to wait.                130
28759,TO THE MUSE,"The Muse is womanish, nor deigns"
28760,TO THE MUSE,Her love to him that pules and plains;
28761,TO THE MUSE,"With proud, averted face she stands"
28762,TO THE MUSE,To him that wooes with empty hands.
28763,TO THE MUSE,Make thyself free of Manhood's guild;
28764,TO THE MUSE,Pull down thy barns and greater build;
28765,TO THE MUSE,"The wood, the mountain, and the plain"
28766,TO THE MUSE,Wave breast-deep with the poet's grain;
28767,TO THE MUSE,"Pluck thou the sunset's fruit of gold,"
28768,TO THE MUSE,Glean from the heavens and ocean old;             140
28769,TO THE MUSE,From fireside lone and trampling street
28770,TO THE MUSE,Let thy life garner daily wheat;
28771,TO THE MUSE,"The epic of a man rehearse,"
28772,TO THE MUSE,Be something better than thy verse;
28773,TO THE MUSE,"Make thyself rich, and then the Muse"
28774,TO THE MUSE,"Shall court thy precious interviews,"
28775,TO THE MUSE,"Shall take thy head upon her knee,"
28776,TO THE MUSE,"And such enchantment lilt to thee,"
28777,TO THE MUSE,That thou shalt hear the life-blood flow
28778,TO THE MUSE,"From farthest stars to grass-blades low,          150"
28779,TO THE MUSE,And find the Listener's science still
28780,TO THE MUSE,Transcends the Singer's deepest skill!'

28795,MY DEAR FIELDS:,Dr. Johnson's sturdy self-respect led him to invent the Bookseller as a
28796,MY DEAR FIELDS:,substitute for the Patron. My relations with you have enabled me to
28797,MY DEAR FIELDS:,discover how pleasantly the Friend may replace the Bookseller. Let me
28798,MY DEAR FIELDS:,record my sense of many thoughtful services by associating your name
28799,MY DEAR FIELDS:,with a poem which owes its appearance in this form to your partiality.

28810,J.R. LOWELL.,"Cloudless of care, down-shod to every sense,"
28811,J.R. LOWELL.,"And simply perfect from its own resource,"
28812,J.R. LOWELL.,As to a bee the new campanula's
28813,J.R. LOWELL.,Illuminate seclusion swung in air.
28814,J.R. LOWELL.,"Such days are not the prey of setting suns,"
28815,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor ever blurred with mist of afterthought;
28816,J.R. LOWELL.,"Like words made magical by poets dead,"
28817,J.R. LOWELL.,Wherein the music of all meaning is
28818,J.R. LOWELL.,"The sense hath garnered or the soul divined,       10"
28819,J.R. LOWELL.,"They mingle with our life's ethereal part,"
28820,J.R. LOWELL.,"Sweetening and gathering sweetness evermore,"
28821,J.R. LOWELL.,By beauty's franchise disenthralled of time.
28822,J.R. LOWELL.,
28823,J.R. LOWELL.,"I can recall, nay, they are present still,"
28824,J.R. LOWELL.,"Parts of myself, the perfume of my mind,"
28825,J.R. LOWELL.,Days that seem farther off than Homer's now
28826,J.R. LOWELL.,"Ere yet the child had loudened to the boy,"
28827,J.R. LOWELL.,"And I, recluse from playmates, found perforce"
28828,J.R. LOWELL.,Companionship in things that not denied
28829,J.R. LOWELL.,"Nor granted wholly; as is Nature's wont,           20"
28830,J.R. LOWELL.,"Who, safe in uncontaminate reserve,"
28831,J.R. LOWELL.,"Lets us mistake our longing for her love,"
28832,J.R. LOWELL.,And mocks with various echo of ourselves.
28833,J.R. LOWELL.,
28834,J.R. LOWELL.,"These first sweet frauds upon our consciousness,"
28835,J.R. LOWELL.,"That blend the sensual with its imaged world,"
28836,J.R. LOWELL.,"These virginal cognitions, gifts of morn,"
28837,J.R. LOWELL.,"Ere life grow noisy, and slower-footed thought"
28838,J.R. LOWELL.,"Can overtake the rapture of the sense,"
28839,J.R. LOWELL.,"To thrust between ourselves and what we feel,"
28840,J.R. LOWELL.,Have something in them secretly divine.            30
28841,J.R. LOWELL.,"Vainly the eye, once schooled to serve the brain,"
28842,J.R. LOWELL.,With pains deliberate studies to renew
28843,J.R. LOWELL.,The ideal vision: second-thoughts are prose;
28844,J.R. LOWELL.,For beauty's acme hath a term as brief
28845,J.R. LOWELL.,"As the wave's poise before it break in pearl,"
28846,J.R. LOWELL.,"Our own breath dims the mirror of the sense,"
28847,J.R. LOWELL.,Looking too long and closely: at a flash
28848,J.R. LOWELL.,"We snatch the essential grace of meaning out,"
28849,J.R. LOWELL.,"And that first passion beggars all behind,"
28850,J.R. LOWELL.,Heirs of a tamer transport prepossessed.            40
28851,J.R. LOWELL.,"Who, seeing once, has truly seen again"
28852,J.R. LOWELL.,The gray vague of unsympathizing sea
28853,J.R. LOWELL.,That dragged his Fancy from her moorings back
28854,J.R. LOWELL.,"To shores inhospitable of eldest time,"
28855,J.R. LOWELL.,"Till blank foreboding of earth-gendered powers,"
28856,J.R. LOWELL.,"Pitiless seignories in the elements,"
28857,J.R. LOWELL.,"Omnipotences blind that darkling smite,"
28858,J.R. LOWELL.,"Misgave him, and repaganized the world?"
28859,J.R. LOWELL.,"Yet, by some subtler touch of sympathy,"
28860,J.R. LOWELL.,"These primal apprehensions, dimly stirred,          50"
28861,J.R. LOWELL.,Perplex the eye with pictures from within.
28862,J.R. LOWELL.,This hath made poets dream of lives foregone
28863,J.R. LOWELL.,"In worlds fantastical, more fair than ours;"
28864,J.R. LOWELL.,"So Memory cheats us, glimpsing half-revealed."
28865,J.R. LOWELL.,Even as I write she tries her wonted spell
28866,J.R. LOWELL.,In that continuous redbreast boding rain:
28867,J.R. LOWELL.,The bird I hear sings not from yonder elm;
28868,J.R. LOWELL.,But the flown ecstasy my childhood heard
28869,J.R. LOWELL.,"Is vocal in my mind, renewed by him,"
28870,J.R. LOWELL.,Haply made sweeter by the accumulate thrill         60
28871,J.R. LOWELL.,That threads my undivided life and steals
28872,J.R. LOWELL.,A pathos from the years and graves between.
28873,J.R. LOWELL.,
28874,J.R. LOWELL.,"I know not how it is with other men,"
28875,J.R. LOWELL.,"Whom I but guess, deciphering myself;"
28876,J.R. LOWELL.,"For me, once felt is so felt nevermore."
28877,J.R. LOWELL.,The fleeting relish at sensation's brim
28878,J.R. LOWELL.,Had in it the best ferment of the wine.
28879,J.R. LOWELL.,One spring I knew as never any since:
28880,J.R. LOWELL.,All night the surges of the warm southwest
28881,J.R. LOWELL.,"Boomed intermittent through the wallowing elms,       70"
28882,J.R. LOWELL.,"And brought a morning from the Gulf adrift,"
28883,J.R. LOWELL.,"Omnipotent with sunshine, whose quick charm"
28884,J.R. LOWELL.,Startled with crocuses the sullen turf
28885,J.R. LOWELL.,And wiled the bluebird to his whiff of song:
28886,J.R. LOWELL.,"One summer hour abides, what time I perched,"
28887,J.R. LOWELL.,"Dappled with noonday, under simmering leaves,"
28888,J.R. LOWELL.,"And pulled the pulpy oxhearts, while aloof"
28889,J.R. LOWELL.,"An oriole clattered and the robins shrilled,"
28890,J.R. LOWELL.,Denouncing me an alien and a thief:
28891,J.R. LOWELL.,"One morn of autumn lords it o'er the rest,      80"
28892,J.R. LOWELL.,"When in the lane I watched the ash-leaves fall,"
28893,J.R. LOWELL.,"Balancing softly earthward without wind,"
28894,J.R. LOWELL.,Or twirling with directer impulse down
28895,J.R. LOWELL.,"On those fallen yesterday, now barbed with frost,"
28896,J.R. LOWELL.,While I grew pensive with the pensive year:
28897,J.R. LOWELL.,"And once I learned how marvellous winter was,"
28898,J.R. LOWELL.,"When past the fence-rails, downy-gray with rime,"
28899,J.R. LOWELL.,I creaked adventurous o'er the spangled crust
28900,J.R. LOWELL.,That made familiar fields seem far and strange
28901,J.R. LOWELL.,As those stark wastes that whiten endlessly       90
28902,J.R. LOWELL.,"In ghastly solitude about the pole,"
28903,J.R. LOWELL.,And gleam relentless to the unsetting sun:
28904,J.R. LOWELL.,Instant the candid chambers of my brain
28905,J.R. LOWELL.,Were painted with these sovran images;
28906,J.R. LOWELL.,And later visions seem but copies pale
28907,J.R. LOWELL.,"From those unfading frescos of the past,"
28908,J.R. LOWELL.,"Which I, young savage, in my age of flint,"
28909,J.R. LOWELL.,"Gazed at, and dimly felt a power in me"
28910,J.R. LOWELL.,Parted from Nature by the joy in her
28911,J.R. LOWELL.,That doubtfully revealed me to myself.     100
28912,J.R. LOWELL.,Thenceforward I must stand outside the gate;
28913,J.R. LOWELL.,"And paradise was paradise the more,"
28914,J.R. LOWELL.,Known once and barred against satiety.
28915,J.R. LOWELL.,
28916,J.R. LOWELL.,"What we call Nature, all outside ourselves,"
28917,J.R. LOWELL.,"Is but our own conceit of what we see,"
28918,J.R. LOWELL.,Our own reaction upon what we feel;
28919,J.R. LOWELL.,"The world's a woman to our shifting mood,"
28920,J.R. LOWELL.,"Feeling with us, or making due pretence"
28921,J.R. LOWELL.,And therefore we the more persuade ourselves
28922,J.R. LOWELL.,"To make all things our thought's confederates,     110"
28923,J.R. LOWELL.,Conniving with us in whate'er we dream.
28924,J.R. LOWELL.,"So when our Fancy seeks analogies,"
28925,J.R. LOWELL.,"Though she have hidden what she after finds,"
28926,J.R. LOWELL.,She loves to cheat herself with feigned surprise.
28927,J.R. LOWELL.,I find my own complexion everywhere;
28928,J.R. LOWELL.,"No rose, I doubt, was ever, like the first,"
28929,J.R. LOWELL.,"A marvel to the bush it dawned upon,"
28930,J.R. LOWELL.,"The rapture of its life made visible,"
28931,J.R. LOWELL.,"The mystery of its yearning realized,"
28932,J.R. LOWELL.,As the first babe to the first woman born;     120
28933,J.R. LOWELL.,No falcon ever felt delight of wings
28934,J.R. LOWELL.,"As when, an eyas, from the stolid cliff"
28935,J.R. LOWELL.,"Loosing himself, he followed his high heart"
28936,J.R. LOWELL.,"To swim on sunshine, masterless as wind;"
28937,J.R. LOWELL.,And I believe the brown earth takes delight
28938,J.R. LOWELL.,"In the new snowdrop looking back at her,"
28939,J.R. LOWELL.,To think that by some vernal alchemy
28940,J.R. LOWELL.,It could transmute her darkness into pearl;
28941,J.R. LOWELL.,"What is the buxom peony after that,"
28942,J.R. LOWELL.,With its coarse constancy of hoyden blush?     130
28943,J.R. LOWELL.,What the full summer to that wonder new?
28944,J.R. LOWELL.,
28945,J.R. LOWELL.,"But, if in nothing else, in us there is"
28946,J.R. LOWELL.,A sense fastidious hardly reconciled
28947,J.R. LOWELL.,"To the poor makeshifts of life's scenery,"
28948,J.R. LOWELL.,"Where the same slide must double all its parts,"
28949,J.R. LOWELL.,"Shoved in for Tarsus and hitched back for Tyre,"
28950,J.R. LOWELL.,"I blame not in the soul this daintiness,"
28951,J.R. LOWELL.,"Rasher of surfeit than a humming-bird,"
28952,J.R. LOWELL.,In things indifferent by sense purveyed;
28953,J.R. LOWELL.,It argues her an immortality     140
28954,J.R. LOWELL.,"And dateless incomes of experience,"
28955,J.R. LOWELL.,This unthrift housekeeping that will not brook
28956,J.R. LOWELL.,"A dish warmed-over at the feast of life,"
28957,J.R. LOWELL.,"And finds Twice stale, served with whatever sauce."
28958,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor matters much how it may go with me
28959,J.R. LOWELL.,Who dwell in Grub Street and am proud to drudge
28960,J.R. LOWELL.,"Where men, my betters, wet their crust with tears;"
28961,J.R. LOWELL.,"Use can make sweet the peach's shady side,"
28962,J.R. LOWELL.,That only by reflection tastes of sun.
28963,J.R. LOWELL.,
28964,J.R. LOWELL.,"But she, my Princess, who will sometimes deign     150"
28965,J.R. LOWELL.,"My garret to illumine till the walls,"
28966,J.R. LOWELL.,"Narrow and dingy, scrawled with hackneyed thought"
28967,J.R. LOWELL.,"(Poor Richard slowly elbowing Plato out),"
28968,J.R. LOWELL.,Dilate and drape themselves with tapestries
28969,J.R. LOWELL.,"Nausikaa might have stooped o'er, while, between,"
28970,J.R. LOWELL.,"Mirrors, effaced in their own clearness, send"
28971,J.R. LOWELL.,Her only image on through deepening deeps
28972,J.R. LOWELL.,"With endless repercussion of delight,--"
28973,J.R. LOWELL.,"Bringer of life, witching each sense to soul,"
28974,J.R. LOWELL.,That sometimes almost gives me to believe     160
28975,J.R. LOWELL.,"I might have been a poet, gives at least"
28976,J.R. LOWELL.,"A brain dasaxonized, an ear that makes"
28977,J.R. LOWELL.,"Music where none is, and a keener pang"
28978,J.R. LOWELL.,"Of exquisite surmise outleaping thought,--"
28979,J.R. LOWELL.,Her will I pamper in her luxury:
28980,J.R. LOWELL.,No crumpled rose-leaf of too careless choice
28981,J.R. LOWELL.,"Shall bring a northern nightmare to her dreams,"
28982,J.R. LOWELL.,Vexing with sense of exile; hers shall be
28983,J.R. LOWELL.,"The invitiate firstlings of experience,"
28984,J.R. LOWELL.,Vibrations felt but once and felt life long:     170
28985,J.R. LOWELL.,"Oh, more than half-way turn that Grecian front"
28986,J.R. LOWELL.,"Upon me, while with self-rebuke I spell,"
28987,J.R. LOWELL.,On the plain fillet that confines thy hair
28988,J.R. LOWELL.,"In conscious bounds of seeming unconstraint,"
28989,J.R. LOWELL.,"The _Naught in overplus_, thy race's badge!"
28990,J.R. LOWELL.,
28991,J.R. LOWELL.,One feast for her I secretly designed
28992,J.R. LOWELL.,In that Old World so strangely beautiful
28993,J.R. LOWELL.,"To us the disinherited of eld,--"
28994,J.R. LOWELL.,"A day at Chartres, with no soul beside"
28995,J.R. LOWELL.,To roil with pedant prate my joy serene     180
28996,J.R. LOWELL.,And make the minster shy of confidence.
28997,J.R. LOWELL.,"I went, and, with the Saxon's pious care,"
28998,J.R. LOWELL.,"First ordered dinner at the pea-green inn,"
28999,J.R. LOWELL.,The flies and I its only customers.
29000,J.R. LOWELL.,"Eluding these, I loitered through the town,"
29001,J.R. LOWELL.,With hope to take my minster unawares
29002,J.R. LOWELL.,In its grave solitude of memory.
29003,J.R. LOWELL.,"A pretty burgh, and such as Fancy loves"
29004,J.R. LOWELL.,"For bygone grandeurs, faintly rumorous now"
29005,J.R. LOWELL.,"Upon the mind's horizon, as of storm     190"
29006,J.R. LOWELL.,"Brooding its dreamy thunders far aloof,"
29007,J.R. LOWELL.,"That mingle with our mood, but not disturb."
29008,J.R. LOWELL.,"Its once grim bulwarks, tamed to lovers' walks,"
29009,J.R. LOWELL.,"Look down unwatchful on the sliding Eure,"
29010,J.R. LOWELL.,"Whose listless leisure suits the quiet place,"
29011,J.R. LOWELL.,Lisping among his shallows homelike sounds
29012,J.R. LOWELL.,At Concord and by Bankside heard before.
29013,J.R. LOWELL.,"Chance led me to a public pleasure-ground,"
29014,J.R. LOWELL.,"Where I grew kindly with the merry groups,"
29015,J.R. LOWELL.,And blessed the Frenchman for his simple art     200
29016,J.R. LOWELL.,Of being domestic in the light of day.
29017,J.R. LOWELL.,"His language has no word, we growl, for Home;"
29018,J.R. LOWELL.,"But he can find a fireside in the sun,"
29019,J.R. LOWELL.,"Play with his child, make love, and shriek his mind,"
29020,J.R. LOWELL.,By throngs of strangers undisprivacied.
29021,J.R. LOWELL.,"He makes his life a public gallery,"
29022,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor feels himself till what he feels comes back
29023,J.R. LOWELL.,In manifold reflection from without;
29024,J.R. LOWELL.,"While we, each pore alert with consciousness,"
29025,J.R. LOWELL.,"Hide our best selves as we had stolen them,     210"
29026,J.R. LOWELL.,"And each bystander a detective were,"
29027,J.R. LOWELL.,Keen-eyed for every chink of undisguise.
29028,J.R. LOWELL.,
29029,J.R. LOWELL.,"So, musing o'er the problem which was best,--"
29030,J.R. LOWELL.,"A life wide-windowed, shining all abroad,"
29031,J.R. LOWELL.,Or curtains drawn to shield from sight profane
29032,J.R. LOWELL.,"The rites we pay to the mysterious I,--"
29033,J.R. LOWELL.,With outward senses furloughed and head bowed
29034,J.R. LOWELL.,"I followed some fine instinct in my feet,"
29035,J.R. LOWELL.,"Till, to unbend me from the loom of thought,"
29036,J.R. LOWELL.,"Looking up suddenly, I found mine eyes     220"
29037,J.R. LOWELL.,Confronted with the minster's vast repose.
29038,J.R. LOWELL.,Silent and gray as forest-leaguered cliff
29039,J.R. LOWELL.,"Left inland by the ocean's slow retreat,"
29040,J.R. LOWELL.,"That hears afar the breeze-borne rote and longs,"
29041,J.R. LOWELL.,"Remembering shocks of surf that clomb and fell,"
29042,J.R. LOWELL.,"Spume-sliding down the baffled decuman,"
29043,J.R. LOWELL.,"It rose before me, patiently remote"
29044,J.R. LOWELL.,"From the great tides of life it breasted once,"
29045,J.R. LOWELL.,Hearing the noise of men as in a dream.
29046,J.R. LOWELL.,"I stood before the triple northern port,     230"
29047,J.R. LOWELL.,"Where dedicated shapes of saints and kings,"
29048,J.R. LOWELL.,"Stern faces bleared with immemorial watch,"
29049,J.R. LOWELL.,"Looked down benignly grave and seemed to say,"
29050,J.R. LOWELL.,_Ye come and go incessant; we remain
29051,J.R. LOWELL.,Safe in the hallowed quiets of the past;
29052,J.R. LOWELL.,"Be reverent, ye who flit and are forgot,"
29053,J.R. LOWELL.,Of faith so nobly realized as this._
29054,J.R. LOWELL.,I seem to have heard it said by learnèd folk
29055,J.R. LOWELL.,Who drench you with æsthetics till you feel
29056,J.R. LOWELL.,"As if all beauty were a ghastly bore,     240"
29057,J.R. LOWELL.,"The faucet to let loose a wash of words,"
29058,J.R. LOWELL.,"That Gothic is not Grecian, therefore worse;"
29059,J.R. LOWELL.,"But, being convinced by much experiment"

29065,J.R. LOWELL.,"The Grecian gluts me with its perfectness,"
29066,J.R. LOWELL.,"Unanswerable as Euclid, self-contained,     250"
29067,J.R. LOWELL.,"The one thing finished in this hasty world,"
29068,J.R. LOWELL.,"Forever finished, though the barbarous pit,"
29069,J.R. LOWELL.,"Fanatical on hearsay, stamp and shout"
29070,J.R. LOWELL.,As if a miracle could be encored.
29071,J.R. LOWELL.,"But ah! this other, this that never ends,"
29072,J.R. LOWELL.,"Still climbing, luring fancy still to climb,"
29073,J.R. LOWELL.,"As full of morals half-divined as life,"
29074,J.R. LOWELL.,"Graceful, grotesque, with ever new surprise"
29075,J.R. LOWELL.,"Of hazardous caprices sure to please,"
29076,J.R. LOWELL.,"Heavy as nightmare, airy-light as fern,     260"
29077,J.R. LOWELL.,Imagination's very self in stone!
29078,J.R. LOWELL.,With one long sigh of infinite release
29079,J.R. LOWELL.,"From pedantries past, present, or to come,"
29080,J.R. LOWELL.,"I looked, and owned myself a happy Goth."
29081,J.R. LOWELL.,"Your blood is mine, ye architects of dream,"
29082,J.R. LOWELL.,"Builders of aspiration incomplete,"
29083,J.R. LOWELL.,"So more consummate, souls self-confident,"
29084,J.R. LOWELL.,Who felt your own thought worthy of record
29085,J.R. LOWELL.,In monumental pomp! No Grecian drop
29086,J.R. LOWELL.,"Rebukes these veins that leap with kindred thrill,     270"
29087,J.R. LOWELL.,"After long exile, to the mother-tongue."
29088,J.R. LOWELL.,
29089,J.R. LOWELL.,"Ovid in Pontus, puling for his Rome"
29090,J.R. LOWELL.,Of men invirile and disnatured dames
29091,J.R. LOWELL.,"That poison sucked from the Attic bloom decayed,"
29092,J.R. LOWELL.,Shrank with a shudder from the blue-eyed race
29093,J.R. LOWELL.,"Whose force rough-handed should renew the world,"
29094,J.R. LOWELL.,And from the dregs of Romulus express
29095,J.R. LOWELL.,"Such wine as Dante poured, or he who blew"

29104,J.R. LOWELL.,"The carvings touched to meaning new with snow,"
29105,J.R. LOWELL.,Or commented with fleeting grace of shade;
29106,J.R. LOWELL.,"The statues, motley as man's memory,"
29107,J.R. LOWELL.,"Partial as that, so mixed of true and false,        290"
29108,J.R. LOWELL.,History and legend meeting with a kiss
29109,J.R. LOWELL.,Across this bound-mark where their realms confine;
29110,J.R. LOWELL.,"The painted windows, freaking gloom with glow,"
29111,J.R. LOWELL.,"Dusking the sunshine which they seem to cheer,"
29112,J.R. LOWELL.,"Meet symbol of the senses and the soul,"
29113,J.R. LOWELL.,"And the whole pile, grim with the Northman's thought"
29114,J.R. LOWELL.,"Of life and death, and doom, life's equal fee,--"
29115,J.R. LOWELL.,"These were before me: and I gazed abashed,"
29116,J.R. LOWELL.,"Child of an age that lectures, not creates,"
29117,J.R. LOWELL.,"Plastering our swallow-nests on the awful Past,     300"

29124,J.R. LOWELL.,"I entered, reverent of whatever shrine"
29125,J.R. LOWELL.,Guards piety and solace for my kind
29126,J.R. LOWELL.,"Or gives the soul a moment's truce of God,"
29127,J.R. LOWELL.,And shared decorous in the ancient rite             310
29128,J.R. LOWELL.,My sterner fathers held idolatrous.
29129,J.R. LOWELL.,"The service over, I was tranced in thought:"
29130,J.R. LOWELL.,"Solemn the deepening vaults, and most to me,"
29131,J.R. LOWELL.,"Fresh from the fragile realm of deal and paint,"
29132,J.R. LOWELL.,Or brick mock-pious with a marble front;
29133,J.R. LOWELL.,"Solemn the lift of high-embowered roof,"
29134,J.R. LOWELL.,"The clustered stems that spread in boughs disleaved,"
29135,J.R. LOWELL.,"Through which the organ blew a dream of storm,"
29136,J.R. LOWELL.,Though not more potent to sublime with awe
29137,J.R. LOWELL.,"And shut the heart up to tranquillity,               320"
29138,J.R. LOWELL.,Than aisles to me familiar that o'erarch

29140,J.R. LOWELL.,"Centurial shadows, cloisters of the elk:,"
29141,J.R. LOWELL.,"Yet here was sense of undefined regret,"
29142,J.R. LOWELL.,"Irreparable loss, uncertain what:"
29143,J.R. LOWELL.,"Was all this grandeur but anachronism,"
29144,J.R. LOWELL.,"A shell divorced of its informing life,"
29145,J.R. LOWELL.,"Where the priest housed him like a hermit-crab,"
29146,J.R. LOWELL.,An alien to that faith of elder days
29147,J.R. LOWELL.,That gathered round it this fair shape of stone?     330
29148,J.R. LOWELL.,"Is old Religion but a spectre now,"
29149,J.R. LOWELL.,"Haunting the solitude of darkened minds,"
29150,J.R. LOWELL.,Mocked out of memory by the sceptic day?
29151,J.R. LOWELL.,"Is there no corner safe from peeping Doubt,"
29152,J.R. LOWELL.,Since Gutenberg made thought cosmopolite
29153,J.R. LOWELL.,And stretched electric threads from mind to mind?
29154,J.R. LOWELL.,"Nay, did Faith build this wonder? or did Fear,"
29155,J.R. LOWELL.,That makes a fetish and misnames it God
29156,J.R. LOWELL.,"(Blockish or metaphysic, matters not),"

29162,J.R. LOWELL.,"Before some shrine of saintly womanhood,"
29163,J.R. LOWELL.,Bribed intercessor with the far-off Judge:
29164,J.R. LOWELL.,"Such my first thought, by kindlier soon rebuked,"
29165,J.R. LOWELL.,Pleading for whatsoever touches life
29166,J.R. LOWELL.,"With upward impulse: be He nowhere else,"

29178,J.R. LOWELL.,"My lids were moistened as the woman knelt,           360"
29179,J.R. LOWELL.,"And--was it will, or some vibration faint"
29180,J.R. LOWELL.,"Of sacred Nature, deeper than the will?--"
29181,J.R. LOWELL.,"My heart occultly felt itself in hers,"
29182,J.R. LOWELL.,Through mutual intercession gently leagued.
29183,J.R. LOWELL.,
29184,J.R. LOWELL.,Or was it not mere sympathy of brain?
29185,J.R. LOWELL.,A sweetness intellectually conceived
29186,J.R. LOWELL.,In simpler creeds to me impossible?
29187,J.R. LOWELL.,A juggle of that pity for ourselves
29188,J.R. LOWELL.,"In others, which puts on such pretty masks"
29189,J.R. LOWELL.,And snares self-love with bait of charity?          370
29190,J.R. LOWELL.,"Something of all it might be, or of none:"
29191,J.R. LOWELL.,Yet for a moment I was snatched away
29192,J.R. LOWELL.,And had the evidence of things not seen;
29193,J.R. LOWELL.,"For one rapt moment; then it all came back,"
29194,J.R. LOWELL.,"This age that blots out life with question-marks,"
29195,J.R. LOWELL.,This nineteenth century with its knife and glass
29196,J.R. LOWELL.,"That make thought physical, and thrust far off"
29197,J.R. LOWELL.,"The Heaven, so neighborly with man of old,"
29198,J.R. LOWELL.,To voids sparse-sown with alienated stars.

29207,J.R. LOWELL.,"Science was Faith once; Faith were Science now,"
29208,J.R. LOWELL.,Would she but lay her bow and arrows by
29209,J.R. LOWELL.,And arm her with the weapons of the time.

29213,J.R. LOWELL.,Shall we treat Him as if He were a child
29214,J.R. LOWELL.,That knew not his own purpose? nor dare trust
29215,J.R. LOWELL.,"The Rock of Ages to their chemic tests,"
29216,J.R. LOWELL.,Lest some day the all-sustaining base divine
29217,J.R. LOWELL.,"Should fail from under us, dissolved in gas?"

29219,J.R. LOWELL.,In a dry blood-speck between ox and man
29220,J.R. LOWELL.,"Stares helpless at this miracle called life,        400"
29221,J.R. LOWELL.,"This shaping potency behind the egg,"
29222,J.R. LOWELL.,"This circulation swift of deity,"
29223,J.R. LOWELL.,Where suns and systems inconspicuous float
29224,J.R. LOWELL.,As the poor blood-disks in our mortal veins.
29225,J.R. LOWELL.,"Each age must worship its own thought of God,"
29226,J.R. LOWELL.,"More or less earthy, clarifying still"
29227,J.R. LOWELL.,With subsidence continuous of the dregs;
29228,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor saint nor sage could fix immutably
29229,J.R. LOWELL.,"The fluent image of the unstable Best,"
29230,J.R. LOWELL.,Still changing in their very hands that wrought:     410
29231,J.R. LOWELL.,To-day's eternal truth To-morrow proved

29235,J.R. LOWELL.,And Truth locked fast with her own master-key;
29236,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor didst Thou reck what image man might make
29237,J.R. LOWELL.,Of his own shadow on the flowing world;
29238,J.R. LOWELL.,The climbing instinct was enough for Thee.
29239,J.R. LOWELL.,"Or wast Thou, then, an ebbing tide that left"
29240,J.R. LOWELL.,"Strewn with dead miracle those eldest shores,       420"

29243,J.R. LOWELL.,Idle who hopes with prophets to be snatched
29244,J.R. LOWELL.,By virtue in their mantles left below;
29245,J.R. LOWELL.,"Shall the soul live on other men's report,"
29246,J.R. LOWELL.,Herself a pleasing fable of herself?
29247,J.R. LOWELL.,"Man cannot be God's outlaw if he would,"
29248,J.R. LOWELL.,Nor so abscond him in the caves of sense

29263,J.R. LOWELL.,"Or on the hillside, always unforwarned."
29264,J.R. LOWELL.,"A grace of being, finer than himself,"
29265,J.R. LOWELL.,"That beckons and is gone,--a larger life"
29266,J.R. LOWELL.,"Upon his own impinging, with swift glimpse"
29267,J.R. LOWELL.,"Of spacious circles luminous with mind,"
29268,J.R. LOWELL.,To which the ethereal substance of his own

29280,J.R. LOWELL.,"Nor know I which to hold worst enemy,               460"
29281,J.R. LOWELL.,Him who on speculation's windy waste
29282,J.R. LOWELL.,"Would turn me loose, stript of the raiment warm"
29283,J.R. LOWELL.,"By Faith contrived against our nakedness,"

29286,J.R. LOWELL.,"The soul's east-window of divine surprise,"
29287,J.R. LOWELL.,Where others worship I but look and long;

29289,J.R. LOWELL.,"Its forms to me are weariness, and most"
29290,J.R. LOWELL.,"That drony vacuum of compulsory prayer,             470"
29291,J.R. LOWELL.,"Still pumping phrases for the Ineffable,"
29292,J.R. LOWELL.,Though all the valves of memory gasp and wheeze.

29317,J.R. LOWELL.,Hath dared the contradiction ludicrous
29318,J.R. LOWELL.,Of supernatural in modern clothes.
29319,J.R. LOWELL.,Perhaps the deeper faith that is to come
29320,J.R. LOWELL.,"Will see God rather in the strenuous doubt,"
29321,J.R. LOWELL.,Than in the creed held as an infant's hand     500

29323,J.R. LOWELL.,
29324,J.R. LOWELL.,"Say it is drift, not progress, none the less,"

29341,J.R. LOWELL.,And o'er their claret settle Comte unread.
29342,J.R. LOWELL.,Fagot and stake were desperately sincere:     520

29702,I,Making music before her feet?
29703,I,Her presence freshens the air;

29772,IV,"Oh, call them rather chrisms than stains,"
29773,IV,Sacred and from heroic veins!
29774,IV,"For, in the glory-guarded pass,"
29775,IV,Her haughty and far-shining head
29776,IV,She bowed to shrive Leonidas
29777,IV,With his imperishable dead;
29778,IV,"Her, too, Morgarten saw,"
29779,IV,Where the Swiss lion fleshed his icy paw;
29780,IV,She followed Cromwell's quenchless star      70
29781,IV,Where the grim Puritan tread
29782,IV,"Shook Marston, Naseby, and Dunbar:"
29783,IV,"Yea, on her feet are dearer dyes"

29789,V,Our fathers found her in the woods
29790,V,"Where Nature meditates and broods,"
29791,V,The seeds of unexampled things
29792,V,Which Time to consummation brings
29793,V,Through life and death and man's unstable moods;
29794,V,"They met her here, not recognized,               80"
29795,V,"A sylvan huntress clothed in furs,"
29796,V,"To whose chaste wants her bow sufficed,"
29797,V,Nor dreamed what destinies were hers:
29798,V,She taught them bee-like to create
29799,V,Their simpler forms of Church and State;
29800,V,She taught them to endue
29801,V,"The past with other functions than it knew,"
29802,V,And turn in channels strange the uncertain stream of Fate;
29803,V,"Better than all, she fenced them in their need"
29804,V,"With iron-handed Duty's sternest creed,           90"

29811,VI,To this low village of the plain
29812,VI,"Far from the Present's loud highway,"
29813,VI,From Trade's cool heart and seething brain?
29814,VI,Why cometh she? She was not far away.
29815,VI,"Since the soul touched it, not in vain,"
29816,VI,"With pathos of Immortal gain,"
29817,VI,'Tis here her fondest memories stay.
29818,VI,She loves yon pine-bemurmured ridge             100
29819,VI,"Where now our broad-browed poet sleeps,"
29820,VI,Dear to both Englands; near him he
29821,VI,Who wore the ring of Canace;
29822,VI,But most her heart to rapture leaps
29823,VI,"Where stood that era-parting bridge,"
29824,VI,"O'er which, with footfall still as dew,"
29825,VI,The Old Time passed into the New;
29826,VI,"Where, as your stealthy river creeps,"
29827,VI,He whispers to his listening weeds
29828,VI,Tales of sublimest homespun deeds.              110
29829,VI,Here English law and English thought
29830,VI,'Gainst the self-will of England fought;
29831,VI,"And here were men (coequal with their fate),"
29832,VI,"Who did great things, unconscious they were great."
29833,VI,They dreamed not what a die was cast
29834,VI,With that first answering shot; what then?
29835,VI,There was their duty; they were men
29836,VI,"Schooled the soul's inward gospel to obey,"
29837,VI,Though leading to the lion's den.
29838,VI,They felt the habit-hallowed world give way     120
29839,VI,"Beneath their lives, and on went they,"
29840,VI,Unhappy who was last.
29841,VI,"When Buttrick gave the word,"
29842,VI,"That awful idol of the unchallenged Past,"
29843,VI,"Strong in their love, and in their lineage strong,"
29844,VI,"Fell crashing; if they heard it not,"
29845,VI,"Yet the earth heard,"
29846,VI,"Nor ever hath forgot,"
29847,VI,"As on from startled throne to throne,"
29848,VI,"Where Superstition sate or conscious Wrong,      130"
29849,VI,A shudder ran of some dread birth unknown.
29850,VI,Thrice venerable spot!
29851,VI,River more fateful than the Rubicon!
29852,VI,"O'er those red planks, to snatch her diadem,"
29853,VI,"Man's Hope, star-girdled, sprang with them,"
29854,VI,And over ways untried the feet of Doom strode on.

29859,VII,Think you these felt no charms
29860,VII,In their gray homesteads and embowered farms?
29861,VII,In household faces waiting at the door
29862,VII,Their evening step should lighten up no more?     140
29863,VII,In fields their boyish feet had known?
29864,VII,"In trees their fathers' hands had set,"
29865,VII,"And which with them had grown,"
29866,VII,Widening each year their leafy coronet?
29867,VII,Felt they no pang of passionate regret
29868,VII,For those unsolid goods that seem so much our own?
29869,VII,"These things are dear to every man that lives,"
29870,VII,And life prized more for what it lends than gives.
29871,VII,"Yea, many a tie, through iteration sweet,"
29872,VII,Strove to detain their fatal feet;
29873,VII,"And yet the enduring half they chose,      151"
29874,VII,"Whose choice decides a man life's slave or king,"
29875,VII,The invisible things of God before the seen and known:
29876,VII,Therefore their memory inspiration blows
29877,VII,With echoes gathering on from zone to zone;
29878,VII,For manhood is the one immortal thing
29879,VII,"Beneath Time's changeful sky,"
29880,VII,"And, where it lightened once, from age to age,"
29881,VII,"Men come to learn, in grateful pilgrimage,"
29882,VII,That length of days is knowing when to die.      160

29888,VIII,"She, a world-wandering orphan then,"
29889,VIII,So mighty now! Those are her streams
29890,VIII,"That whirl the myriad, myriad wheels"
29891,VIII,"Of all that does, and all that dreams,"
29892,VIII,"Of all that thinks, and all that feels,"
29893,VIII,Through spaces stretched from sea to sea;
29894,VIII,"By idle tongues and busy brains,"
29895,VIII,"By who doth right, and who refrains,"
29896,VIII,Here are our losses and our gains;            170

29904,IX,Our hearts were filled with pride's tumultuous wine;
29905,IX,Better to-day who rather feels than thinks.
29906,IX,"Yet will some graver thoughts intrude,"
29907,IX,And cares of sterner mood;
29908,IX,They won thee: who shall keep thee? From the deeps
29909,IX,"Where discrowned empires o'er their ruins brood,              179"
29910,IX,"And many a thwarted hope wrings its weak hands and weeps,"
29911,IX,I hear the voice as of a mighty wind
29912,IX,"From all heaven's caverns rushing unconfined,"
29913,IX,"'I, Freedom, dwell with Knowledge: I abide"
29914,IX,With men whom dust of faction cannot blind
29915,IX,To the slow tracings of the Eternal Mind;
29916,IX,"With men by culture trained and fortified,"
29917,IX,"Who bitter duty to sweet lusts prefer,"
29918,IX,Fearless to counsel and obey.
29919,IX,"Conscience my sceptre is, and law my sword,"
29920,IX,"Not to be drawn in passion or in play,                     190"
29921,IX,But terrible to punish and deter;
29922,IX,"Implacable as God's word,"
29923,IX,"Like it, a shepherd's crook to them that blindly err."
29924,IX,"Your firm-pulsed sires, my martyrs and my saints,"
29925,IX,Offshoots of that one stock whose patient sense
29926,IX,"Hath known to mingle flux with permanence,"
29927,IX,Rated my chaste denials and restraints
29928,IX,Above the moment's dear-paid paradise:
29929,IX,"Beware lest, shifting with Time's gradual creep,"
29930,IX,The light that guided shine into your eyes.      200
29931,IX,The envious Powers of ill nor wink nor sleep;
29932,IX,"Be therefore timely wise,"
29933,IX,"Nor laugh when this one steals, and that one lies,"
29934,IX,"As if your luck could cheat those sleepless spies,"
29935,IX,Till the deaf Fury comes your house to sweep!'
29936,IX,"I hear the voice, and unaffrighted bow;"
29937,IX,"Ye shall not be prophetic now,"
29938,IX,"Heralds of ill, that darkening fly"
29939,IX,"Between my vision and the rainbowed sky,"
29940,IX,Or on the left your hoarse forebodings croak      210
29941,IX,From many a blasted bough
29942,IX,"On Yggdrasil's storm-sinewed oak,"
29943,IX,"That once was green, Hope of the West, as thou;"
29944,IX,Yet pardon if I tremble while I boast;

30041,II,"Leaves in the soil its unextinguished trace,"
30042,II,"Pungent, pathetic, sad with nobler aims,"

30075,II,"Of one fair bough, inseparably wrought"
30076,II,Into the seamless tapestry of thought.
30077,II,"So charmed, with undeluded eye we see"
30078,II,In history's fragmentary tale
30079,II,"Bright clues of continuity,"
30080,II,"Learn that high natures over Time prevail,"

30089,III,Beneath our consecrated elm
30090,III,"A century ago he stood,"
30091,III,Famed vaguely for that old fight in the wood
30092,III,"Whose red surge sought, but could not overwhelm"
30093,III,The life foredoomed to wield our rough-hewn helm:--
30094,III,"From colleges, where now the gown"
30095,III,"To arms had yielded, from the town,"
30096,III,Our rude self-summoned levies flocked to see
30097,III,The new-come chiefs and wonder which was he.
30098,III,"No need to question long; close-lipped and tall,      80"
30099,III,Long trained in murder-brooding forests lone
30100,III,"To bridle others' clamors and his own,"
30101,III,"Firmly erect, he towered above them all,"
30102,III,The incarnate discipline that was to free
30103,III,With iron curb that armed democracy.

30105,III,2.
30106,III,
30107,III,"A motley rout was that which came to stare,"
30108,III,"In raiment tanned by years of sun and storm,"
30109,III,"Of every shape that was not uniform,"
30110,III,Dotted with regimentals here and there;
30111,III,"An array all of captains, used to pray            90"
30112,III,"And stiff in fight, but serious drill's despair,"
30113,III,"Skilled to debate their orders, not obey;"
30114,III,"Deacons were there, selectmen, men of note"
30115,III,"In half-tamed hamlets ambushed round with woods,"
30116,III,"Ready to settle Freewill by a vote,"
30117,III,But largely liberal to its private moods;
30118,III,"Prompt to assert by manners, voice, or pen,"
30119,III,"Or ruder arms, their rights as Englishmen,"
30120,III,Nor much fastidious as to how and when:
30121,III,Yet seasoned stuff and fittest to create         100
30122,III,A thought-staid army or a lasting state:
30123,III,"Haughty they said he was, at first; severe;"
30124,III,"But owned, as all men own, the steady hand"
30125,III,"Upon the bridle, patient to command,"
30126,III,"Prized, as all prize, the justice pure from fear,"
30127,III,"And learned to honor first, then love him, then revere."
30128,III,Such power there is in clear-eyed self-restraint
30129,III,And purpose clean as light from every selfish taint.

30135,III,"The sun-flecks, shaken the stirred foliage through,"
30136,III,Dapple with gold his sober buff and blue
30137,III,And weave prophetic aureoles round the head
30138,III,That shines our beacon now nor darkens with the dead.
30139,III,"O man of silent mood,"
30140,III,"A stranger among strangers then,"
30141,III,"How art thou since renowned the Great, the Good,"
30142,III,Familiar as the day in an the homes of men!
30143,III,"The winged years, that winnow praise and blame,"

30163,IV,"Mountain and river, forest, prairie, sea,"

30180,IV,"Welded by hammer-strokes of broad-brained kings,"

30182,IV,Of wise traditions widening cautious rings;
30183,IV,"At best they are computable things,      150"
30184,IV,A strength behind us making us feel bold
30185,IV,"In right, or, as may chance, in wrong;"
30186,IV,"Whose force by figures may be summed and told,"
30187,IV,"So many soldiers, ships, and dollars strong,"
30188,IV,And we but drops that bear compulsory part
30189,IV,In the dumb throb of a mechanic heart;
30190,IV,But Country is a shape of each man's mind
30191,IV,"Sacred from definition, unconfined"
30192,IV,By the cramped walls where daily drudgeries grind;
30193,IV,"An inward vision, yet an outward birth               160"
30194,IV,Of sweet familiar heaven and earth;
30195,IV,A brooding Presence that stirs motions blind
30196,IV,Of wings within our embryo being's shell
30197,IV,That wait but her completer spell
30198,IV,"To make us eagle-natured, fit to dare"
30199,IV,Life's nobler spaces and untarnished air.

30206,IV,Who lifts our lives away from Thine and Mine         170
30207,IV,And feeds the lamp of manhood more divine
30208,IV,With fragrant oils of quenchless constancy.
30209,IV,"When all have done their utmost, surely he"
30210,IV,Hath given the best who gives a character
30211,IV,"Erect and constant, which nor any shock"
30212,IV,"Of loosened elements, nor the forceful sea"
30213,IV,"Of flowing or of ebbing fates, can stir"

30226,IV,Transfuse our mortal will nor are gainsaid:
30227,IV,"These are their arsenals, these the exhaustless mines"
30228,IV,That give a constant heart in great designs;
30229,IV,These are the stuff whereof such dreams are made     190
30230,IV,As make heroic men: thus surely he
30231,IV,Still holds in place the massy blocks he laid
30232,IV,"'Neath our new frame, enforcing soberly"

30247,V,"Who, mortal among mortals, seemed as now"

30257,V,Modelled on classic lines so simple they endure?
30258,V,That soul so softly radiant and so white     210
30259,V,"The track it left seems less of fire than light,"
30260,V,Cold but to such as love distemperature?
30261,V,"And if pure light, as some deem, be the force"
30262,V,"That drives rejoicing planets on their course,"
30263,V,Why for his power benign seek an impurer source?

30265,V,"Domestically bright,"
30266,V,"Fed from itself and shy of human sight,"
30267,V,"The hidden force that makes a lifetime strong,"

30270,V,"But to sublime our natures and control,"
30271,V,"To front heroic toils with late return,"

30275,V,"Unpraised of men who after bonfires run,"
30276,V,"Through seven slow years of unadvancing war,"

30278,V,"With breath of popular applause or blame,     230"

30292,V,"Modest, yet firm as Nature's self; unblamed"

30315,V,"In perfect symmetry of self-control,"
30316,V,"Seems not so great at first, but greater grows"
30317,V,"Still as we look, and by experience learn"
30318,V,"How grand this quiet is, how nobly stern"

30324,V,"A nature too decorous and severe,"

30328,V,"That its grave depths seem obvious and near,"
30329,V,Nor a soul great that made so little noise.
30330,V,"They feel no force in that calm-cadenced phrase,"
30331,V,"The habitual full-dress of his well-bred mind,"
30332,V,That seems to pace the minuet's courtly maze

30354,VI,"Steadfast and still, nor paid with mortal praise,"
30355,VI,But finding amplest recompense
30356,VI,For life's ungarlanded expense
30357,VI,In work done squarely and unwasted days.
30358,VI,"For this we honor him, that he could know"

30380,VII,Unsheathed the sword whose fatal flash
30381,VII,Shot union through the incoherent clash
30382,VII,"Of our loose atoms, crystallizing them              310"
30383,VII,"Around a single will's unpliant stem,"

30396,VII,"When this New World awoke to man's estate,"
30397,VII,Burnt its last ship and ceased to look behind:
30398,VII,Nor thoughtless was the choice; no love or hate
30399,VII,"Could from its poise move that deliberate mind,"
30400,VII,"Weighing between too early and too late,"
30401,VII,Those pitfalls of the man refused by Fate:
30402,VII,His was the impartial vision of the great
30403,VII,"Who see not as they wish, but as they find."
30404,VII,"He saw the dangers of defeat, nor less"
30405,VII,The incomputable perils of success;                 330
30406,VII,"The sacred past thrown by, an empty rind;"
30407,VII,"The future, cloud-land, snare of prophets blind;"

30416,VII,
30417,VII,A noble choice and of immortal seed!

30419,VII,Or easy were as in a boy's romance;
30420,VII,The man's whole life preludes the single deed

30424,VII,Or with the unmotived herd that only sleep and feed.
30425,VII,"Choice seems a thing indifferent: thus or so,"
30426,VII,What matters it? The Fates with mocking face
30427,VII,"Look on inexorable, nor seem to know"
30428,VII,Where the lot lurks that gives life's foremost place.      350
30429,VII,"Yet Duty's leaden casket holds it still,"
30430,VII,"And but two ways are offered to our will,"
30431,VII,"Toil with rare triumph, ease with safe disgrace,"
30432,VII,The problem still for us and all of human race.
30433,VII,"He chose, as men choose, where most danger showed,"
30434,VII,Nor ever faltered 'neath the load
30435,VII,"Of petty cares, that gall great hearts the most,"

30439,VII,"Wasted its wind-borne spray,"

30449,VIII,Which into grander forms our mortal metal ran;
30450,VIII,She gave us this unblemished gentleman:
30451,VIII,What shall we give her back but love and praise
30452,VIII,As in the dear old unestrangèd days                 370
30453,VIII,Before the inevitable wrong began?
30454,VIII,"Mother of States and undiminished men,"
30455,VIII,"Thou gavest us a country, giving him,"

30457,VIII,The boon thou wouldst have snatched from us agen
30458,VIII,"Shines as before with no abatement dim,"
30459,VIII,A great man's memory is the only thing
30460,VIII,With influence to outlast the present whim
30461,VIII,And bind us as when here he knit our golden ring.
30462,VIII,All of him that was subject to the hours            380
30463,VIII,Lies in thy soil and makes it part of ours:
30464,VIII,"Across more recent graves,"
30465,VIII,Where unresentful Nature waves
30466,VIII,"Her pennons o'er the shot-ploughed sod,"
30467,VIII,"Proclaiming the sweet Truce of God,"
30468,VIII,We from this consecrated plain stretch out
30469,VIII,Our hands as free from afterthought or doubt
30470,VIII,As here the united North
30471,VIII,Poured her embrownèd manhood forth
30472,VIII,In welcome of our savior and thy son.               390
30473,VIII,"Through battle we have better learned thy worth,"
30474,VIII,"The long-breathed valor and undaunted will,"
30475,VIII,"Which, like his own, the day's disaster done,"

30477,VIII,Both thine and ours the victory hardly won;
30478,VIII,If ever with distempered voice or pen
30479,VIII,"We have misdeemed thee, here we take it back,"
30480,VIII,And for the dead of both don common black.

30496,I,
30497,I,Entranced I saw a vision in the cloud
30498,I,"That loitered dreaming in yon sunset sky,"
30499,I,"Full of fair shapes, half creatures of the eye,"
30500,I,Half chance-evoked by the wind's fantasy
30501,I,"In golden mist, an ever-shifting crowd:"
30502,I,"There, 'mid unreal forms that came and went"
30503,I,"In air-spun robes, of evanescent dye,"
30504,I,A woman's semblance shone preeminent;
30505,I,"Not armed like Pallas, not like Hera proud,"
30506,I,"But, as on household diligence intent,                  10"
30507,I,Beside her visionary wheel she bent
30508,I,"Like Aretë or Bertha, nor than they"
30509,I,Less queenly in her port; about her knee
30510,I,Glad children clustered confident in play:
30511,I,"Placid her pose, the calm of energy;"
30512,I,And over her broad brow in many a round
30513,I,"(That loosened would have gilt her garment's hem),"
30514,I,"Succinct, as toil prescribes, the hair was wound"
30515,I,"In lustrous coils, a natural diadem."
30516,I,"The cloud changed shape, obsequious to the whim             20"
30517,I,"Of some transmuting influence felt in me,"
30518,I,"And, looking now, a wolf I seemed to see"
30519,I,"Limned in that vapor, gaunt and hunger-bold,"
30520,I,"Threatening her charge; resolve in every limb,"
30521,I,"Erect she flamed in mail of sun-wove gold,"
30522,I,Penthesilea's self for battle dight;
30523,I,"One arm uplifted braced a flickering spear,"
30524,I,And one her adamantine shield made light;
30525,I,"Her face, helm-shadowed, grew a thing to fear,"
30526,I,"And her fierce eyes, by danger challenged, took           30"
30527,I,Her trident-sceptred mother's dauntless look.
30528,I,"'I know thee now, O goddess-born!' I cried,"
30529,I,And turned with loftier brow and firmer stride;
30530,I,For in that spectral cloud-work I had seen
30531,I,"Her image, bodied forth by love and pride,"
30532,I,"The fearless, the benign, the mother-eyed,"
30533,I,The fairer world's toil-consecrated queen.

30539,I,"No blood in vengeance spilt, though lawful, stains?           40"
30540,I,Who never turned a suppliant from her door?
30541,I,Whose conquests are the gains of all mankind?
30542,I,"To-day her thanks shall fly on every wind,"
30543,I,"Unstinted, unrebuked, from shore to shore,"
30544,I,"One love, one hope, and not a doubt behind!"
30545,I,"Cannon to cannon shall repeat her praise,"
30546,I,Banner to banner flap it forth in flame;
30547,I,"Her children shall rise up to bless her name,"
30548,I,"And wish her harmless length of days,"
30549,I,"The mighty mother of a mighty brood,                   50"

30558,I,Of their uncontainable lightning;
30559,I,Seven years long heard the sea
30560,I,Crash of navies and wave-borne thunder;
30561,I,"Then drifted the cloud-rack a-lee,"
30562,I,"And new stars were seen, a world's wonder;                60"
30563,I,"Each by her sisters made bright,"
30564,I,"All binding all to their stations,"
30565,I,Cluster of manifold light
30566,I,Startling the old constellations:
30567,I,Men looked up and grew pale:
30568,I,"Was it a comet or star,"
30569,I,Omen of blessing or bale.

30576,I,"She, the last ripeness of earth,"
30577,I,"Beautiful, prophesied long?"
30578,I,Stormy the days of her prime:
30579,I,Hers are the pulses that beat
30580,I,"Higher for perils sublime,"
30581,I,Making them fawn at her feet.
30582,I,Was she not born of the strong?
30583,I,Was she not born of the wise?
30584,I,Daring and counsel belong
30585,I,Of right to her confident eyes:
30586,I,"Human and motherly they,                             81"
30587,I,Careless of station or race:

30598,II,No broken arch that ministers
30599,II,To Time's sad instinct in the breast;
30600,II,She has not gathered from the years
30601,II,"Grandeur of tragedies and tears,                   90"
30602,II,Nor from long leisure the unrest
30603,II,That finds repose in forms of classic grace:
30604,II,These may delight the coming race
30605,II,Who haply shall not count it to our crime
30606,II,That we who fain would sing are here before our time.
30607,II,She also hath her monuments;
30608,II,Not such as stand decrepitly resigned
30609,II,To ruin-mark the path of dead events
30610,II,"That left no seed of better days behind,"
30611,II,The tourist's pensioners that show their scars           100
30612,II,And maunder of forgotten wars;
30613,II,"She builds not on the ground, but in the mind,"
30614,II,Her open-hearted palaces
30615,II,For larger-thoughted men with heaven and earth at ease:
30616,II,"Her march the plump mow marks, the sleepless wheel,"
30617,II,"The golden sheaf, the self-swayed commonweal;"
30618,II,The happy homesteads hid in orchard trees
30619,II,Whose sacrificial smokes through peaceful air
30620,II,"Rise lost in heaven, the household's silent prayer;"
30621,II,What architect hath bettered these?                     110
30622,II,With softened eye the westward traveller sees
30623,II,"A thousand miles of neighbors side by side,"
30624,II,Holding by toil-won titles fresh from God
30625,II,"The lands no serf or seigneur ever trod,"
30626,II,"With manhood latent in the very sod,"
30627,II,Where the long billow of the wheatfield's tide
30628,II,"Flows to the sky across the prairie wide,"
30629,II,"A sweeter vision than the castled Rhine,"
30630,II,Kindly with thoughts of Ruth and Bible-days benign.

30634,II,"O ancient commonwealths, that we revere                 120"
30635,II,"Haply because we could not know you near,"
30636,II,Your deeds like statues down the aisles of Time
30637,II,"Shine peerless in memorial calm sublime,"
30638,II,"And Athens is a trumpet still, and Rome;"
30639,II,Yet which of your achievements is not foam
30640,II,Weighed with this one of hers (below you far
30641,II,"In fame, and born beneath a milder star),"
30642,II,"That to Earth's orphans, far as curves the dome"
30643,II,"Of death-deaf sky, the bounteous West means home,"
30644,II,With dear precedency of natural ties                    130
30645,II,That stretch from roof to roof and make men gently wise?
30646,II,"And if the nobler passions wane,"
30647,II,"Distorted to base use, if the near goal"
30648,II,Of insubstantial gain
30649,II,Tempt from the proper race-course of the soul
30650,II,That crowns their patient breath
30651,II,"Whose feet, song-sandalled, are too fleet for Death,"
30652,II,Yet may she claim one privilege urbane
30653,II,"And haply first upon the civic roll,"
30654,II,That none can breathe her air nor grow humane.           140

30657,II,
30658,II,"Oh, better far the briefest hour"
30659,II,"Of Athens self-consumed, whose plastic power"
30660,II,Hid Beauty safe from Death in words or stone;
30661,II,"Of Rome, fair quarry where those eagles crowd"
30662,II,Whose fulgurous vans about the world had blown
30663,II,Triumphant storm and seeds of polity;
30664,II,"Of Venice, fading o'er her shipless sea,"
30665,II,Last iridescence of a sunset cloud;
30666,II,"Than this inert prosperity,"
30667,II,This bovine comfort in the sense alone!                  150
30668,II,Yet art came slowly even to such as those.
30669,II,Whom no past genius cheated of their own
30670,II,With prudence of o'ermastering precedent;
30671,II,"Petal by petal spreads the perfect rose,"
30672,II,Secure of the divine event;
30673,II,And only children rend the bud half-blown
30674,II,To forestall Nature in her calm intent:
30675,II,Time hath a quiver full of purposes
30676,II,"Which miss not of their aim, to us unknown,"
30677,II,And brings about the impossible with ease:           160
30678,II,Haply for us the ideal dawn shall break
30679,II,From where in legend-tinted line
30680,II,"The peaks of Hellas drink the morning's wine,"
30681,II,To tremble on our lids with mystic sign
30682,II,Till the drowsed ichor in our veins awake
30683,II,And set our pulse in time with moods divine:
30684,II,"Long the day lingered in its sea-fringed nest,"
30685,II,Then touched the Tuscan hills with golden lance
30686,II,And paused; then on to Spain and France
30687,II,"The splendor flew, and Albion's misty crest:     170"
30688,II,Shall Ocean bar him from his destined West?
30689,II,"Or are we, then, arrived too late,"
30690,II,"Doomed with the rest to grope disconsolate,"
30691,II,Foreclosed of Beauty by our modern date?

30721,III,Murmur of many voices in the air
30722,III,"Denounces us degenerate,"

30726,III,"Where wisdom and not numbers should have weight,     200"
30727,III,"Seed-field of simpler manners, braver truth,"
30728,III,Where shams should cease to dominate

30730,III,"Is this Atlantis? This the unpoisoned soil,"
30731,III,"Sea-whelmed for ages and recovered late,"
30732,III,Where parasitic greed no more should coil
30733,III,Bound Freedom's stem to bend awry and blight
30734,III,"What grew so fair, sole plant of love and light?"
30735,III,Who sit where once in crowned seclusion sate
30736,III,The long-proved athletes of debate    210
30737,III,"Trained from their youth, as none thinks needful now?"
30738,III,"Is this debating club where boys dispute,"
30739,III,"And wrangle o'er their stolen fruit,"
30740,III,"The Senate, erewhile cloister of the few,"

30749,III,"So would some light, not reason's sharp-edged ray,     220"
30750,III,Trance me in moonshine as before the flight
30751,III,Of years had won me this unwelcome right
30752,III,"To see things as they are, or shall he soon,"

30761,III,The golden age is still the age that's past:

30763,III,To dull my vision of that only state
30764,III,"Founded on faith in man, and therefore sure to last."
30765,III,"For, O my country, touched by thee,"

30787,IV,Steered for the Unknown which gods to mortals gave.
30788,IV,"Of thought and action the mysterious door,     250"
30789,IV,"Bugbear of fools, a summons to the brave:"
30790,IV,"Strength found he in the unsympathizing sun,"

30792,IV,And the dumb ocean pitilessly grave:
30793,IV,High-hearted surely he;

30795,IV,Their moorings from the habitable Past

30797,IV,Of storm-engendering Liberty:
30798,IV,"For all earth's width of waters is a span,     260"
30799,IV,"And their convulsed existence mere repose,"

30801,IV,"Shoreless in wants, mist-girt in all it knows,"
30802,IV,"Open to every wind of sect or clan,"

30810,IV,The undaunted few
30811,IV,"Who changed the Old World for the New,     270"
30812,IV,And more devoutly prized
30813,IV,Than all perfection theorized
30814,IV,The more imperfect that had roots and grew.
30815,IV,"They founded deep and well,"
30816,IV,Those danger-chosen chiefs of men
30817,IV,"Who still believed in Heaven and Hell,"
30818,IV,"Nor hoped to find a spell,"
30819,IV,"In some fine flourish of a pen,"
30820,IV,To make a better man
30821,IV,"Than long-considering Nature will or can,           280"
30822,IV,"Secure against his own mistakes,"
30823,IV,"Content with what life gives or takes,"
30824,IV,"And acting still on some fore-ordered plan,"
30825,IV,"A cog of iron in an iron wheel,"
30826,IV,"Too nicely poised to think or feel,"
30827,IV,Dumb motor in a clock-like commonweal.
30828,IV,They wasted not their brain in schemes
30829,IV,"Of what man might be in some bubble-sphere,"
30830,IV,As if he must be other than he seems
30831,IV,"Because he was not what he should be here,          290"
30832,IV,Postponing Time's slow proof to petulant dreams:
30833,IV,Yet herein they were great
30834,IV,"Beyond the incredulous lawgivers of yore,"
30835,IV,"And wiser than the wisdom of the shelf,"
30836,IV,"That they conceived a deeper-rooted state,"
30837,IV,"Of hardier growth, alive from rind to core,"

30887,I,Space's blue walls are mined; we feel the throe
30888,I,From underground of our night-mantled foe:           10
30889,I,The flame-winged feet
30890,I,"Of Trade's new Mercury, that dry-shod run"
30891,I,"Through briny abysses dreamless of the sun,"
30892,I,"Are mercilessly fleet,"
30893,I,And at a bound annihilate
30894,I,Ocean's prerogative of short reprieve;
30895,I,"Surely ill news might wait,"
30896,I,And man be patient of delay to grieve:
30897,I,Letters have sympathies
30898,I,"And tell-tale faces that reveal,                20"
30899,I,To senses finer than the eyes.
30900,I,Their errand's purport ere we break the seal;
30901,I,They wind a sorrow round with circumstance
30902,I,"To stay its feet, nor all unwarned displace"
30903,I,The veil that darkened from our sidelong glance
30904,I,The inexorable face:
30905,I,But now Fate stuns as with a mace;
30906,I,"The savage of the skies, that men have caught"
30907,I,"And some scant use of language taught,"
30908,I,"Tells only what he must,--                 30"
30909,I,The steel-cold fact in one laconic thrust.
30910,I,
30911,I,2.
30912,I,
30913,I,"So thought I, as, with vague, mechanic eyes,"
30914,I,I scanned the festering news we half despise
30915,I,"Yet scramble for no less,"
30916,I,"And read of public scandal, private fraud,"
30917,I,"Crime flaunting scot-free while the mob applaud,"
30918,I,"Office made vile to bribe unworthiness,"
30919,I,And all the unwholesome mess
30920,I,The Land of Honest Abraham serves of late
30921,I,"To teach the Old World how to wait,             40"
30922,I,"When suddenly,"
30923,I,"As happens if the brain, from overweight"
30924,I,"Of blood, infect the eye,"
30925,I,"Three tiny words grew lurid as I read,"
30926,I,And reeled commingling: _Agassiz is dead_.
30927,I,"As when, beneath the street's familiar jar,"
30928,I,"An earthquake's alien omen rumbles far,"
30929,I,"Men listen and forebode, I hung my head,"
30930,I,"And strove the present to recall,"
30931,I,As if the blow that stunned were yet to fall.     50
30932,I,
30933,I,3.
30934,I,
30935,I,"Uprooted is our mountain oak,"
30936,I,That promised long security of shade
30937,I,And brooding-place for many a wingèd thought;
30938,I,Not by Time's softly cadenced stroke
30939,I,"With pauses of relenting pity stayed,"
30940,I,"But ere a root seemed sapt, a bough decayed,"
30941,I,From sudden ambush by the whirlwind caught
30942,I,And in his broad maturity betrayed!
30943,I,
30944,I,4.
30945,I,
30946,I,"Well might I, as of old, appeal to you,"
30947,I,"O mountains, woods, and streams,     60"
30948,I,"To help us mourn him, for ye loved him too;"
30949,I,"But simpler moods befit our modern themes,"
30950,I,"And no less perfect birth of nature can,"
30951,I,"Though they yearn tow'rd him, sympathize with man."
30952,I,Save as dumb fellow-prisoners through a wall;
30953,I,"Answer ye rather to my call,"
30954,I,"Strong poets of a more unconscious day,"
30955,I,"When Nature spake nor sought nice reasons why,"
30956,I,Too much for softer arts forgotten since
30957,I,"That teach our forthright tongue to lisp and mince,     70"
30958,I,And drown in music the heart's bitter cry!
30959,I,"Lead me some steps in your directer way,"
30960,I,Teach me those words that strike a solid root
30961,I,Within the ears of men;
30962,I,"Ye chiefly, virile both to think and feel,"
30963,I,"Deep-chested Chapman and firm-footed Ben,"
30964,I,For he was masculine from head to heel.
30965,I,"Nay, let himself stand undiminished by"
30966,I,With those clear parts of him that will not die.
30967,I,Himself from out the recent dark I claim     80
30968,I,"To hear, and, if I flatter him, to blame;"
30969,I,"To show himself, as still I seem to see,"
30970,I,"A mortal, built upon the antique plan,"
30971,I,"Brimful of lusty blood as ever ran,"
30972,I,And taking life as simply as a tree!
30973,I,"To claim my foiled good-by let him appear,"
30974,I,"Large-limbed and human as I saw him near,"
30975,I,Loosed from the stiffening uniform of fame:
30976,I,"And let me treat him largely; I should fear,"
30977,I,"(If with too prying lens I chanced to err,     90"
30978,I,"Mistaking catalogue for character,)"
30979,I,His wise forefinger raised in smiling blame.
30980,I,Nor would I scant him with judicial breath
30981,I,And turn mere critic in an epitaph;
30982,I,"I choose the wheat, incurious of the chaff"
30983,I,"That swells fame living, chokes it after death,"
30984,I,And would but memorize the shining half
30985,I,Of his large nature that was turned to me:
30986,I,Fain had I joined with those that honored him
30987,I,"With eyes that darkened because his were dim,     100"
30988,I,And now been silent: but it might not be.
30989,I,
30990,I,
30991,II,II
30992,II,
30993,II,1.
30994,II,
30995,II,"In some the genius is a thing apart,"
30996,II,"A pillared hermit of the brain,"
30997,II,Hoarding with incommunicable art
30998,II,Its intellectual gain;
30999,II,Man's web of circumstance and fate
31000,II,"They from their perch of self observe,"
31001,II,Indifferent as the figures on a slate
31002,II,Are to the planet's sun-swung curve
31003,II,Whose bright returns they calculate;     110
31004,II,"Their nice adjustment, part to part,"
31005,II,Were shaken from its serviceable mood
31006,II,By unpremeditated stirs of heart
31007,II,Or jar of human neighborhood:
31008,II,"Some find their natural selves, and only then,"
31009,II,"In furloughs of divine escape from men,"
31010,II,"And when, by that brief ecstasy left bare,"
31011,II,"Driven by some instinct of desire,"
31012,II,"They wander worldward, 'tis to blink and stare,"
31013,II,"Like wild things of the wood about a fire,     120"
31014,II,Dazed by the social glow they cannot share;
31015,II,"His nature brooked no lonely lair,"
31016,II,"But basked and bourgeoned in co-partnery,"
31017,II,"Companionship, and open-windowed glee:"
31018,II,"He knew, for he had tried,"
31019,II,Those speculative heights that lure
31020,II,"The unpractised foot, impatient of a guide,"
31021,II,Tow'rd ether too attenuately pure
31022,II,"For sweet unconscious breath, though dear to pride,"
31023,II,But better loved the foothold sure     130
31024,II,Of paths that wind by old abodes of men
31025,II,"Who hope at last the churchyard's peace secure,"
31026,II,"And follow time-worn rules, that them suffice,"
31027,II,"Learned from their sires, traditionally wise,"
31028,II,Careful of honest custom's how and when;
31029,II,"His mind, too brave to look on Truth askance,"
31030,II,"No more those habitudes of faith could share,"
31031,II,"But, tinged with sweetness of the old Swiss manse,"
31032,II,Lingered around them still and fain would spare.
31033,II,"Patient to spy a sullen egg for weeks,     140"
31034,II,"The enigma of creation to surprise,"
31035,II,His truer instinct sought the life that speaks
31036,II,Without a mystery from kindly eyes;
31037,II,"In no self-spun cocoon of prudence wound,"
31038,II,"He by the touch of men was best inspired,"
31039,II,And caught his native greatness at rebound
31040,II,From generosities itself had fired;
31041,II,"Then how the heat through every fibre ran,"
31042,II,"Felt in the gathering presence of the man,"
31043,II,While the apt word and gesture came unbid!     150
31044,II,"Virtues and faults it to one metal wrought,"
31045,II,"Fined all his blood to thought,"
31046,II,And ran the molten man in all he said or did.
31047,II,All Tully's rules and all Quintilian's too
31048,II,"He by the light of listening faces knew,"
31049,II,And his rapt audience all unconscious lent
31050,II,Their own roused force to make him eloquent;
31051,II,Persuasion fondled in his look and tone;
31052,II,Our speech (with strangers prudish) he could bring
31053,II,To find new charm in accents not her own;     160
31054,II,Her coy constraints and icy hindrances
31055,II,"Melted upon his lips to natural ease,"
31056,II,As a brook's fetters swell the dance of spring.
31057,II,"Nor yet all sweetness: not in vain he wore,"
31058,II,"Nor in the sheath of ceremony, controlled"
31059,II,"By velvet courtesy or caution cold,"
31060,II,"That sword of honest anger prized of old,"
31061,II,"But, with two-handed wrath,"
31062,II,"If baseness or pretension crossed his path,"
31063,II,Struck once nor needed to strike more.     170
31064,II,
31065,II,2.
31066,II,
31067,II,His magic was not far to seek.--
31068,II,"He was so human! Whether strong or weak,"
31069,II,"Far from his kind he neither sank nor soared,"
31070,II,But sate an equal guest at every board:
31071,II,"No beggar ever felt him condescend,"
31072,II,No prince presume; for still himself he bare
31073,II,"At manhood's simple level, and where'er"
31074,II,"He met a stranger, there he left a friend."
31075,II,"How large an aspect! nobly un-severe,"
31076,II,"With freshness round him of Olympian cheer,     180"
31077,II,Like visits of those earthly gods he came;
31078,II,"His look, wherever its good-fortune fell,"
31079,II,"Doubled the feast without a miracle,"
31080,II,And on the hearthstone danced a happier flame;
31081,II,Philemon's crabbed vintage grew benign;
31082,II,Amphitryon's gold-juice humanized to wine.
31083,II,
31084,II,
31085,III,III
31086,III,
31087,III,1.
31088,III,
31089,III,The garrulous memories
31090,III,"Gather again from all their far-flown nooks,"
31091,III,"Singly at first, and then by twos and threes,"
31092,III,"Then in a throng innumerable, as the rooks     190"
31093,III,Thicken their twilight files
31094,III,Tow'rd Tintern's gray repose of roofless aisles:
31095,III,Once more I see him at the table's head
31096,III,When Saturday her monthly banquet spread
31097,III,"To scholars, poets, wits,"
31098,III,"All choice, some famous, loving things, not names,"
31099,III,And so without a twinge at others' fames;
31100,III,"Such company as wisest moods befits,"
31101,III,Yet with no pedant blindness to the worth
31102,III,"Of undeliberate mirth,     200"
31103,III,
31104,III,"Natures benignly mixed of air and earth,"
31105,III,Now with the stars and now with equal zest
31106,III,Tracing the eccentric orbit of a jest.
31107,III,
31108,III,2.
31109,III,
31110,III,"I see in vision the warm-lighted hall,"
31111,III,"The living and the dead I see again,"
31112,III,And but my chair is empty; 'mid them all
31113,III,'Tis I that seem the dead: they all remain
31114,III,"Immortal, changeless creatures of the brain:"
31115,III,"Wellnigh I doubt which world is real most,"
31116,III,Of sense or spirit to the truly sane;     210
31117,III,In this abstraction it were light to deem
31118,III,Myself the figment of some stronger dream;
31119,III,"They are the real things, and I the ghost"
31120,III,"That glide unhindered through the solid door,"
31121,III,"Vainly for recognition seek from chair to chair,"
31122,III,"And strive to speak and am but futile air,"
31123,III,As truly most of us are little more.
31124,III,
31125,III,3.
31126,III,
31127,III,"Him most I see whom we most dearly miss,"
31128,III,"The latest parted thence,"
31129,III,His features poised in genial armistice     220
31130,III,And armed neutrality of self-defence
31131,III,"Beneath the forehead's walled preeminence,"
31132,III,"While Tyro, plucking facts with careless reach,"
31133,III,Settles off-hand our human how and whence;
31134,III,The long-trained veteran scarcely wincing hears
31135,III,The infallible strategy of volunteers
31136,III,"Making through Nature's walls its easy breach,"
31137,III,And seems to learn where he alone could teach.
31138,III,"Ample and ruddy, the board's end he fills"
31139,III,"As he our fireside were, our light and heat,     230"
31140,III,Centre where minds diverse and various skills
31141,III,Find their warm nook and stretch unhampered feet;
31142,III,"I see the firm benignity of face,"
31143,III,"Wide-smiling champaign, without tameness sweet,"
31144,III,"The mass Teutonic toned to Gallic grace,"
31145,III,The eyes whose sunshine runs before the lips
31146,III,"While Holmes's rockets, curve their long ellipse,"
31147,III,And burst in seeds of fire that burst again
31148,III,To drop in scintillating rain.
31149,III,
31150,III,4.
31151,III,
31152,III,"There too the face half-rustic, half-divine,     240"
31153,III,"Self-poised, sagacious, freaked with humor fine,"
31154,III,Of him who taught us not to mow and mope
31155,III,"About our fancied selves, but seek our scope"
31156,III,"In Nature's world and Man's, nor fade to hollow trope,"
31157,III,Content with our New World and timely bold
31158,III,To challenge the o'ermastery of the Old;
31159,III,Listening with eyes averse I see him sit
31160,III,Pricked with the cider of the Judge's wit
31161,III,"(Ripe-hearted homebrew, fresh and fresh again),"
31162,III,While the wise nose's firm-built aquiline     250
31163,III,Curves sharper to restrain
31164,III,The merriment whose most unruly moods
31165,III,Pass not the dumb laugh learned in listening woods
31166,III,Of silence-shedding pine:
31167,III,Hard by is he whose art's consoling spell
31168,III,"Hath given both worlds a whiff of asphodel,"
31169,III,His look still vernal 'mid the wintry ring
31170,III,"Of petals that remember, not foretell,"
31171,III,The paler primrose of a second spring.
31172,III,
31173,III,5.
31174,III,
31175,III,And more there are: but other forms arise     260
31176,III,"And seen as clear, albeit with dimmer eyes:"
31177,III,First he from sympathy still held apart
31178,III,"By shrinking over-eagerness of heart,"
31179,III,"Cloud charged with searching fire, whose shadow's sweep"
31180,III,"Heightened mean things with sense of brooding ill,"
31181,III,"And steeped in doom familiar field and hill,--"
31182,III,"New England's poet, soul reserved and deep,"
31183,III,"November nature with a name of May,"
31184,III,"Whom high o'er Concord plains we laid to sleep,"
31185,III,While the orchards mocked us in their white array     270
31186,III,"And building robins wondered at our tears,"
31187,III,"Snatched in his prime, the shape august"
31188,III,"That should have stood unbent 'neath fourscore years,"
31189,III,"The noble head, the eyes of furtive trust,"
31190,III,All gone to speechless dust.
31191,III,"And he our passing guest,"
31192,III,"Shy nature, too, and stung with life's unrest,"
31193,III,"Whom we too briefly had but could not hold,"
31194,III,"Who brought ripe Oxford's culture to our board,"
31195,III,"The Past's incalculable hoard,     280"
31196,III,"Mellowed by scutcheoned panes in cloisters old,"
31197,III,"Seclusions ivy-hushed, and pavements sweet"
31198,III,With immemorial lisp of musing feet;
31199,III,"Young head time-tonsured smoother than a friar's,"
31200,III,"Boy face, but grave with answerless desires,"
31201,III,"Poet in all that poets have of best,"
31202,III,"But foiled with riddles dark and cloudy aims,"
31203,III,"Who now hath found sure rest,"
31204,III,"Not by still Isis or historic Thames,"
31205,III,"Nor by the Charles he tried to love with me,     290"
31206,III,"But, not misplaced, by Arno's hallowed brim,"
31207,III,"Nor scorned by Santa Croce's neighboring fames,"
31208,III,"Haply not mindless, wheresoe'er he be,"
31209,III,"Of violets that to-day I scattered over him,"
31210,III,"He, too, is there,"
31211,III,"After the good centurion fitly named,"
31212,III,"Whom learning dulled not, nor convention tamed,"
31213,III,"Shaking with burly mirth his hyacinthine hair,"
31214,III,"Our hearty Grecian of Homeric ways,"
31215,III,Still found the surer friend where least he hoped the praise.
31216,III,
31217,III,6.
31218,III,
31219,III,"Yea truly, as the sallowing years     301"
31220,III,"Fall from us faster, like frost-loosened leaves"
31221,III,"Pushed by the misty touch of shortening days,"
31222,III,"And that unwakened winter nears,"
31223,III,"'Tis the void chair our surest guest receives,"
31224,III,"'Tis lips long cold that give the warmest kiss,"
31225,III,'Tis the lost voice comes oftenest to our ears;
31226,III,We count our rosary by the beads we miss:
31227,III,"To me, at least, it seemeth so,"
31228,III,"An exile in the land once found divine,     310"
31229,III,"While my starved fire burns low,"
31230,III,And homeless winds at the loose casement whine
31231,III,Shrill ditties of the snow-roofed Apennine.

31234,IV,IV
31235,IV,
31236,IV,1.
31237,IV,
31238,IV,"Now forth into the darkness all are gone,"
31239,IV,"But memory, still unsated, follows on,"
31240,IV,"Retracing step by step our homeward walk,"
31241,IV,"With many a laugh among our serious talk,"
31242,IV,"Across the bridge where, on the dimpling tide,"
31243,IV,"The long red streamers from the windows glide,"
31244,IV,Or the dim western moon
31245,IV,"Rocks her skiff's image on the broad lagoon,     321"
31246,IV,And Boston shows a soft Venetian side
31247,IV,"In that Arcadian light when roof and tree,"
31248,IV,"Hard prose by daylight, dream in Italy;"
31249,IV,Or haply in the sky's cold chambers wide
31250,IV,"Shivered the winter stars, while all below,"
31251,IV,"As if an end were come of human ill,"
31252,IV,The world was wrapt in innocence of snow
31253,IV,And the cast-iron bay was blind and still;
31254,IV,These were our poetry; in him perhaps     330
31255,IV,"Science had barred the gate that lets in dream,"
31256,IV,And he would rather count the perch and bream
31257,IV,Than with the current's idle fancy lapse;
31258,IV,And yet he had the poet's open eye
31259,IV,"That takes a frank delight in all it sees,"
31260,IV,"Nor was earth voiceless, nor the mystic sky,"
31261,IV,To him the life-long friend of fields and trees:
31262,IV,"Then came the prose of the suburban street,"
31263,IV,"Its silence deepened by our echoing feet,"
31264,IV,And converse such as rambling hazard finds;     340
31265,IV,"Then he who many cities knew and many minds,"
31266,IV,"And men once world-noised, now mere Ossian forms"
31267,IV,"Of misty memory, bade them live anew"
31268,IV,"As when they shared earth's manifold delight,"
31269,IV,"In shape, in gait, in voice, in gesture true,"
31270,IV,"And, with an accent heightening as he warms,"
31271,IV,"Would stop forgetful of the shortening night,"
31272,IV,"Drop my confining arm, and pour profuse"
31273,IV,"Much worldly wisdom kept for others' use,"
31274,IV,"Not for his own, for he was rash and free,     350"
31275,IV,"His purse or knowledge all men's, like the sea."
31276,IV,Still can I hear his voice's shrilling might
31277,IV,"(With pauses broken, while the fitful spark"
31278,IV,He blew more hotly rounded on the dark
31279,IV,To hint his features with a Rembrandt light)
31280,IV,"Call Oken back, or Humboldt, or Lamarck,"
31281,IV,"Or Cuvier's taller shade, and many more"
31282,IV,"Whom he had seen, or knew from others' sight,"
31283,IV,And make them men to me as ne'er before:
31284,IV,"Not seldom, as the undeadened fibre stirred     360"
31285,IV,"Of noble friendships knit beyond the sea,"
31286,IV,"German or French thrust by the lagging word,"
31287,IV,For a good leash of mother-tongues had he.
31288,IV,"At last, arrived at where our paths divide,"
31289,IV,"'Good night!' and, ere the distance grew too wide,"
31290,IV,'Good night!' again; and now with cheated ear

31295,IV,Sometimes it seemed as if New England air
31296,IV,"For his large lungs too parsimonious were,"
31297,IV,As if those empty rooms of dogma drear     370
31298,IV,Where the ghost shivers of a faith austere
31299,IV,"Counting the horns o'er of the Beast,"
31300,IV,"Still scaring those whose faith to it is least,"
31301,IV,As if those snaps o' th' moral atmosphere
31302,IV,"That sharpen all the needles of the East,"
31303,IV,"Had been to him like death,"
31304,IV,Accustomed to draw Europe's freer breath
31305,IV,In a more stable element;
31306,IV,"Nay, even our landscape, half the year morose,"
31307,IV,"Our practical horizon, grimly pent,     380"
31308,IV,"Our air, sincere of ceremonious haze,"
31309,IV,"Forcing hard outlines mercilessly close,"
31310,IV,"Our social monotone of level days,"
31311,IV,Might make our best seem banishment;
31312,IV,But it was nothing so;
31313,IV,"Haply this instinct might divine,"
31314,IV,"Beneath our drift of puritanic snow,"
31315,IV,The marvel sensitive and fine
31316,IV,Of sanguinaria over-rash to blow
31317,IV,And trust its shyness to an air malign;     390
31318,IV,Well might he prize truth's warranty and pledge
31319,IV,"In the grim outcrop of our granite edge,"
31320,IV,Or Hebrew fervor flashing forth at need
31321,IV,"In the gaunt sons of Calvin's iron breed,"
31322,IV,As prompt to give as skilled to win and keep;
31323,IV,"But, though such intuitions might not cheer,"
31324,IV,"Yet life was good to him, and, there or here,"
31325,IV,"With that sufficing joy, the day was never cheap;"
31326,IV,"Thereto his mind was its own ample sphere,"
31327,IV,"And, like those buildings great that through the year     400"
31328,IV,"Carry one temperature, his nature large"
31329,IV,"Made its own climate, nor could any marge"
31330,IV,Traced by convention stay him from his bent:
31331,IV,He had a habitude of mountain air;
31332,IV,"He brought wide outlook where he went,"
31333,IV,And could on sunny uplands dwell
31334,IV,Of prospect sweeter than the pastures fair
31335,IV,High-hung of viny Neufchâtel;
31336,IV,"Nor, surely, did he miss"
31337,IV,"Some pale, imaginary bliss"

31345,V,I cannot think he wished so soon to die
31346,V,"With all his senses full of eager heat,"
31347,V,And rosy years that stood expectant by
31348,V,"To buckle the winged sandals on their feet,"
31349,V,"He that was friends with Earth, and all her sweet"
31350,V,Took with both hands unsparingly:
31351,V,"Truly this life is precious to the root,"
31352,V,And good the feel of grass beneath the foot;
31353,V,"To lie in buttercups and clover-bloom,     420"
31354,V,"Tenants in common with the bees,"
31355,V,"And watch the white clouds drift through gulfs of trees,"
31356,V,Is better than long waiting in the tomb;
31357,V,Only once more to feel the coming spring

31359,V,Only once more to see the moon
31360,V,Through leaf-fringed abbey-arches of the elms
31361,V,Curve her mild sickle in the West
31362,V,"Sweet with the breath of haycocks, were a boon"
31363,V,Worth any promise of soothsayer realms     430
31364,V,Or casual hope of being elsewhere blest;
31365,V,To take December by the beard
31366,V,"And crush the creaking snow with springy foot,"
31367,V,"While overhead the North's dumb streamers shoot,"
31368,V,"Till Winter fawn upon the cheek endeared,"
31369,V,Then the long evening-ends

31371,V,With high companionship of books
31372,V,Or slippered talk of friends
31373,V,"And sweet habitual looks,"

31382,V,Their work is ended with their day;
31383,V,"Another fills their room; 't is the World's ancient way,"

31385,V,"But the deft spinners of the brain,"
31386,V,"Who love each added day and find it gain,     450"
31387,V,Them overtakes the doom
31388,V,To snap the half-grown flower upon the loom
31389,V,"(Trophy that was to be of life long pain),"
31390,V,The thread no other skill can ever knit again.
31391,V,"'Twas so with him, for he was glad to live,"
31392,V,"'Twas doubly so, for he left work begun;"
31393,V,Could not this eagerness of Fate forgive
31394,V,Till all the allotted flax were spun?
31395,V,"It matters not; for, go at night or noon,"
31396,V,"A friend, whene'er he dies, has died too soon,     460"

31408,VI,"I see it wind through that unsightly grove,"
31409,VI,"Once beautiful, but long defaced"
31410,VI,With granite permanence of cockney taste
31411,VI,And all those grim disfigurements we love:
31412,VI,"There, then, we leave him: Him? such costly waste     470"
31413,VI,Nature rebels at: and it is not true
31414,VI,Of those most precious parts of him we knew:
31415,VI,"Could we be conscious but as dreamers be,"
31416,VI,'Twere sweet to leave this shifting life of tents
31417,VI,Sunk in the changeless calm of Deity;
31418,VI,"Nay, to be mingled with the elements,"
31419,VI,"The fellow-servants of creative powers,"
31420,VI,"Partaker in the solemn year's events,"
31421,VI,"To share the work of busy-fingered hours,"
31422,VI,"To be night's silent almoner of dew,     480"
31423,VI,"To rise again in plants and breathe and grow,"
31424,VI,"To stream as tides the ocean caverns through,"
31425,VI,Or with the rapture of great winds to blow
31426,VI,"About earth's shaken coignes, were not a fate"
31427,VI,To leave us all-disconsolate;
31428,VI,Even endless slumber in the sweetening sod
31429,VI,Of charitable earth
31430,VI,"That takes out all our mortal stains,"
31431,VI,"And makes us cleanlier neighbors of the clod,"
31432,VI,Methinks were better worth
31433,VI,"Than the poor fruit of most men's wakeful pains,    491"
31434,VI,The heart's insatiable ache:
31435,VI,"But such was not his faith,"
31436,VI,Nor mine: it may be he had trod
31437,VI,"Outside the plain old path of _God thus spake_,"
31438,VI,But God to him was very God
31439,VI,And not a visionary wraith
31440,VI,"Skulking in murky corners of the mind,"
31441,VI,And he was sure to be
31442,VI,"Somehow, somewhere, imperishable as He,     500"
31443,VI,"Not with His essence mystically combined,"
31444,VI,"As some high spirits long, but whole and free,"
31445,VI,A perfected and conscious Agassiz.
31446,VI,And such I figure him: the wise of old
31447,VI,"Welcome and own him of their peaceful fold,"
31448,VI,Not truly with the guild enrolled
31449,VI,Of him who seeking inward guessed
31450,VI,"Diviner riddles than the rest,"
31451,VI,And groping in the darks of thought
31452,VI,Touched the Great Hand and knew it not;        510
31453,VI,"Rather he shares the daily light,"
31454,VI,"From reason's charier fountains won,"
31455,VI,"Of his great chief, the slow-paced Stagyrite,"
31456,VI,And Cuvier clasps once more his long-lost son.

31463,VI,Unvalued will its golden secrets keep:
31464,VI,He knows at last if Life or Death be best:
31465,VI,"Wherever he be flown, whatever vest              520"
31466,VI,The being hath put on which lately here
31467,VI,"So many-friended was, so full of cheer"
31468,VI,"To make men feel the Seeker's noble zest,"
31469,VI,We have not lost him all; he is not gone
31470,VI,To the dumb herd of them that wholly die;
31471,VI,The beauty of his better self lives on
31472,VI,"In minds he touched with fire, in many an eye"
31473,VI,He trained to Truth's exact severity;
31474,VI,He was a Teacher: why be grieved for him
31475,VI,Whose living word still stimulates the air?      530
31476,VI,In endless file shall loving scholars come
31477,VI,"The glow of his transmitted touch to share,"
31478,VI,And trace his features with an eye less dim
31479,VI,Than ours whose sense familiar wont makes dumb.

32200,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Calm days that loiter with snow-silent tread,"

32208,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Dear were my walks, too, gathering fragrant store"
32209,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Of Mother Nature's simple-minded lore:
32210,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I learned all weather-signs of day or night;
32211,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"No bird but I could name him by his flight,"
32212,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"No distant tree but by his shape was known,"
32213,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Or, near at hand, by leaf or bark alone."
32214,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,This learning won by loving looks I hived
32215,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,As sweeter lore than all from books derived.
32216,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"I know the charm of hillside, field, and wood,"
32217,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Of lake and stream, and the sky's downy brood,      120"
32218,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Of roads sequestered rimmed with sallow sod,"
32219,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"But friends with hardhack, aster, goldenrod,"
32220,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Or succory keeping summer long its trust
32221,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Of heaven-blue fleckless from the eddying dust:
32222,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"These were my earliest friends, and latest too,"
32223,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Still unestranged, whatever fate may do."
32224,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"For years I had these treasures, knew their worth,"
32225,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Estate most real man can have on earth.
32226,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I sank too deep in this soft-stuffed repose
32227,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,That hears but rumors of earth's wrongs and woes;     130
32228,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Too well these Capuas could my muscles waste,"
32229,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Not void of toils, but toils of choice and taste;"
32230,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,These still had kept me could I but have quelled
32231,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,The Puritan drop that in my veins rebelled.
32232,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,But there were times when silent were my books
32233,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"As jailers are, and gave me sullen looks,"
32234,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"When verses palled, and even the woodland path,"
32235,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"By innocent contrast, fed my heart with wrath,"
32236,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,And I must twist my little gift of words
32237,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Into a scourge of rough and knotted cords           140
32238,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Unmusical, that whistle as they swing"
32239,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,To leave on shameless backs their purple sting.
32240,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,
32241,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,How slow Time comes! Gone who so swift as he?
32242,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Add but a year, 'tis half a century"
32243,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Since the slave's stifled moaning broke my sleep,"
32244,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Heard 'gainst my will in that seclusion deep,"
32245,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Haply heard louder for the silence there,"
32246,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,And so my fancied safeguard made my snare.
32247,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"After that moan had sharpened to a cry,"
32248,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"And a cloud, hand-broad then, heaped all our sky     150"
32249,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"With its stored vengeance, and such thunders stirred"
32250,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"As heaven's and earth's remotest chambers heard,"
32251,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I looked to see an ampler atmosphere
32252,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,By that electric passion-gust blown clear.
32253,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I looked for this; consider what I see--
32254,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"But I forbear, 'twould please nor you nor me"
32255,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,To check the items in the bitter list
32256,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Of all I counted on and all I mist.
32257,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Only three instances I choose from all,"
32258,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,And each enough to stir a pigeon's gall:            160
32259,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Office a fund for ballot-brokers made
32260,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,To pay the drudges of their gainful trade;
32261,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Our cities taught what conquered cities feel
32262,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,By ædiles chosen that they might safely steal;
32263,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"And gold, however got, a title fair"
32264,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,To such respect as only gold can bear.
32265,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I seem to see this; how shall I gainsay
32266,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,What all our journals tell me every day?
32267,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Poured our young martyrs their high-hearted blood
32268,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,That we might trample to congenial mud              170
32269,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,The soil with such a legacy sublimed?
32270,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Methinks an angry scorn is here well-timed:
32271,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Where find retreat? How keep reproach at bay?
32272,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Where'er I turn some scandal fouls the way.
32273,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,

32276,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Flows flecked with gold of thought, whose generous mind"
32277,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Sees Paradise regained by all mankind,"
32278,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Whose brave example still to vanward shines,"
32279,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Cheeks the retreat, and spurs our lagging lines.     180"
32280,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Was I too bitter? Who his phrase can choose
32281,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,That sees the life-blood of his dearest ooze?
32282,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,I loved my Country so as only they
32283,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Who love a mother fit to die for may;
32284,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"I loved her old renown, her stainless fame,--"
32285,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,What better proof than that I loathed her shame?
32286,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"That many blamed me could not irk me long,"
32287,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"But, if you doubted, must I not be wrong?"
32288,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,'Tis not for me to answer; this I know.
32289,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,That man or race so prosperously low                190
32290,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,"Sunk in success that wrath they cannot feel,"
32291,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Shall taste the spurn of parting Fortune's heel;
32292,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,For never land long lease of empire won
32293,AN EPISTLE TO GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,Whose sons sate silent when base deeds were done.

32315,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",Shivering sometimes it calls me as it hears
32316,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",Afar the charge's tramp and clash of spears;

32318,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","The sea-shell's lost tradition of the sea,"
32319,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",That makes me muse and wonder Where? and When?
32320,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",While from my cliff I watch the waves of men
32321,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","That climb to break midway their seeming gain,"
32322,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",And think it triumph if they shake their chain.
32323,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",Little I ask of Fate; will she refuse
32324,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",Some days of reconcilement with the Muse?           220

32327,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","And, as its stops my curious touch retries,"
32328,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","The stir of earlier instincts I surprise,--"
32329,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","Instincts, if less imperious, yet more strong,"
32330,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887",And happy in the toil that ends with song.

32332,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","Home am I come: not, as I hoped might be,"
32333,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","To the old haunts, too full of ghosts for me,"
32334,"POSTSCRIPT, 1887","But to the olden dreams that time endears,"

32379,I,"My day began not till the twilight fell,"
32380,I,"And, lo, in ether from heaven's sweetest well,"
32381,I,The New Moon swam divinely isolate
32382,I,"In maiden silence, she that makes my fate"
32383,I,"Haply not knowing it, or only so"
32384,I,As I the secrets of my sheep may know;
32385,I,"Nor ask I more, entirely blest if she,"
32386,I,"In letting me adore, ennoble me"
32387,I,"To height of what the Gods meant making man,"
32388,I,As only she and her best beauty can.                 10
32389,I,Mine be the love that in itself can find
32390,I,"Seed of white thoughts, the lilies of the mind,"
32391,I,Seed of that glad surrender of the will
32392,I,That finds in service self's true purpose still:
32393,I,Love that in outward fairness sees the tent
32394,I,Pitched for an inmate far more excellent;
32395,I,"Love with a light irradiate to the core,"
32396,I,"Lit at her lamp, but fed from inborn store;"
32397,I,Love thrice-requited with the single joy
32398,I,"Of an immaculate vision naught could cloy,           20"
32399,I,"Dearer because, so high beyond my scope,"
32400,I,"My life grew rich with her, unbribed by hope"
32401,I,Of other guerdon save to think she knew
32402,I,One grateful votary paid her all her due;
32403,I,"Happy if she, high-radiant there, resigned"
32404,I,To his sure trust her image in his mind.
32405,I,O fairer even than Peace is when she comes
32406,I,"Hushing War's tumult, and retreating drums"
32407,I,Fade to a murmur like the sough of bees
32408,I,"Hidden among the noon-stilled linden-trees,          30"
32409,I,"Bringer of quiet, thou that canst allay"
32410,I,"The dust and din and travail of the day,"
32411,I,"Strewer of Silence, Giver of the dew"
32412,I,"That doth our pastures and our souls renew,"
32413,I,"Still dwell remote, still on thy shoreless sea"
32414,I,"Float unattained in silent empery,"
32415,I,"Still light my thoughts, nor listen to a prayer"

32423,II,Ask I no more? Since yesterday I task
32424,II,My storm-strewn thoughts to tell me what I ask:
32425,II,Faint premenitions of mutation strange
32426,II,"Steal o'er my perfect orb, and, with the change,"
32427,II,Myself am changed; the shadow of my earth
32428,II,Darkens the disk of that celestial worth
32429,II,Which only yesterday could still suffice
32430,II,Upwards to waft my thoughts in sacrifice;
32431,II,My heightened fancy with its touches warm
32432,II,Moulds to a woman's that ideal form;                 50
32433,II,"Nor yet a woman's wholly, but divine"
32434,II,With awe her purer essence bred in mine.
32435,II,"Was it long brooding on their own surmise,"
32436,II,"Which, of the eyes engendered, fools the eyes,"
32437,II,Or have I seen through that translucent air
32438,II,"A Presence shaped in its seclusions bare,"
32439,II,My Goddess looking on me from above
32440,II,"As look our russet maidens when they love,"
32441,II,"But high-uplifted, o'er our human heat"
32442,II,And passion-paths too rough for her pearl feet?      60
32443,II,
32444,II,Slowly the Shape took outline as I gazed
32445,II,"At her full-orbed or crescent, till, bedazed"
32446,II,With wonder-working light that subtly wrought
32447,II,"My brain to its own substance, steeping thought"
32448,II,"In trances such as poppies give, I saw"
32449,II,"Things shut from vision by sight's sober law,"
32450,II,"Amorphous, changeful, but defined at last"
32451,II,Into the peerless Shape mine eyes hold fast.
32452,II,"This, too, at first I worshipt: soon, like wine,"
32453,II,"Her eyes, in mine poured, frenzy-philtred mine;      70"
32454,II,Passion put Worship's priestly raiment on
32455,II,"And to the woman knelt, the Goddess gone."
32456,II,"Was I, then, more than mortal made? or she"
32457,II,Less than divine that she might mate with me?
32458,II,"If mortal merely, could my nature cope"
32459,II,With such o'ermastery of maddening hope?
32460,II,"If Goddess, could she feel the blissful woe"

32467,III,Far as the grape-bunch of the Pleiad seven           80
32468,III,Beyond my madness' utmost leap; but here
32469,III,"Mine eyes have feigned of late her rapture near,"
32470,III,"Moulded of mind-mist that broad day dispels,"
32471,III,Here in these shadowy woods and brook-lulled dells.
32472,III,
32473,III,Have no heaven-habitants e'er felt a void
32474,III,In hearts sublimed with ichor unalloyed?
32475,III,E'er longed to mingle with a mortal fate
32476,III,Intense with pathos of its briefer date?
32477,III,"Could she partake, and live, our human stains?"
32478,III,Even with the thought there tingles through my veins     90
32479,III,"Sense of unwarned renewal; I, the dead,"
32480,III,"Receive and house again the ardor fled,"
32481,III,As once Alcestis; to the ruddy brim
32482,III,"Feel masculine virtue flooding every limb,"
32483,III,"And life, like Spring returning, brings the key"
32484,III,"That sets my senses from their winter free,"
32485,III,Dancing like naked fauns too glad for shame.
32486,III,"Her passion, purified to palest flame,"
32487,III,Can it thus kindle? Is her purpose this?
32488,III,"I will not argue, lest I lose a bliss               100"
32489,III,"That makes me dream Tithonus' fortune mine,"
32490,III,(Or what of it was palpably divine
32491,III,Ere came the fruitlessly immortal gift;)
32492,III,I cannot curb my hope's imperious drift
32493,III,That wings with fire my dull mortality;
32494,III,"Though fancy-forged, 'tis all I feel or see."

32498,IV,
32499,IV,My Goddess sinks; round Latmos' darkening brow
32500,IV,"Trembles the parting of her presence now,"
32501,IV,Faint as the perfume left upon the grass
32502,IV,By her limbs' pressure or her feet that pass        110
32503,IV,"By me conjectured, but conjectured so"
32504,IV,As things I touch far fainter substance show.
32505,IV,Was it mine eyes' imposture I have seen
32506,IV,Flit with the moonbeams on from shade to sheen
32507,IV,"Through the wood-openings? Nay, I see her now"
32508,IV,"Out of her heaven new-lighted, from her brow"
32509,IV,"The hair breeze-scattered, like loose mists that blow"
32510,IV,"Across her crescent, goldening as they go"
32511,IV,"High-kirtled for the chase, and what was shown,"
32512,IV,"Of maiden rondure, like the rose half-blown.        120"
32513,IV,"If dream, turn real! If a vision, stay!"
32514,IV,"Take mortal shape, my philtre's spell obey!"
32515,IV,If hags compel thee from thy secret sky
32516,IV,"With gruesome incantations, why not I,"
32517,IV,Whose only magic is that I distil
32518,IV,"A potion, blent of passion, thought, and will,"
32519,IV,"Deeper in reach, in force of fate more rich,"
32520,IV,Than e'er was juice wrung by Thessalian witch
32521,IV,"From moon-enchanted herbs,--a potion brewed"
32522,IV,Of my best life in each diviner mood?               130
32523,IV,"Myself the elixir am, myself the bowl"
32524,IV,Seething and mantling with my soul of soul.
32525,IV,"Taste and be humanized: what though the cup,"
32526,IV,"With thy lips frenzied, shatter? Drink it up!"
32527,IV,"If but these arms may clasp, o'erquited so,"
32528,IV,"My world, thy heaven, all life means I shall know."
32529,IV,
32530,IV,
32531,V,V
32532,V,
32533,V,"Sure she hath heard my prayer and granted half,"
32534,V,As Gods do who at mortal madness laugh.
32535,V,"Yet if life's solid things illusion seem,"
32536,V,Why may not substance wear the mask of dream?       140
32537,V,"In sleep she comes; she visits me in dreams,"
32538,V,"And, as her image in a thousand streams,"
32539,V,"So in my veins, that her obey, she sees,"
32540,V,"Floating and flaming there, her images"
32541,V,Bear to my little world's remotest zone
32542,V,"Glad messages of her, and her alone."
32543,V,"With silence-sandalled Sleep she comes to me,"
32544,V,"(But softer-footed, sweeter-browed, than she,)"
32545,V,"In motion gracious as a seagull's wing,"
32546,V,"And all her bright limbs, moving, seem to sing.     150"
32547,V,"Let me believe so, then, if so I may"
32548,V,With the night's bounty feed my beggared day.
32549,V,In dreams I see her lay the goddess down
32550,V,"With bow and quiver, and her crescent-crown"
32551,V,Flicker and fade away to dull eclipse
32552,V,As down to mine she deigns her longed-for lips;
32553,V,"And as her neck my happy arms enfold,"
32554,V,"Flooded and lustred with her loosened gold,"
32555,V,She whispers words each sweeter than a kiss:
32556,V,"Then, wakened with the shock of sudden bliss,       160"
32557,V,"My arms are empty, my awakener fled,"
32558,V,"And, silent in the silent sky o'erhead,"
32559,V,"But coldly as on ice-plated snow, she gleams,"
32560,V,Herself the mother and the child of dreams.
32561,V,

32563,VI,VI
32564,VI,
32565,VI,Gone is the time when phantasms could appease
32566,VI,My quest phantasmal and bring cheated ease;
32567,VI,"When, if she glorified my dreams, I felt"
32568,VI,Through all my limbs a change immortal melt
32569,VI,At touch of hers illuminate with soul.
32570,VI,Not long could I be stilled with Fancy's dole;      170
32571,VI,Too soon the mortal mixture in me caught
32572,VI,"Red fire from her celestial flame, and fought"
32573,VI,For tyrannous control in all my veins:
32574,VI,My fool's prayer was accepted; what remains?
32575,VI,"Or was it some eidolon merely, sent"
32576,VI,"By her who rules the shades in banishment,"
32577,VI,"To mock me with her semblance? Were it thus,"
32578,VI,"How 'scape I shame, whose will was traitorous?"
32579,VI,What shall compensate an ideal dimmed?
32580,VI,"How blanch again my statue virgin-limbed,           180"
32581,VI,Soiled with the incense-smoke her chosen priest
32582,VI,Poured more profusely as within decreased
32583,VI,"The fire unearthly, fed with coals from far"
32584,VI,Within the soul's shrine? Could my fallen star
32585,VI,Be set in heaven again by prayers and tears
32586,VI,"And quenchless sacrifice of all my years,"
32587,VI,"How would the victim to the flamen leap,"
32588,VI,And life for life's redemption paid hold cheap!
32589,VI,
32590,VI,But what resource when she herself descends
32591,VI,"From her blue throne, and o'er her vassal bends     190"
32592,VI,"That shape thrice-deified by love, those eyes"
32593,VI,Wherein the Lethe of all others lies?
32594,VI,"When my white queen of heaven's remoteness tires,"
32595,VI,"Herself against her other self conspires,"
32596,VI,"Takes woman's nature, walks in mortal ways,"
32597,VI,And finds in my remorse her beauty's praise?
32598,VI,Yet all would I renounce to dream again
32599,VI,"The dream in dreams fulfilled that made my pain,"
32600,VI,My noble pain that heightened all my years
32601,VI,With crowns to win and prowess-breeding tears;      200
32602,VI,"Nay, would that dream renounce once more to see"
32603,VI,Her from her sky there looking down at me!
32604,VI,
32605,VI,
32606,VII,VII
32607,VII,
32608,VII,"Goddess, reclimb thy heaven, and be once more"
32609,VII,"An inaccessible splendor to adore,"
32610,VII,"A faith, a hope of such transcendent worth"
32611,VII,As bred ennobling discontent with earth;
32612,VII,"Give back the longing, back the elated mood"
32613,VII,"That, fed with thee, spurned every meaner good;"
32614,VII,Give even the spur of impotent despair
32615,VII,"That, without hope, still bade aspire and dare;     210"
32616,VII,"Give back the need to worship, that still pours"
32617,VII,Down to the soul the virtue it adores!
32618,VII,
32619,VII,"Nay, brightest and most beautiful, deem naught"
32620,VII,"These frantic words, the reckless wind of thought;"
32621,VII,"Still stoop, still grant,--I live but in thy will;"
32622,VII,"Be what thou wilt, but be a woman still!"
32623,VII,"Vainly I cried, nor could myself believe"

32640,A BRETON LEGEND,"With the wreck lying near on the crest of the beach,"
32641,A BRETON LEGEND,"Roofless and splintered with thunder-stone,"

32645,A BRETON LEGEND,
32646,A BRETON LEGEND,"Something like this, then, my guide had to tell,"
32647,A BRETON LEGEND,Perched on a saint cracked across when he fell;      10
32648,A BRETON LEGEND,"But since I might chance give his meaning a wrench,"
32649,A BRETON LEGEND,"He talking his _patois_ and I English-French,"
32650,A BRETON LEGEND,"I'll put what he told me, preserving the tone,"

32652,A BRETON LEGEND,
32653,A BRETON LEGEND,"An abbey-church stood here, once on a time,"
32654,A BRETON LEGEND,Built as a death-bed atonement for crime:
32655,A BRETON LEGEND,"'Twas for somebody's sins, I know not whose;"
32656,A BRETON LEGEND,"But sinners are plenty, and you can choose."
32657,A BRETON LEGEND,"Though a cloister now of the dusk-winged bat,"

32659,A BRETON LEGEND,"Looser in girdle and purpler in jowl,"
32660,A BRETON LEGEND,Singing good rest to the founder's lost soul.
32661,A BRETON LEGEND,
32662,A BRETON LEGEND,"But one day came Northmen, and lithe tongues of fire"
32663,A BRETON LEGEND,"Lapped up the chapter-house, licked off the spire,"
32664,A BRETON LEGEND,"And left all a rubbish-heap, black and dreary,"
32665,A BRETON LEGEND,Where only the wind sings _miserere_.
32666,A BRETON LEGEND,
32667,A BRETON LEGEND,"No priest has kneeled since at the altar's foot,"
32668,A BRETON LEGEND,"Whose crannies are searched by the nightshade's root,"

32670,A BRETON LEGEND,"Except from throat of the unclean bird,              30"
32671,A BRETON LEGEND,Hooting to unassoiled shapes as they pass
32672,A BRETON LEGEND,"In midnights unholy his witches' mass,"
32673,A BRETON LEGEND,Or shouting 'Ho! ho!' from the belfry high
32674,A BRETON LEGEND,As the Devil's sabbath-train whirls by.

32676,A BRETON LEGEND,"But once a year, on the eve of All-Souls,"

32682,A BRETON LEGEND,"And the ghosts must come, so the legend saith,"
32683,A BRETON LEGEND,To a preaching of Reverend Doctor Death.
32684,A BRETON LEGEND,
32685,A BRETON LEGEND,"Abbots, monks, barons, and ladies fair"
32686,A BRETON LEGEND,Hear the dull summons and gather there:
32687,A BRETON LEGEND,"No rustle of silk now, no clink of mail,"
32688,A BRETON LEGEND,Nor ever a one greets his church-mate pale;
32689,A BRETON LEGEND,"No knight whispers love in the _châtelaine's_ ear,"
32690,A BRETON LEGEND,His next-door neighbor this five-hundred year;
32691,A BRETON LEGEND,No monk has a sleek _benedicite_
32692,A BRETON LEGEND,For the great lord shadowy now as he;                50
32693,A BRETON LEGEND,"Nor needeth any to hold his breath,"
32694,A BRETON LEGEND,Lest he lose the least word of Doctor Death.
32695,A BRETON LEGEND,
32696,A BRETON LEGEND,"He chooses his text in the Book Divine,"
32697,A BRETON LEGEND,Tenth verse of the Preacher in chapter nine:
32698,A BRETON LEGEND,"'""Whatsoever thy hand shall find thee to do,"
32699,A BRETON LEGEND,"That do with thy whole might, or thou shalt rue;"
32700,A BRETON LEGEND,"For no man is wealthy, or wise, or brave,"
32701,A BRETON LEGEND,"In that quencher of might-be's and would-be's, the grave."""
32702,A BRETON LEGEND,"Bid by the Bridegroom, ""To-morrow,"" ye said,"
32703,A BRETON LEGEND,And To-morrow was digging a trench for your bed;     60
32704,A BRETON LEGEND,"Ye said, ""God can wait; let us finish our wine;"""
32705,A BRETON LEGEND,"Ye had wearied Him, fools, and that last knock was mine!'"
32706,A BRETON LEGEND,
32707,A BRETON LEGEND,"But I can't pretend to give you the sermon,"
32708,A BRETON LEGEND,"Or say if the tongue were French, Latin, or German;"
32709,A BRETON LEGEND,"Whatever he preached in, I give you my word"
32710,A BRETON LEGEND,The meaning was easy to all that heard;
32711,A BRETON LEGEND,"Famous preachers there have been and be,"
32712,A BRETON LEGEND,But never was one so convincing as he;
32713,A BRETON LEGEND,"So blunt was never a begging friar,"
32714,A BRETON LEGEND,"No Jesuit's tongue so barbed with fire,              70"
32715,A BRETON LEGEND,"Cameronian never, nor Methodist,"
32716,A BRETON LEGEND,Wrung gall out of Scripture with such a twist.
32717,A BRETON LEGEND,
32718,A BRETON LEGEND,And would you know who his hearers must be?
32719,A BRETON LEGEND,I tell you just what my guide told me:
32720,A BRETON LEGEND,"Excellent teaching men have, day and night,"
32721,A BRETON LEGEND,"From two earnest friars, a black and a white,"
32722,A BRETON LEGEND,The Dominican Death and the Carmelite Life;
32723,A BRETON LEGEND,"And between these two there is never strife,"
32724,A BRETON LEGEND,"For each has his separate office and station,"
32725,A BRETON LEGEND,And each his own work in the congregation;           80
32726,A BRETON LEGEND,"Whoso to the white brother deafens his ears,"
32727,A BRETON LEGEND,"And cannot be wrought on by blessings or tears,"
32728,A BRETON LEGEND,"Awake In his coffin must wait and wait,"
32729,A BRETON LEGEND,"In that blackness of darkness that means _too late_,"
32730,A BRETON LEGEND,"And come once a year, when the ghost-bell tolls,"
32731,A BRETON LEGEND,"As till Doomsday it shall on the eve of All-Souls,"
32732,A BRETON LEGEND,"To hear Doctor Death, whose words smart with the brine"

32742,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,And in Arcadia ere I knew it.
32743,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,
32744,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"Fresh sward for gravel soothed my tread,"

32768,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,
32769,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"'_Et ego_', sighed I to myself,"

32773,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,
32774,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"'An idyl ever newly sweet,"
32775,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"Although since Adam's day recited,                 30"

32781,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"For even our honeymoons must wane,"
32782,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,Convicted of green cheese by Reason.
32783,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,
32784,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"And none will seem so safe from change,"
32785,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"Nor in such skies benignant hover,"
32786,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"As this, beneath whose witchery strange"
32787,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,You tread on rose-leaves with your lover.         40
32788,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,
32789,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,"The glass unfilled all tastes can fit,"
32790,ARCADIA REDIVIVA,As round its brim Conjecture dances;

34227,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And wrapped him so in humors, sheath on sheath,"
34228,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,'Twas hard to guess the mellow soul beneath:
34229,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But, once divined, you took him to your heart,"

34234,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Withdrawn ere fully shown, and mixed of both."
34235,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,A cynic? Not precisely: one who thrust
34236,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Against a heart too prone to love and trust,"
34237,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Who so despised false sentiment he knew
34238,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Scarce in himself to part the false and true,"
34239,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And strove to hide, by roughening-o'er the skin,"
34240,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Those cobweb nerves he could not dull within.
34241,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Gentle by birth, but of a stem decayed,"
34242,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,He shunned life's rivalries and hated trade;         20
34243,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"On a small patrimony and larger pride,"
34244,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,He lived uneaseful on the Other Side
34245,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"(So he called Europe), only coming West"
34246,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To give his Old-World appetite new zest;
34247,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Yet still the New World spooked it in his veins,"
34248,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,A ghost he could not lay with all his pains;
34249,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,For never Pilgrims' offshoot scapes control
34250,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Of those old instincts that have shaped his soul.
34251,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A radical in thought, he puffed away"
34252,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"With shrewd contempt the dust of usage gray,         30"
34253,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Yet loathed democracy as one who saw,"
34254,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In what he longed to love, some vulgar flaw,"
34255,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And, shocked through all his delicate reserves,"
34256,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Remained a Tory by his taste and nerves,"
34257,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His fancy's thrall, he drew all ergoes thence,"
34258,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And thought himself the type of common sense;
34259,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Misliking women, not from cross or whim,"
34260,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But that his mother shared too much in him,"
34261,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And he half felt that what in them was grace
34262,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Made the unlucky weakness of his race.              40
34263,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"What powers he had he hardly cared to know,"
34264,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,But sauntered through the world as through a show;
34265,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A critic fine in his haphazard way,"
34266,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,A sort of mild La Bruyère on half-pay.
34267,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,For comic weaknesses he had an eye
34268,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Keen as an acid for an alkali,"
34269,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Yet you could feel, through his sardonic tone,"
34270,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He loved them all, unless they were his own."
34271,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"You might have called him, with his humorous twist,"
34272,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,A kind of human entomologist;     50
34273,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"As these bring home, from every walk they take,"
34274,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Their hat-crowns stuck with bugs of curious make,"
34275,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,So he filled all the lining of his head
34276,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"With characters impaled and ticketed,"
34277,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And had a cabinet behind his eyes
34278,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,For all they caught of mortal oddities.
34279,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,He might have been a poet--many worse--
34280,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But that he had, or feigned, contempt of verse;"
34281,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Called it tattooing language, and held rhymes"
34282,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The young world's lullaby of ruder times.     60
34283,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Bitter in words, too indolent for gall,"
34284,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He satirized himself the first of all,"
34285,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In men and their affairs could find no law,"
34286,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And was the ill logic that he thought he saw.
34287,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34288,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Scratching a match to light his pipe anew,"
34289,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,With eyes half shut some musing whiffs he drew
34290,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And thus began: 'I give you all my word,"
34291,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,I think this mock-Decameron absurd;
34292,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Boccaccio's garden! how bring that to pass

34294,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The moral east-wind of New England life

34298,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"These foreign plants are but half-hardy still,"

34304,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Why more exotics? Try your native vines,"
34305,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And in some thousand years you _may_ have wines;
34306,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Your present grapes are harsh, all pulps and skins,"
34307,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And want traditions of ancestral bins

34309,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Old lava fires, the sun-steeped hillside's hoard."
34310,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Without a Past, you lack that southern wall"
34311,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,O'er which the vines of Poesy should crawl;
34312,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Still they're your only hope: no midnight oil

34334,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And stories now, to suit a public nice,"

34429,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Its rough-barked darlings in a filial ring.
34430,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,But the great chimney was the central thought
34431,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Whose gravitation through the cluster wrought;
34432,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"For 'tis not styles far-fetched from Greece or Rome,"
34433,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But just the Fireside, that can make a home;"
34434,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"None of your spindling things of modern style,"
34435,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Like pins stuck through to stay the card-built pile,"
34436,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"It rose broad-shouldered, kindly, debonair,"
34437,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Its warm breath whitening in the October air,       210"
34438,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,While on its front a heart in outline showed
34439,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The place it filled in that serene abode.
34440,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34441,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,'When first I chanced the Eagle to explore.

34445,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Upon a third reposed a shirt-sleeved arm,"

34450,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Of his loose shirt there showed a brambly chest;
34451,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Streaked redly as a wind-foreboding morn,"
34452,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,His tanned cheeks curved to temples closely shorn;
34453,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Clean-shaved he was, save where a hedge of gray"

34459,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"No eye like his to value horse or cow,"
34460,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Or gauge the contents of a stack or mow;
34461,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He could foretell the weather at a word,"
34462,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He knew the haunt of every beast and bird,"
34463,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Or where a two-pound trout was sure to lie,"
34464,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Waiting the flutter of his homemade fly;
34465,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Nay, once in autumns five, he had the luck"
34466,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To drop at fair-play range a ten-tined buck;
34467,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Of sportsmen true he favored every whim,"
34468,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,But never cockney found a guide in him;             240

34470,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Not buzzing helpless in Reflection's mesh,"
34471,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Firm on its feet stood his broad-shouldered mind,"

34506,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In that sweet atmosphere of hazy blue,"
34507,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"So leisurely, so soothing, so forgiving,"
34508,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,That sometimes makes New England fit for living.
34509,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"I watched the landscape, erst so granite glum,"
34510,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Bloom like the south side of a ripening plum,      280"
34511,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And each rock-maple on the hillside make

34515,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Ah! there's a deal of sugar in the sun!
34516,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Tap me in Indian summer, I should run"
34517,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A juice to make rock-candy of,--but then"

34519,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34520,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"'There was a parlor in the house, a room"
34521,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To make you shudder with its prudish gloom.         290
34522,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"The furniture stood round with such an air,"
34523,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"There seemed an old maid's ghost in every chair,"
34524,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Which looked as it had scuttled to its place
34525,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And pulled extempore a Sunday face,"
34526,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Too smugly proper for a world of sin,"
34527,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Like boys on whom the minister comes in.
34528,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"The table, fronting you with icy stare,"
34529,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Strove to look witless that its legs were bare,"
34530,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,While the black sofa with its horse-hair pall

34532,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Each piece appeared to do its chilly best
34533,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"To seem an utter stranger to the rest,"
34534,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"As if acquaintanceship were deadly sin,"

34538,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"New England youth, that seems a sort of pill,"

34540,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Bitter to swallow, and which leaves a trace"
34541,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Of Calvinistic colic on the face.                   310
34542,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Between them, o'er the mantel, hung in state"

34544,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Invention pure, but meant, we may presume,"
34545,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To give some Scripture sanction to the room.

34548,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Devoted to some memory long ago

34551,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Though none e'er dared an entrance who were wise,     320"
34552,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And bushed asparagus in fading green
34553,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Added its shiver to the franklin clean.
34554,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34555,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"'When first arrived, I chilled a half-hour there,"
34556,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Nor dared deflower with use a single chair;
34557,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"I caught no cold, yet flying pains could find"
34558,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"For weeks in me,--a rheumatism of mind."
34559,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,One thing alone imprisoned there had power
34560,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To hold me in the place that long half-hour:
34561,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A scutcheon this, a helm-surmounted shield,"
34562,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Three griffins argent on a sable field;             330
34563,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A relic of the shipwrecked past was here,"
34564,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And Ezra held some Old-World lumber dear.
34565,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Nay, do not smile; I love this kind of thing,"
34566,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"These cooped traditions with a broken wing,"
34567,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"This freehold nook in Fancy's pipe-blown ball,"
34568,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,This less than nothing that is more than all!
34569,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Have I not seen sweet natures kept alive
34570,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Amid the humdrum of your business hive,"
34571,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Undowered spinsters shielded from all harms,"
34572,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,By airy incomes from a coat of arms?'               340
34573,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34574,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He paused a moment, and his features took"
34575,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The flitting sweetness of that inward look
34576,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"I hinted at before; but, scarcely seen,"
34577,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"It shrank for shelter 'neath his harder mien,"
34578,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And, rapping his black pipe of ashes clear,"
34579,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,He went on with a self-derisive sneer:
34580,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"'No doubt we make a part of God's design,"
34581,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And break the forest-path for feet divine;
34582,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To furnish foothold for this grand prevision
34583,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Is good, and yet--to be the mere transition,        350"
34584,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"That, you will say, is also good, though I"
34585,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Scarce like to feed the ogre By-and-By.
34586,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Raw edges rasp my nerves; my taste is wooed
34587,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"By things that are, not going to be, good,"
34588,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Though were I what I dreamed two lustres gone,"
34589,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"I'd stay to help the Consummation on,"
34590,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Whether a new Rome than the old more fair,"
34591,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Or a deadflat of rascal-ruled despair;
34592,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,But _my_ skull somehow never closed the suture
34593,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"That seems to knit yours firmly with the future,     360"
34594,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,So you'll excuse me if I'm sometimes fain
34595,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,To tie the Past's warm nightcap o'er my brain;
34596,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"I'm quite aware 'tis not in fashion here,"
34597,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,But then your northeast winds are _so_ severe!
34598,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34599,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,'But to my story: though 'tis truly naught
34600,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But a few hints in Memory's sketchbook caught,"
34601,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And which may claim a value on the score
34602,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Of calling back some scenery now no more.
34603,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Shall I confess? The tavern's only Lar
34604,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Seemed (be not shocked!) its homely-featured bar.     370
34605,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Here dozed a fire of beechen logs, that bred"
34606,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Strange fancies in its embers golden-red,"
34607,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And nursed the loggerhead whose hissing dip,"
34608,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Timed by nice instinct, creamed the mug of flip"
34609,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"That made from mouth to mouth its genial round,"
34610,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Nor left one nature wholly winter-bound;
34611,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Hence dropt the tinkling coal all mellow-ripe
34612,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,For Uncle Reuben's talk-extinguished pipe;
34613,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Hence rayed the heat, as from an indoor sun,"
34614,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,That wooed forth many a shoot of rustic fun.        380
34615,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Here Ezra ruled as king by right divine;
34616,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"No other face had such a wholesome shine,"
34617,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,No laugh like his so full of honest cheer;
34618,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Above the rest it crowed like Chanticleer.
34619,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,
34620,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"'In this one room his dame you never saw,"
34621,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Where reigned by custom old a Salic law;
34622,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Here coatless lolled he on his throne of oak,"
34623,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And every tongue paused midway if he spoke.
34624,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Due mirth he loved, yet was his sway severe;"

34631,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The same that gypsy Nature owns for hers:
34632,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Loose-ended souls, whose skills bring scanty gold,"
34633,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And whom the poor-house catches when they're old;
34634,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Rude country-minstrels, men who doctor kine,"
34635,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Or graft, and, out of scions ten, save nine;        400"
34636,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Creatures of genius they, but never meant"
34637,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"To keep step with the civic regiment,"
34638,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"These Ezra welcomed, feeling in his mind"
34639,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Perhaps some motions of the vagrant kind;

34643,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,With solemn face a visionary score.
34644,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,This thawed to life in Uncle Reuben's throat
34645,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A torpid shoal of jest and anecdote,                410"
34646,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Like those queer fish that doze the droughts away,"
34647,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And wait for moisture, wrapped in sun-baked clay;"
34648,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"This warmed the one-eyed fiddler to his task,"
34649,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Perched in the corner on an empty cask,"
34650,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"By whose shrill art rapt suddenly, some boor"

34656,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In dribbling monologue 'twixt whiffs and sips,      420"
34657,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,The story I so long have tried to tell;

34662,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Soiled though she be and lost to maidenhood.
34663,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Quompegan is a town some ten miles south
34664,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"From Jethro, at Nagumscot river-mouth,"

34673,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In business strict, to bring the balance true"
34674,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"He had been known to bite a fig in two,"
34675,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,And change a board-nail for a shingle-nail.
34676,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"All that he had he ready held for sale,             440"
34677,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His house, his tomb, whate'er the law allows,"

34679,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His one ambition still to get and get,"

34681,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His store looked righteous, should the Parson come,"
34682,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"But in a dark back-room he peddled rum,"
34683,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And eased Ma'am Conscience, if she e'er would scold,"
34684,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,By christening it with water ere he sold.
34685,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"A small, dry man he was, who wore a queue,"
34686,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"And one white neckcloth all the week-days through,--      450"
34687,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"On Monday white, by Saturday as dun"
34688,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,As that worn homeward by the prodigal son.
34689,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His frosted earlocks, striped with foxy brown,"
34690,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,Were braided up to hide a desert crown;
34691,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"His coat was brownish, black perhaps of yore;"

34701,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Wherein a constant snuffle you might hear,"
34702,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,As if with him 'twere winter all the year.
34703,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"At pew-head sat he with decorous pains,"
34704,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"In sermon-time could foot his weekly gains,"
34705,FITZ ADAM'S STORY,"Or, with closed eyes and heaven-abstracted air,"

35031,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,Giving Eve a due sense of her crime.
35032,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,
35033,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,I have seen him some poor ancient thrashing
35034,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,"Into something (God save us!) more dry,"
35035,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,With the Water of Life itself washing
35036,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,"The life out of earth, sea, and sky."

35038,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,"O dread fellow-mortal, get newer"
35039,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,"Despatches to carry, or none!"
35040,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,We're as quick as the Greek and the Jew were
35041,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,At knowing a loaf from a stone.
35042,THE FLYING DUTCHMAN,

35051,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35052,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"O days endeared to every Muse,"
35053,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"When nobody had any Views,"
35054,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Nor, while the cloudscape of his mind"
35055,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"By every breeze was new designed,"
35056,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Insisted all the world should see
35057,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Camels or whales where none there be!
35058,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"O happy days, when men received"
35059,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"From sire to son what all believed,"
35060,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And left the other world in bliss,"
35061,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Too busy with bedevilling this!                     10
35062,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35063,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Beset by doubts of every breed
35064,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"In the last bastion of my creed,"
35065,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"With shot and shell for Sabbath-chime,"
35066,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"I watch the storming-party climb,"
35067,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Panting (their prey in easy reach),"
35068,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,To pour triumphant through the breach
35069,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,In walls that shed like snowflakes tons
35070,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Of missiles from old-fashioned guns,"
35071,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,But crumble 'neath the storm that pours
35072,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,All day and night from bigger bores.                20
35073,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"There, as I hopeless watch and wait"
35074,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"The last life-crushing coil of Fate,"
35075,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Despair finds solace in the praise
35076,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Of those serene dawn-rosy days
35077,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Ere microscopes had made us heirs
35078,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"To large estates of doubts and snares,"
35079,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"By proving that the title-deeds,"
35080,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Once all-sufficient for men's needs,"
35081,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Are palimpsests that scarce disguise
35082,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"The tracings of still earlier lies,                30"
35083,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Themselves as surely written o'er
35084,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,An older fib erased before.
35085,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35086,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,So from these days I fly to those
35087,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"That in the landlocked Past repose,"
35088,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Where no rude wind of doctrine shakes
35089,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,From bloom-flushed boughs untimely flakes;
35090,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Where morning's eyes see nothing strange,"
35091,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"No crude perplexity of change,"
35092,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And morrows trip along their ways
35093,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Secure as happy yesterdays.                        40
35094,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Then there were rulers who could trace
35095,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Through heroes up to gods their race,"
35096,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Pledged to fair fame and noble use
35097,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"By veins from Odin filled or Zeus,"
35098,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And under bonds to keep divine
35099,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The praise of a celestial line.
35100,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Then priests could pile the altar's sods,"
35101,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"With whom gods spake as they with gods,"
35102,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And everywhere from haunted earth
35103,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Broke springs of wonder, that had birth            50"
35104,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,In depths divine beyond the ken
35105,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And fatal scrutiny of men;
35106,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Then hills and groves and streams and seas
35107,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Thrilled with immortal presences,"
35108,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Not too ethereal for the scope
35109,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Of human passion's dream or hope.
35110,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35111,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Now Pan at last is surely dead,"
35112,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And King No-Credit reigns instead,"
35113,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Whose officers, morosely strict,"
35114,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Poor Fancy's tenantry evict,                        60"
35115,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Chase the last Genius from the door,"
35116,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And nothing dances any more.
35117,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Nothing? Ah, yes, our tables do,"
35118,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Dramming the Old One's own tattoo,"
35119,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And, if the oracles are dumb,"
35120,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Have we not mediums! Why be glum?
35121,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35122,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Fly thither? Why, the very air"
35123,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Is full of hindrance and despair!
35124,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Fly thither? But I cannot fly;
35125,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"My doubts enmesh me if I try,                       70"
35126,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Each Liliputian, but, combined,"
35127,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Potent a giant's limbs to bind.
35128,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,This world and that are growing dark;
35129,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"A huge interrogation mark,"
35130,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The Devil's crook episcopal.
35131,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Still borne before him since the Fall,"
35132,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Blackens with its ill-omened sign
35133,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The old blue heaven of faith benign.
35134,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Whence? Whither? Wherefore? How? Which? Why?
35135,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"All ask at once, all wait reply.                    80"
35136,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Men feel old systems cracking under 'em;
35137,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Life saddens to a mere conundrum
35138,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Which once Religion solved, but she"
35139,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Has lost--has Science found?--the key.
35140,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35141,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"What was snow-bearded Odin, trow,"
35142,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"The mighty hunter long ago,"
35143,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Whose horn and hounds the peasant hears
35144,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Still when the Northlights shake their spears?
35145,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Science hath answers twain, I've heard;"
35146,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Choose which you will, nor hope a third;            90"
35147,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Whichever box the truth be stowed in,"
35148,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,There's not a sliver left of Odin.
35149,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Either he was a pinchbrowed thing,"
35150,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"With scarcely wit a stone to fling,"
35151,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,A creature both in size and shape
35152,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Nearer than we are to the ape,"
35153,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Who hung sublime with brat and spouse
35154,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"By tail prehensile from the boughs,"
35155,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And, happier than his maimed descendants,"
35156,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"The culture-curtailed _in_dependents,          100"
35157,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Could pluck his cherries with both paws,"
35158,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And stuff with both his big-boned jaws;
35159,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Or else the core his name enveloped
35160,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Was from a solar myth developed,"
35161,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Which, hunted to its primal shoot,"
35162,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Takes refuge in a Sanskrit root,"
35163,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Thereby to instant death explaining
35164,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The little poetry remaining.
35165,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35166,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Try it with Zeus, 'tis just the same;"
35167,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"The thing evades, we hug a name;                   110"
35168,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Nay, scarcely that,--perhaps a vapor"
35169,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Born of some atmospheric caper.
35170,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,All Lempriere's fables blur together
35171,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"In cloudy symbols of the weather,"
35172,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And Aphrodite rose from frothy seas
35173,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,But to illustrate such hypotheses.
35174,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"With years enough behind his back,"
35175,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Lincoln will take the selfsame track,"
35176,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And prove, hulled fairly to the cob,"
35177,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,A mere vagary of Old Prob.                          120
35178,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Give the right man a solar myth,"
35179,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And he'll confute the sun therewith.
35180,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35181,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"They make things admirably plain,"
35182,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,But one hard question _will_ remain:
35183,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"If one hypothesis you lose,"
35184,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Another in its place you choose,"
35185,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"But, your faith gone, O man and brother,"
35186,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Whose shop shall furnish you another?
35187,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"One that will wash, I mean, and wear,"
35188,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And wrap us warmly from despair?                   130
35189,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"While they are clearing up our puzzles,"
35190,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And clapping prophylactic muzzles
35191,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,On the Actæon's hounds that sniff
35192,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Our devious track through But and If,"
35193,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Would they'd explain away the Devil
35194,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"And other facts that won't keep level,"
35195,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"But rise beneath our feet or fail,"
35196,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,A reeling ship's deck in a gale!
35197,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"God vanished long ago, iwis,"
35198,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,A mere subjective synthesis;                       140
35199,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"A doll, stuffed out with hopes and fears,"
35200,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Too homely for us pretty dears,"
35201,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Who want one that conviction carries,"
35202,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Last make of London or of Paris.
35203,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"He gone, I felt a moment's spasm,"
35204,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"But calmed myself, with Protoplasm,"
35205,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"A finer name, and, what is more,"
35206,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,As enigmatic as before;
35207,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Greek, too, and sure to fill with ease"
35208,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Minds caught in the Symplegades                    150
35209,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Of soul and sense, life's two conditions,"
35210,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Each baffled with its own omniscience.
35211,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The men who labor to revise
35212,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Our Bibles will, I hope, be wise,"
35213,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And print it without foolish qualms
35214,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Instead of God in David's psalms:
35215,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Noll had been more effective far
35216,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Could he have shouted at Dunbar,"
35217,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"'Rise, Protoplasm!' No dourest Scot"
35218,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Had waited for another shot.                       160
35219,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35220,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And yet I frankly must confess
35221,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"A secret unforgivingness,"
35222,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And shudder at the saving chrism
35223,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Whose best New Birth is Pessimism;
35224,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,My soul--I mean the bit of phosphorus
35225,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,That fills the place of what that was for us--
35226,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Can't bid its inward bores defiance
35227,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,With the new nursery-tales of science.
35228,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"What profits me, though doubt by doubt,"
35229,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"As nail by nail, be driven out,                    170"
35230,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"When every new one, like the last,"
35231,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Still holds my coffin-lid as fast?
35232,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Would I find thought a moment's truce,"
35233,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Give me the young world's Mother Goose
35234,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"With life and joy in every limb,"
35235,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,The chimney-corner tales of Grimm!
35236,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35237,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Our dear and admirable Huxley
35238,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Cannot explain to me why ducks lay,"
35239,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Or, rather, how into their eggs"
35240,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Blunder potential wings and legs                   180
35241,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,With will to move them and decide
35242,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Whether in air or lymph to glide.
35243,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Who gets a hair's-breadth on by showing
35244,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,That Something Else set all agoing?
35245,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Farther and farther back we push
35246,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,From Moses and his burning bush;
35247,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Cry, 'Art Thou there?' Above, below,"
35248,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,All Nature mutters _yes_ and _no!_
35249,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,'Tis the old answer: we're agreed
35250,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Being from Being must proceed,                      190"
35251,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Life be Life's source. I might as well
35252,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Obey the meeting-house's bell,"
35253,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And listen while Old Hundred pours
35254,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Forth through the summer-opened doors,"
35255,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"From old and young. I hear it yet,"
35256,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Swelled by bass-viol and clarinet,"
35257,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"While the gray minister, with face"
35258,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Radiant, let loose his noble bass."
35259,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"If Heaven it reached not, yet its roll"
35260,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Waked all the echoes of the soul,                   200"
35261,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And in it many a life found wings
35262,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,To soar away from sordid things.
35263,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Church gone and singers too, the song"
35264,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Sings to me voiceless all night long,"
35265,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Till my soul beckons me afar,"
35266,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Glowing and trembling like a star.
35267,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Will any scientific touch
35268,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,With my worn strings achieve as much?
35269,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,
35270,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"I don't object, not I, to know"

35272,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,I touch my ear's collusive tip
35273,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,And own the poor-relationship.
35274,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,That apes of various shapes and sizes
35275,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Contained their germs that all the prizes
35276,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,"Of senate, pulpit, camp, and bar win"
35277,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,May give us hopes that sweeten Darwin.
35278,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,Who knows but from our loins may spring
35279,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,(Long hence) some winged sweet-throated thing
35280,CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE,As much superior to us

35310,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"The world turns mild; democracy, they say,"
35311,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Rounds the sharp knobs of character away,"
35312,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"And no great harm, unless at grave expense"
35313,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Of what needs edge of proof, the moral sense;"
35314,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,For man or race is on the downward path
35315,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Whose fibre grows too soft for honest wrath,"
35316,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And there's a subtle influence that springs
35317,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,From words to modify our sense of things.
35318,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,A plain distinction grows obscure of late:
35319,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Man, if he will, may pardon; but the State           10"
35320,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Forgets its function if not fixed as Fate.
35321,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"So thought our sires: a hundred years ago,"
35322,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"If men were knaves, why, people called them so,"
35323,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And crime could see the prison-portal bend
35324,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Its brow severe at no long vista's end.
35325,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,In those days for plain things plain words would serve;
35326,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Men had not learned to admire the graceful swerve
35327,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Wherewith the Æsthetic Nature's genial mood
35328,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Makes public duty slope to private good;
35329,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,No muddled conscience raised the saving doubt;       20
35330,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"A soldier proved unworthy was drummed out,"
35331,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"An officer cashiered, a civil servant"
35332,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,(No matter though his piety were fervent)
35333,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Disgracefully dismissed, and through the land"
35334,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Each bore for life a stigma from the brand
35335,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Whose far-heard hiss made others more averse
35336,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,To take the facile step from bad to worse.
35337,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"The Ten Commandments had a meaning then,"
35338,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Felt in their bones by least considerate men,"
35339,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Because behind them Public Conscience stood,         30"
35340,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And without wincing made their mandates good.
35341,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,But now that 'Statesmanship' is just a way
35342,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"To dodge the primal curse and make it pay,"
35343,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Since office means a kind of patent drill
35344,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"To force an entrance to the Nation's till,"
35345,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And peculation something rather less
35346,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Risky than if you spelt it with an _s_;
35347,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Now that to steal by law is grown an art,"
35348,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Whom rogues the sires, their milder sons call smart,"
35349,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And 'slightly irregular' dilutes the shame           40
35350,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Of what had once a somewhat blunter name.
35351,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,With generous curve we draw the moral line:
35352,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Our swindlers are permitted to resign;
35353,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Their guilt is wrapped in deferential names,"
35354,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And twenty sympathize for one that blames.
35355,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Add national disgrace to private crime,"
35356,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Confront mankind with brazen front sublime,"
35357,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Steal but enough, the world is un-severe,--"
35358,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Tweed is a statesman, Fisk a financier;"
35359,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Invent a mine, and he--the Lord knows what;          50"
35360,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Secure, at any rate, with what you've got."
35361,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"The public servant who has stolen or lied,"
35362,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"If called on, may resign with honest pride:"
35363,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"As unjust favor put him in, why doubt"
35364,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Disfavor as unjust has turned him out?
35365,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Even it indicted, what is that but fudge"
35366,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,To him who counted-in the elective judge?
35367,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Whitewashed, he quits the politician's strife"
35368,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"At ease in mind, with pockets filled for life;"
35369,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,His 'lady' glares with gems whose vulgar blaze       60
35370,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"The poor man through his heightened taxes pays,"
35371,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Himself content if one huge Kohinoor
35372,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Bulge from a shirt-front ampler than before,"
35373,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"But not too candid, lest it haply tend"
35374,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,To rouse suspicion of the People's Friend.
35375,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"A public meeting, treated at his cost,"
35376,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Resolves him back more virtue than he lost;
35377,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,With character regilt he counts his gains;
35378,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"What's gone was air, the solid good remains;"
35379,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"For what is good, except what friend and foe         70"
35380,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Seem quite unanimous in thinking so,"
35381,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"The stocks and bonds which, in our age of loans,"
35382,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,Replace the stupid pagan's stocks and stones?
35383,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"With choker white, wherein no cynic eye"
35384,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Dares see idealized a hempen tie,"
35385,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"At parish-meetings he conducts in prayer,"
35386,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And pays for missions to be sent elsewhere;
35387,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"On 'Change respected, to his friends endeared,"
35388,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,"Add but a Sunday-school class, he's revered,"
35389,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,And his too early tomb will not be dumb              80
35390,TEMPORA MUTANTUR,To point a moral for our youth to come.

36058,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"In secrecies of unprobed space,"

36073,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Into our own, past hearing, seeing,"
36074,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"As men, if once attempered so,"

36076,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,As horses with an instant thrill
36077,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Measure their rider's strength of will?             30
36078,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Comes not to all some glimpse that brings
36079,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Strange sense of sense-escaping things?
36080,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Wraiths some transfigured nerve divines?
36081,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Approaches, premonitions, signs,"

36100,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,The spell of this illusion be
36101,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,That witches us to hear and see
36102,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"As in a twi-life what it will,"
36103,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,And hath such wonder-working skill
36104,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,That what we deemed most solid-wrought
36105,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Turns a mere figment of our thought,"
36106,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Which when we grasp at in despair
36107,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Our fingers find vain semblance there,"

36155,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Silent as meditation is.
36156,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,With a half-humorous smile I see
36157,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"In this their aimless industry,"

36201,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Scarcely more fragile than our own,                 150"
36202,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Where you have all a whale could wish,"
36203,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Happy as Eden's primal fish.

36205,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"From some kind heaven not far away,"
36206,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"And still you snatch its softening crumbs,"
36207,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Nor, more than we, think whence it comes."
36208,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,No toil seems yours but to explore
36209,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Your cloistered realm from shore to shore;

36222,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Like that of conscience in the dark,"
36223,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Seems to make me its single mark.
36224,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,What a benignant lot is yours

36242,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"But to stir argument, and tease                     190"
36243,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,My thought with all the ghostly shapes
36244,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,From which no moody man escapes.
36245,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Diminished creature, I no more"

36250,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"I watch you in your crystal sphere,"
36251,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,And wonder if you see and hear
36252,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Those shapes and sounds that stir the wide
36253,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Conjecture of the world outside;                    200
36254,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"In your pent lives, as we in ours,"

36283,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"If lesson none, an image, then,"
36284,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Impeaching self-conceit in men                      230
36285,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Who put their confidence alone
36286,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,In what they call the Seen and Known.
36287,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,How seen? How known? As through your glass
36288,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Our wavering apparitions pass
36289,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"Perplexingly, then subtly wrought"
36290,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,To some quite other thing by thought.

36293,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,Is haply wholesomer for eyes
36294,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,"That cheat us to be overwise,                       240"
36295,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,And I am happy in my right
36296,HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES,To love God's darkness as His light.

36712,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,person singular of the personal pronoun. Let each of the good-natured
36713,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,unknown who have cheered me by the written communication of their
36714,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,sympathy look upon this Introduction as a private letter to himself.
36715,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
36716,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"When, more than twenty years ago, I wrote the first of the series, I had"
36717,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,no definite plan and no intention of ever writing another. Thinking the

36719,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of Slavery, our common sin, and wishing to put the feeling of those who"
36720,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"thought as I did in a way that would tell, I imagined to myself such an"
36721,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,up-country man as I had often seen at antislavery gatherings capable of
36722,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"district-school English, but always instinctively falling back into the"
36723,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,natural stronghold of his homely dialect when heated to the point of
36724,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,self-forgetfulness. When I began to carry out my conception and to write
36725,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in my assumed character, I found myself in a strait between two perils."
36726,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"On the one hand, I was in danger of being carried beyond the limit of my"
36727,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"own opinions, or at least of that temper with which every man should"
36728,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"speak his mind in print, and on the other I feared the risk of seeming"
36729,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,to vulgarize a deep and sacred conviction. I needed on occasion to rise
36730,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"above the level of mere _patois_, and for this purpose conceived the"
36731,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Rev. Mr. Wilbur, who should express the more cautious element of the New"
36732,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"England character and its pedantry, as Mr. Biglow should serve for its"
36733,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,homely common-sense vivified and heated by conscience. The parson was to
36734,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"be the complement rather than the antithesis of his parishioner, and I"
36735,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,felt or fancied a certain humorous element in the real identity of the
36736,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,two under a seeming incongruity. Mr. Wilbur's fondness for scraps of
36737,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Latin, though drawn from the life, I adopted deliberately to heighten"
36738,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the contrast. Finding soon after that I needed some one as a mouth-piece
36739,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of the mere drollery, for I conceive that true humor is never divorced"
36740,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"from moral conviction, I invented Mr. Sawin for the clown of my little"
36741,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,puppet-show. I meant to embody in him that half-conscious _un_morality
36742,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,which I had noticed as the recoil in gross natures from a puritanism
36743,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,that still strove to keep in its creed the intense savor which had long
36744,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,gone out of its faith and life. In the three I thought I should find
36745,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"room enough to express, as it was my plan to do, the popular feeling and"
36746,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"opinion of the time. For the names of two of my characters, since I have"
36747,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,received some remonstrances from very worthy persons who happen to bear
36748,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"them, I would say that they were purely fortuitous, probably mere"
36749,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,unconscious memories of sign-boards or directories. Mr. Sawin's sprang
36750,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"from the accident of a rhyme at the end of his first epistle, and I"
36751,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,purposely christened him by the impossible surname of Birdofredum not
36752,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"more to stigmatize him as the incarnation of 'Manifest Destiny,' in"
36753,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"other words, of national recklessness as to right and wrong, than to"
36754,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,avoid the chance of wounding any private sensitiveness.
36755,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
36756,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"The success of my experiment soon began not only to astonish me, but to"
36757,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,make me feel the responsibility of knowing that I held in my hand a
36758,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,weapon instead of the mere fencing-stick I had supposed. Very far from
36759,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"being a popular author under my own name, so far, indeed, as to be"
36760,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"almost unread, I found the verses of my pseudonym copied everywhere; saw"
36761,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,them pinned up in workshops; I heard them quoted and their authorship
36762,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"debated; I once even, when rumor had at length caught up my name in one"
36763,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of its eddies, had the satisfaction of overhearing it demonstrated, in"
36764,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the pauses of a concert, that _I_ was utterly incompetent to have"
36765,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,written anything of the kind. I had read too much not to know the utter
36766,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"worthlessness of contemporary reputation, especially as regards satire,"
36767,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,but I knew also that by giving a certain amount of influence it also had
36768,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"its worth, if that influence were used on the right side. I had learned,"
36769,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"too, that the first requisite of good writing is to have an earnest and"
36770,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"definite purpose, whether æsthetic or moral, and that even good"
36771,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"writing, to please long, must have more than an average amount either of"
36772,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,imagination or common-sense. The first of these falls to the lot of
36773,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,scarcely one in several generations; the last is within the reach of
36774,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,many in every one that passes; and of this an author may fairly hope to
36775,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,become in part the mouthpiece. If I put on the cap and bells and made
36776,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"myself one of the court-fools of King Demos, it was less to make his"
36777,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,majesty laugh than to win a passage to his royal ears for certain
36778,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,serious things which I had deeply at heart. I say this because there is
36779,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,no imputation that could be more galling to any man's self-respect than
36780,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"that of being a mere jester. I endeavored, by generalising my satire, to"
36781,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,give it what value _I_ could beyond the passing moment and the immediate
36782,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"application. How far I have succeeded I cannot tell, but I have had"
36783,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,better luck than I ever looked for in seeing my verses survive to pass
36784,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,beyond their nonage.
36785,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
36786,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"In choosing the Yankee dialect, I did not act without forethought. It"
36787,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,had long seemed to me that the great vice of American writing and
36788,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"speaking was a studied want of simplicity, that we were in danger of"
36789,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"coming to look on our mother-tongue as a dead language, to be sought in"
36790,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the grammar and dictionary rather than in the heart, and that our only"
36791,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,chance of escape was by seeking it at its living sources among those who
36792,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"were, as Scottowe says of Major-General Gibbons, 'divinely illiterate.'"
36793,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"President Lincoln, the only really great public man whom these latter"
36794,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"days have seen, was great also in this, that he was master--witness his"
36795,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"speech at Gettysburg--of a truly masculine English, classic, because it"
36796,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"was of no special period, and level at once to the highest and lowest of"
36797,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,his countrymen. I learn from the highest authority that his favorite
36798,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"reading was in Shakespeare and Milton, to which, of course, the Bible"
36799,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,should be added. But whoever should read the debates in Congress might
36800,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,fancy himself present at a meeting of the city council of some city of
36801,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Southern Gaul in the decline of the Empire, where barbarians with a"
36802,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Latin varnish emulated each other in being more than Ciceronian. Whether
36803,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"it be want of culture, for the highest outcome of that is simplicity, or"
36804,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"for whatever reason, it is certain that very few American writers or"
36805,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"speakers wield their native language with the directness, precision, and"
36806,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,force that are common as the day in the mother country. We use it like
36807,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Scotsmen, not as if it belonged to us, but as if we wished to prove that"
36808,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"we belonged to it, by showing our intimacy with its written rather than"
36809,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,with its spoken dialect. And yet all the while our popular idiom is racy
36810,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"with life and vigor and originality, bucksome (as Milton used the word)"
36811,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to our new occasions, and proves itself no mere graft by sending up new"
36812,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,suckers from the old root in spite of us. It is only from its roots in
36813,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the living generations of men that a language can be reinforced with
36814,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,fresh vigor for its needs; what may be called a literate dialect grows
36815,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"ever more and more pedantic and foreign, till it becomes at last as"
36816,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,unfitting a vehicle for living thought as monkish Latin. That we should
36817,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,all be made to talk like books is the danger with which we are
36818,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"threatened by the Universal Schoolmaster, who does his best to enslave"
36819,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the minds and memories of his victims to what he esteems the best models
36820,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of English composition, that is to say, to the writers whose style is"
36821,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,faultily correct and has no blood-warmth in it. No language after it has

36823,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"secreted for it in the rich mother-earth of common folk, can bring forth"

36829,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"fancy, and imagination, which has suffered an earth-change, that the"
36830,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"vocal forest, as Howell called it, may clothe itself anew with living"
36831,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"green. There is death in the dictionary; and, where language is too"
36832,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"strictly limited by convention, the ground for expression to grow in is"
36833,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"limited also; and we get a _potted_ literature, Chinese dwarfs"

36927,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
36928,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,In one sense this is nothing new. The school of Pope in verse ended by
36929,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,wire-drawing its phrase to such thinness that it could bear no weight of
36930,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,meaning whatever. Nor is fine writing by any means confined to America.
36931,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,All writers without imagination fall into it of necessity whenever they
36932,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,attempt the figurative. I take two examples from Mr. Merivale's 'History
36933,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of the Romans under the Empire,' which, indeed, is full of such. 'The"
36934,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,last years of the age familiarly styled the Augustan were singularly
36935,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,barren of the literary glories from which its celebrity was chiefly
36936,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,derived. One by one the stars in its firmament had been lost to the
36937,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"world; Virgil and Horace, etc., had long since died; the charm which the"
36938,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,imagination of Livy had thrown over the earlier annals of Rome had
36939,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,ceased to shine on the details of almost contemporary history; and if
36940,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the flood of his eloquence still continued flowing, we can hardly"
36941,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"suppose that the stream was as rapid, as fresh, and as clear as ever.' I"
36942,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,will not waste time in criticising the bad English or the mixture of
36943,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"metaphor in these sentences, but will simply cite another from the same"
36944,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,author which is even worse. 'The shadowy phantom of the Republic
36945,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"continued to flit before the eyes of the Cæsar. There was still, he"
36946,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"apprehended, a germ of sentiment existing, on which a scion of his own"
36947,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"house, or even a stranger, might boldly throw himself and raise the"
36948,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"standard of patrician independence.' Now a ghost may haunt a murderer,"
36949,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"but hardly, I should think, to scare him with the threat of taking a new"
36950,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,lease of its old tenement. And fancy the _scion_ of a _house_ in the act
36951,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,of _throwing itself_ upon a _germ of sentiment_ to _raise a standard!_ I
36952,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"am glad, since we have so much in the same kind to answer for, that this"
36953,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,bit of horticultural rhetoric is from beyond sea. I would not be
36954,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,supposed to condemn truly imaginative prose. There is a simplicity of
36955,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"splendor, no less than of plainness, and prose would be poor indeed if"
36956,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,it could not find a tongue for that meaning of the mind which is behind
36957,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the meaning of the words. It has sometimes seemed to me that in England
36958,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,there was a growing tendency to curtail language into a mere
36959,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"convenience, and to defecate it of all emotion as thoroughly as"
36960,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"algebraic signs. This has arisen, no doubt, in part from that healthy"
36961,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"national contempt of humbug which is characteristic of Englishmen, in"
36962,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,part from that sensitiveness to the ludicrous which makes them so shy of
36963,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"expressing feeling, but in part also, it is to be feared, from a growing"
36964,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"distrust, one might almost say hatred, of whatever is super-material."
36965,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,There is something sad in the scorn with which their journalists treat
36966,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the notion of there being such a thing as a national ideal, seeming"
36967,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,utterly to have forgotten that even in the affairs of this world the
36968,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,imagination is as much matter-of-fact as the understanding. If we were
36969,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,to trust the impression made on us by some of the cleverest and most
36970,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"characteristic of their periodical literature, we should think England"
36971,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,hopelessly stranded on the good-humored cynicism of well-to-do
36972,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"middle-age, and should fancy it an enchanted nation, doomed to sit"
36973,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,forever with its feet under the mahogany in that after-dinner mood which
36974,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"follows conscientious repletion, and which it is ill-manners to disturb"
36975,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,with any topics more exciting than the quality of the wines. But there
36976,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,are already symptoms that a large class of Englishmen are getting weary
36977,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of the dominion of consols and divine common-sense, and to believe that"
36978,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"eternal three per cent. is not the chief end of man, nor the highest and"
36979,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,only kind of interest to which the powers and opportunities of England
36980,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,are entitled.
36981,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
36982,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,The quality of exaggeration has often been remarked on as typical of
36983,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"American character, and especially o£ American humor. In Dr. Petri's"
36984,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_Gedrängtes Handbuch der Fremdwörter_, we are told that the word"
36985,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_humbug_ is commonly used for the exaggerations of the North-Americans.
36986,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"To be sure, one would be tempted to think the dream of Columbus half"
36987,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"fulfilled, and that Europe had found in the West a nearer way to"
36988,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Orientalism, at least in diction. But it seems to me that a great deal"
36989,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,of what is set down as mere extravagance is more fitly to be called
36990,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"intensity and picturesqueness, symptoms ol the imaginative faculty in"
36991,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"full health and strength, though producing, as yet, only the raw and"
36992,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"formless material in which poetry is to work. By and by, perhaps, the"
36993,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"world will see it fashioned into poem and picture, and Europe, which"
36994,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"will be hard pushed for originality erelong, may have to thank us for a"
36995,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,new sensation. The French continue to find Shakespeare exaggerated
36996,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,because he treated English just as our country-folk do when they speak
36997,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of a 'steep price,' or say that they 'freeze to' a thing. The first"
36998,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,postulate of an original literature is that a people should use their
36999,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"language instinctively and unconsciously, as if it were a lively part of"
37000,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"their growth and personality, not as the mere torpid boon of education"
37001,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,or inheritance. Even Burns contrived to write very poor verse and prose
37002,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,in English. Vulgarisms are often only poetry in the egg. The late Mr.
37003,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Horace Mann, in one of his public addresses, commented at some length on"
37004,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the beauty and moral significance ol the French phrase _s'orienter_ and
37005,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,called on his young friends to practise upon it in life. There was not a
37006,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Yankee in his audience whose problem had not always been to find out
37007,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"what was _about east_, and to shape his course accordingly. This charm"
37008,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"which a familiar expression gains by being commented, as it were, and."
37009,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"set in a new light by a foreign language, is curious and instructive. I"
37010,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,cannot help thinking that Mr. Matthew Arnold forgets this a little too
37011,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,much sometimes when he writes of the beauties of French style. It would
37012,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,not be hard to find in the works of French Academicians phrases as
37013,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"coarse as those he cites from Burke, only they are veiled by the"
37014,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"unfamiliarity of the language. But, however this may be, it is certain"
37015,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,that poets and peasants please us in the same way by translating words

37025,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,have taken on myself is that of the humbler bird.
37026,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37027,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,But it is affirmed that there is something innately vulgar in the Yankee
37028,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"dialect. M. Sainte-Beuve says, with his usual neatness: '_Je définis un"

37032,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Tuscan before Dante had lifted it into a classic, and neither, it seems"
37033,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to me, will quite fit a _patois/_, which is not properly a dialect, but"
37034,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"rather certain archaisms, proverbial phrases, and modes of"
37035,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"pronunciation, which maintain themselves among the uneducated side by"
37036,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"side with the finished and universally accepted language. Norman French,"
37037,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"for example, or Scotch down to the time of James VI., could hardly be"
37038,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"called _patois_, while I should be half inclined to name the Yankee a"
37039,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_lingo_ rather than a dialect. It has retained a few words now fallen
37040,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"into disuse in the mother country, like to _tarry_, to _progress_,"
37041,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_fleshy_, _fall_, and some others; it has changed the meaning of some,"
37042,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,as in _freshet_; and it has clung to what I suspect to have been the
37043,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,broad Norman pronunciation of _e_ (which Molière puts into the mouth of
37044,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"his rustics) in such words as _sarvant_, _parfect_, _vartoo_, and the"
37045,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,like. It maintains something of the French sound of _a_ also in words
37046,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"like _chămber_, _dănger_ (though the latter had certainly begun to"
37047,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"take its present sound so early as 1636, when I find it sometimes spelt"
37048,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_dainger_). But in general it may be said that nothing can be found in
37049,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,it which does not still survive in some one or other of the English
37050,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"provincial dialects. There is, perhaps, a single exception in the verb"
37051,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,to _sleeve_. To _sleeve_ silk means to divide or ravel out a thread of
37052,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"silk with the point of a needle till it becomes _floss_. (A.S. _sléfan_,"
37053,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to _cleave_=divide.) This, I think, explains the '_sleeveless_ errand'"
37054,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in 'Troilus and Cressida' so inadequately, sometimes so ludicrously"
37055,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,darkened by the commentators. Is not a 'sleeveless errand' one that
37056,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"cannot be unravelled, incomprehensible, and therefore bootless?"
37057,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37058,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"I am not speaking now of Americanisms properly so called, that is, of"
37059,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,words or phrases which have grown into use here either through
37060,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"necessity, invention, or accident, such as a _carry_, a _one-horse"
37061,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"affair_, a _prairie_, to _vamose_. Even these are fewer than is"
37062,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,sometimes taken for granted. But I think some fair defence may be made
37063,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"against the charge of vulgarity. Properly speaking, vulgarity is in the"
37064,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"thought, and not in the word or the way of pronouncing it. Modern"
37065,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"French, the most polite of languages, is barbarously vulgar if compared"
37066,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"with the Latin out of which it has been corrupted, or even with Italian."
37067,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"There is a wider gap, and one implying greater boorishness, between"

37071,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"than the diminutive cover_let_, into which it has been ignorantly"
37072,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,corrupted in politer speech. I obtained from three cultivated Englishmen
37073,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,at different times three diverse pronunciations of a single
37074,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"word,--_cowcumber_, _coocumber_, and _cucumber_. Of these the first,"
37075,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"which is Yankee also, comes nearest to the nasality of _concombre_. Lord"
37076,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Ossory assures us that Voltaire saw the best society in England, and"
37077,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Voltaire tells his countrymen that _handkerchief_ was pronounced
37078,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_hankercher_. I find it so spelt in Hakluyt and elsewhere. This enormity

37080,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"deviations from the sound as represented by the spelling, may we not"

37085,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"books, where I have noted them from time to time, a few examples of"
37086,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,pronunciation and phrase which will show that the Yankee often has
37087,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,antiquity and very respectable literary authority on his side. My list

37090,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37091,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,I will take first those cases in which something like the French sound
37092,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,has been preserved in certain single letters and diphthongs. And this
37093,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,opens a curious question as to how long this Gallicism maintained itself
37094,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,in England. Sometimes a divergence in pronunciation has given as two

37096,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"find coming in toward the close of the seventeenth century, and wavering"

37099,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"centuries ago, and carried out by him so far as his printers would"
37100,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"allow. This and the corresponding changes in _musique_, _musick_, and"
37101,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the like, which he also advocated, show that in his time the French"
37102,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,accent indicated by the superfluous letters (for French had once nearly
37103,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,as strong an accent as Italian) had gone out of use. There is plenty of
37104,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,French accent down to the end of Elizabeth's reign. In Daniel we have
37105,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_riches'_ and _counsel'_, in Bishop Hall _comet'_, _chapëlain_, in Donne"
37106,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_pictures'_, _virtue'_, _presence'_, _mortal'_, _merit'_, _hainous'_,"
37107,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_giant'_, with many more, and Marston's satires are full of them. The"
37108,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"two latter, however, are not to be relied on, as they may be suspected"
37109,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,of Chaucerizing. Herrick writes _baptime_. The tendency to throw the
37110,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"accent backward began early. But the incongruities are perplexing, and"
37111,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,perhaps mark the period of transition. In Warner's 'Albion's England' we
37112,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,have _creator'_ and _crëature'_ side by side with the modern _creator_
37113,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and _creature_. _E'nvy_ and _e'nvying_ occur in Campion (1602), and yet"
37114,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_envy'_ survived Milton. In some cases we have gone back again nearer to
37115,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the French, as in _rev'enue_ for _reven'ue_, I had been so used to"
37116,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"hearing _imbecile_ pronounced with the accent on the first syllable,"
37117,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"which is in accordance with the general tendency in such matters, that I"
37118,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,was surprised to find _imbec'ile_ in a verse of Wordsworth. The
37119,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"dictionaries all give it so. I asked a highly cultivated Englishman, and"
37120,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,he declared for _imbeceel'_. In general it may be assumed that accent
37121,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,will finally settle on the syllable dictated by greater ease and
37122,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"therefore quickness of utterance. _Blas'-phemous_, for example, is more"
37123,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"rapidly pronounced than _blasphem'ous_, to which our Yankee clings,"
37124,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,following in this the usage of many of the older poets. _Amer'ican_ is
37125,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"easier than _Ameri'can_, and therefore the false quantity has carried"
37126,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the day, though the true one may be found in George Herbert, and even so"
37127,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,late as Cowley.
37128,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37129,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,To come back to the matter in hand. Our 'uplandish man' retains the soft
37130,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"or thin sound of the _u_ in some words, such as _rule_, _truth_"
37131,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"(sometimes also pronounced _trŭth_, not _trooth_), while he says"
37132,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_noo_ for _new_, and gives to _view_ and _few_ so indescribable a"
37133,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,mixture of the two sounds with a slight nasal tincture that it may be
37134,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,called the Yankee shibboleth. Voltaire says that the English pronounce
37135,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_true_ as if it rhymed with _view_, and this is the sound our rustics"
37136,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,give to it. Spenser writes _deow_ (_dew_) which can only be pronounced
37137,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,with the Yankee nasality. In _rule_ the least sound of _a_ precedes the
37138,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_u_. I find _reule_ in Pecock's 'Repressor.' He probably pronounced it
37139,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_rayoolë_, as the old French word from which it is derived was very"
37140,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"likely to be sounded at first, with a reminiscence of its original"
37141,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_regula_. Tindal has _reuler_, and the Coventry Plays have _preudent_."
37142,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"In the 'Parlyament of Byrdes' I find _reule_. As for _noo_, may it not"
37143,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"claim some sanction in its derivation, whether from _nouveau_ or _neuf_,"
37144,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the ancient sound of which may very well have been _noof_, as nearer"
37145,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_novus_? _Beef_ would seem more like to have come from _buffe_ than from
37146,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_boeuf_, unless the two were mere varieties of spelling. The Saxon _few_"
37147,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,may have caught enough from its French cousin _peu_ to claim the benefit
37148,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,of the same doubt as to sound; and our slang phrase _a few_ (as 'I
37149,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,licked him a few') may well appeal to _un peu_ for sense and authority.

37151,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"an English disguise, it the latter should claim descent as, perhaps, he"
37152,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"fairly might, from the Latin _lambere_? The New England _ferce_ for"
37153,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_fierce_, and _perce_ for _pierce_ (sometimes heard as _fairce_ and"
37154,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_pairce_), are also Norman. For its antiquity I cite the rhyme of _verse"
37155,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and pierce_ in Chapman and Donne, and in some commendatory verses by a"
37156,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Mr. Berkenhead before the poems of Francis Beaumont. Our _pairlous_ for
37157,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_perilous_ is of the same kind, and is nearer Shakespeare's _parlous_"
37158,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,than the modern pronunciation. One other Gallicism survives in our
37159,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"pronunciation. Perhaps I should rather call it a semi-Gallicism, for it"
37160,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,is the result of a futile effort to reproduce a French sound with
37161,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"English lips. Thus for _joint_, _employ_, _royal_, we have _jynt_,"
37162,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_emply_, _r[)y]le_, the last differing only from _rile_ (_roil_) in a"
37163,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,prolongation of the _y_ sound. I find _royal_ so pronounced in the
37164,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,'Mirror for Magistrates.' In Walter de Biblesworth I find _solives_
37165,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Englished by _gistes_. This, it is true, may have been pronounced"
37166,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_jeests_, but the pronunciation _jystes_ must have preceded the present"
37167,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"spelling, which was no doubt adopted after the radical meaning was"
37168,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"forgotten, as analogical with other words in _oi_. In the same way after"
37169,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Norman-French influence had softened the _l_ out of _would_ (we already
37170,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"find _woud_ for _veut_ in N.F. poems), _should_ followed the example,"
37171,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and then an _l_ was foisted into _could_, where it does not belong, to"
37172,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"satisfy the logic of the eye, which has affected the pronunciation and"
37173,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,even the spelling of English more than is commonly supposed. I meet with
37174,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_eyster_ for _oyster_ as early as the fourteenth century. I find _viage_
37175,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in Bishop Hall and Middleton the dramatist, _bile_ for _boil_ in Donne"
37176,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and Chrononhotonthologos, _line_ for _loin_ in Hall, _ryall_ and _chyse_"
37177,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"(for choice) _dystrye_ for _destroy_, in the Coventry Plays. In"
37178,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Chapman's 'All Fools' is the misprint of _employ_ for _imply_, fairly"
37179,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"inferring an identity of sound in the last syllable. Indeed, this"
37180,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"pronunciation was habitual till after Pope, and Rogers tells us that the"
37181,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,elegant Gray said _naise_ for _noise_ just as our rustics still do. Our
37182,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_cornish_ (which I find also in Herrick) remembers the French better
37183,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,than _cornice_ does. While clinging more closely to the Anglo-Saxon in
37184,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"dropping the _g_ from the end of the present participle, the Yankee now"
37185,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and then pleases himself with an experiment in French nasality in words

37195,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37196,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Of Yankee preterites I find _risse_ and _rize_ for _rose_ in Beaumont

37203,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"find it in no writer of authority (except Golding), unless Chaucer's"
37204,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_seie_ and Gower's _sigh_ were, as I am inclined to think, so sounded."
37205,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_Shew_ is used by Hector Boece, Giles Fletcher, Drummond of Hawthornden,"
37206,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and in the Paston Letters. Similar strong preterites, like _snew_,"
37207,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_thew_, and even _mew_, are not without example. I find _sew_ for"
37208,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_sewed_ in 'Piers Ploughman.' Indeed, the anomalies in English"
37209,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,preterites are perplexing. We have probably transferred _flew_ from
37210,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_flow_ (as the preterite of which I have heard it) to _fly_ because we
37211,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,had another preterite in _fled_. Of weak preterites the Yankee retains
37212,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_growed_, _blowed_, for which he has good authority, and less often"
37213,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_knowed_. His _sot_ is merely a broad sounding of _sat_, no more"
37214,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"inelegant than the common _got_ for _gat_, which he further degrades"
37215,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"into _gut_. When he says _darst_, he uses a form as old as Chaucer."
37216,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37217,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,The Yankee has retained something of the long sound of the _a_ in such
37218,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"words as _axe_, _wax_, pronouncing them _exe_, _wex_ (shortened from"
37219,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_aix_, _waix_). He also says _hev_ and _hed_ (_hāve_, _hād_ for"
37220,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_have_ and _had_). In most cases he follows an Anglo-Saxon usage. In
37221,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_aix_ for _axle_ he certainly does. I find _wex_ and _aisches_ (_ashes_)
37222,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in Pecock, and _exe_ in the Paston Letters. Golding rhymes _wax_ with"
37223,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_wexe_ and spells _challenge_ _chelenge_. Chaucer wrote _hendy_. Dryden
37224,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"rhymes _can_ with _men_, as Mr. Biglow would. Alexander Gill, Milton's"
37225,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"teacher, in his 'Logonomia' cites _hez_ for _hath_ as peculiar to"
37226,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Lincolnshire. I find _hayth_ in Collier's 'Bibliographical Account of

37228,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,wrote it. Sir Christopher Wren wrote _belcony_. Our _fect_ is only the
37229,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,O.F. _faict_. _Thaim_ for _them_ was common in the sixteenth century. We
37230,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,have an example of the same thing in the double form of the verb
37231,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_thrash_, _thresh_. While the New Englander cannot be brought to say"

37245,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_blowth_ means the blossoming in general. A farmer would say that there

37247,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and away from the railways, year by year. Wither rhymes _hinder_ with"

37276,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37277,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,I shall now give some examples which cannot so easily be ranked under
37278,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,any special head. Gill charges the Eastern counties with _kiver_ for
37279,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_cover_, and _ta_, for _to_. The Yankee pronounces both _too_ and _to_"
37280,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,like _ta_ (like the _tou_ in _touch_) where they are not emphatic. When
37281,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"they are, both become _tu_. In old spelling, _to_ is the common (and"
37282,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"indeed correct) form of _too_, which is only _to_ with the sense of _in"
37283,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,addition_. I suspect that the sound of our _too_ has caught something
37284,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"from the French _tout_, and it is possible that the old _too too_ is not"
37285,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"a reduplication, but a reminiscence of the feminine form of the same"

37287,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Gill gives a Northern origin to _geaun_ for _gown_ and _waund_ for
37288,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_wound_ (_vulnus_). Lovelace has _waund_, but"
37289,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,there is something too dreadful in suspecting Spenser (who _borealised_

37525,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,I will now leave pronunciation and turn to words or phrases which have

37529,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,word of which I have never met with any example in any English writer of

37532,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the German _welken_, but I have never come upon it in literary use, and"
37533,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"my own books of reference give me faint help. Graff gives _welhèn_,"

37768,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"prominent is the beginning sentences, especially in answer to questions,"
37769,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,with 'well.' Put before such a phrase as 'How d'e do?' it is commonly

37785,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,showing that a conclusion had been reached. I have used this latter form
37786,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in the 'Biglow Papers,' because, if enough nasality be added, it"

37800,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and affirmed their own to be the result of a certain diet. In another
37801,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,passage of the same narrative the word has its more common meaning of
37802,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"approving or praising: 'The said king, much allowing this declaration,"
37803,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,said.' Ducange quotes Bracton _sub voce_ ADLOCARE for the meaning 'to
37804,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"admit as proved,' and the transition from this to 'affirm,' is by no"
37805,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,means violent. Izaak Walton has 'Lebault _allows_ waterfrogs to be good
37806,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"meat,' and here the word is equivalent to _affirms_. At the same time,"
37807,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"when we consider some of the meanings of _allow_ in old English, and of"
37808,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_allouer_ in old French, and also remember that the verbs _prize_ and"
37809,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_praise_ are from one root, I think we must admit _allaudare_ to a share"
37810,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,in the paternity of _allow_. The sentence from Hakluyt would read
37811,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"equally well, 'contemning our strengthe, ... and praising (or valuing)"
37812,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,their great eating of flesh as the cause of their increase in strength.'

37825,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"except in Dr. Mather's 'Bemarkable Providences,' which he oddly calls a"
37826,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'very old book.' Franklin, as Dr. Pickering goes on to show, was"
37827,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,mistaken.
37828,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37829,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Mr. Bartlett in his 'Dictionary' merely abridges Pickering. Both of them
37830,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"should have confined the application of the word to material things, its"
37831,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,extension to which is all that is peculiar in the supposed American use
37832,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,of it. For surely 'Complete Letter-Writers' have been '_improving_ this
37833,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,opportunity' time out of mind. I will illustrate the word a little
37834,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"further, because Pickering cites no English authorities. Skelton has a"
37835,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"passage in his 'Phyllyp Sparowe,' which I quote the rather as it"
37836,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,contains also the word _allowed_ and as it distinguishes _improve_ from
37837,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_employ:_--
37838,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37839,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'His [Chaucer's] Englysh well alowed,"
37840,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,So as it is _emprowed_
37841,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"For as it is employd,"
37842,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,There is no English voyd.'
37843,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37844,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Here the meaning is to _profit by_. In Fuller's 'Holy Warre' (1647), we"
37845,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"have 'The Egyptians standing on the firm ground, were thereby enabled to"
37846,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,_improve_ and enforce their darts to the utmost.' Here the word might
37847,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,certainly mean _to make use of_. Mrs. Hutchison (Life of Colonel H.)
37848,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,uses the word in the same way: 'And therefore did not _emproove_ his
37849,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,interest to engage the country in the quarrel.' Swift in one of his
37850,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,letters says: 'There is not an acre of land in Ireland turned to half

37853,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'Morals'(1714), but I know of only one example of its use in the purely"

37859,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,In running over the fly-leaves of those delightful folios for this
37860,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"reference, I find a note which reminds me of another word, for our abuse"
37861,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of which we have been deservedly ridiculed. I mean _lady,_ It is true I"
37862,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"might cite the example of the Italian _donna_[30] (_domina_), which has"
37863,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"been treated in the same way by a whole nation, and not, as _lady_ among"
37864,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"us, by the uncultivated only. It perhaps grew into use in the"
37865,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,half-democratic republics of Italy in the same way and for the same
37866,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,reasons as with us. But I admit that our abuse of the word is
37867,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,villainous. I know of an orator who once said in a public meeting where
37868,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"bonnets preponderated, that 'the ladies were last at the cross and first"
37869,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,at the tomb'! But similar sins were committed before our day and in the
37870,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,mother country. In the 'Harleian Miscellany' (vol. v. p. 455) I find
37871,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,'this _lady_ is my servant; the hedger's daughter Ioan.' in the 'State

37873,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and I hear the Lord High Steward speaking of the wife of a waiter at a

37875,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,state that our vile habit of chewing tobacco had the somewhat unsavory

37979,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
37980,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,It is always worth while to note down the erratic words or phrases which
37981,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,one meets with in any dialect. They may throw light on the meaning of
37982,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"other words, on the relationship of languages, or even on history"
37983,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,itself. In so composite a language as ours they often supply a different
37984,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"form to express a different shade of meaning, as in _viol_ and _fiddle_,"
37985,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_thrid_ and _thread_, _smother_ and _smoulder_, where the _l_ has crept"
37986,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,in by a false analogy with _would_. We have given back to England the
37987,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"excellent adjective _lengthy_, formed honestly like _earthy, drouthy_,"
37988,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and others, thus enabling their journalists to characterize our"
37989,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,President's messages by a word civilly compromising between _long_ and
37990,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_tedious_, so as not to endanger the peace of the two countries by"
37991,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,wounding our national sensitiveness to British criticism. Let me give
37992,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,two curious examples of the antiseptic property of dialects at which I
37993,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,have already glanced. Dante has _dindi_ as a childish or low word for
37994,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_danari_ (money), and in Shropshire small Roman coins are still dug up"
37995,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,which the peasants call _dinders_. This can hardly be a chance
37996,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"coincidence, but seems rather to carry the word back to the Roman"
37997,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"soldiery. So our farmers say _chuk, chuk_, to their pigs, and _ciacco_"
37998,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,is one of the Italian words for _hog_. When a countryman tells us that
37999,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"he 'fell _all of a heap_,' I cannot help thinking that he unconsciously"
38000,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"points to an affinity between our word _tumble_, and the Latin"
38001,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_tumulus_, that is older than most others. I believe that words, or even"
38002,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the mere intonation of them, have an astonishing vitality and power of"
38003,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"propagation by the root, like the gardener's pest, quitch-grass,[31]"
38004,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,while the application or combination of them may be new. It is in these
38005,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"last that my countrymen seem to me full of humor, invention, quickness"
38006,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of wit, and that sense of subtle analogy which needs only refining to"
38007,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,become fancy and imagination. Prosaic as American life seems in many of
38008,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"its aspects to a European, bleak and bare as it is on the side of"
38009,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"tradition, and utterly orphaned of the solemn inspiration of antiquity,"
38010,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,I cannot help thinking that the ordinary talk of unlettered men among us
38011,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,is fuller of metaphor and of phrases that suggest lively images than
38012,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,that of any other people I have seen. Very many such will be found in
38013,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Mr. Bartlett's book, though his short list of proverbs at the end seem"
38014,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to me, with one or two exceptions, as un-American as possible. Most of"
38015,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"them have no character at all but coarseness, and are quite too"
38016,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"long-skirted for working proverbs, in which language always 'takes off"
38017,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"its coat to it,' as a Yankee would say. There are plenty that have a"
38018,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"more native and puckery flavor, seedlings from the old stock often, and"
38019,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"yet new varieties. One hears such not seldom among us Easterners, and"
38020,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the West would yield many more. 'Mean enough to steal acorns from a
38021,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,blind hog;' 'Cold as the north side of a Jenooary gravestone by
38022,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,starlight;' 'Hungry as a graven image;' 'Pop'lar as a hen with one

38024,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,'Ther's sech a thing ez bein' _tu_' (our Yankee paraphrase of [Greek:
38025,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"maeden agan]); hence the phrase _tooin' round_, meaning a supererogatory"
38026,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,activity like that of flies; 'Stingy enough to skim his milk at both
38027,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,eends;' 'Hot as the Devil's kitchen;' 'Handy as a pocket in a shirt;'
38028,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'He's a whole team and the dog under the wagon;' 'All deacons are good,"
38029,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,but there's odds in deacons' (to _deacon_ berries is to put the largest
38030,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,atop); 'So thievish they hev to take in their stone walls nights;'[32]
38031,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"may serve as specimens. 'I take my tea _barfoot_,' said a backwoodsman"
38032,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"when asked if he would have cream and sugar. (I find _barfoot_, by the"
38033,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"way, in the Coventry Plays.) A man speaking to me once of a very rocky"
38034,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"clearing said, 'Stone's got a pretty heavy mortgage on that land,' and I"
38035,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,overheard a guide in the woods say to his companions who were urging him
38036,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to sing, 'Wal, I _did_ sing once, but toons gut invented, an' thet spilt"
38037,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,my trade.' Whoever has driven over a stream by a bridge made of _slabs_
38038,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,will feel the picturesque force of the epithet _slab-bridged_ applied to
38039,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,a fellow of shaky character. Almost every county has some good
38040,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"die-sinker in phrase, whose mintage passes into the currency of the"
38041,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,whole neighborhood. Such a one described the county jail (the one stone
38042,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,building where all the dwellings are of wood) as 'the house whose
38043,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"underpinnin' come up to the eaves,' and called hell 'the place where"
38044,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,they didn't rake up their fires nights.' I once asked a stage-driver if
38045,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the other side of a hill were as steep as the one we were climbing:
38046,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,'Steep? chain lightnin' couldn' go down it 'thout puttin' the shoe on!'
38047,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,And this brings me back to the exaggeration of which I spoke before. To
38048,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,me there is something very taking in the negro 'so black that charcoal
38049,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"made a chalk-mark on him,' and the wooden shingle 'painted so like"
38050,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"marble that it sank in water,' as if its very consciousness or its"
38051,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,vanity had been overpersuaded by the cunning of the painter. I heard a
38052,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"man, in order to give a notion of some very cold weather, say to another"
38053,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"that a certain Joe, who had been taking mercury, found a lump of"
38054,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"quicksilver in each boot, when he went home to dinner. This power of"
38055,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,rapidly dramatizing a dry fact into flesh and blood and the vivid
38056,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,conception of Joe as a human thermometer strike me as showing a poetic
38057,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"sense that may be refined into faculty. At any rate there is humor here,"
38058,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and not mere quickness of wit,--the deeper and not the shallower"
38059,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,quality. The _tendency_ of humor is always towards overplus of
38060,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"expression, while the very essence of wit is its logical precision."
38061,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Captain Basil Hall denied that our people had any humor, deceived,"
38062,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"perhaps, by their gravity of manner. But this very seriousness is often"
38063,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the outward sign of that humorous quality of the mind which delights in
38064,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"finding an element of identity in things seemingly the most incongruous,"
38065,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and then again in forcing an incongruity upon things identical. Perhaps
38066,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Captain Hall had no humor himself, and if so he would never find it. Did"
38067,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"he always feel the point of what was said to himself? I doubt it,"
38068,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,because I happen to know a chance he once had given him in vain. The
38069,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Captain was walking up and down the veranda of a country tavern in
38070,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Massachusetts while the coach changed horses. A thunder-storm was going
38071,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"on, and, with that pleasant European air of indirect self-compliment in"
38072,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"condescending to be surprised by American merit, which we find so"
38073,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"conciliating, he said to a countryman lounging against the door, 'Pretty"
38074,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"heavy thunder you have here.' The other, who had divined at a glance his"
38075,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"feeling of generous concession to a new country, drawled gravely, 'Waal,"
38076,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"we _du_, considerin' the number of inhabitants.' This, the more I"
38077,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"analyze it, the more humorous does it seem. The same man was capable of"
38078,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"wit also, when he would. He was a cabinet-maker, and was once employed"
38079,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,to make some commandment-tables for the parish meeting-house. The
38080,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"parson, a very old man, annoyed him by looking into his workshop every"
38081,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"morning, and cautioning him to be very sure to pick out 'clear mahogany"
38082,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"without any _knots_ in it.' At last, wearied out, he retorted one day:"
38083,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'Wal, Dr. B., I guess ef I was to leave the _nots_ out o' some o' the"
38084,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"c'man'ments, 't'ould soot you full ez wal!'"
38085,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38086,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,If I had taken the pains to write down the proverbial or pithy phrases I
38087,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"have heard, or if I had sooner thought of noting the Yankeeisms I met"
38088,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"with in my reading, I might have been able to do more justice to my"
38089,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"theme. But I have done all I wished in respect to pronunciation, if I"
38090,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"have proved that where we are vulgar, we have the countenance of very"
38091,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"good company. For, as to the _jus et norma loquendi_, I agree with"
38092,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Horace and those who have paraphrased or commented him, from Boileau to"
38093,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Gray. I think that a good rule for style is Galiani's definition of
38094,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"sublime oratory,--'l'art de tout dire sans être mis à la Bastille dans"
38095,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,un pays où il est defendu de rien dire.' I profess myself a fanatical

38105,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'Tis possible to climb,"
38106,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"To kindle, or to slake,"

38108,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38109,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Cumberland in his Memoirs tells us that when, in the midst of Admiral"

38117,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,pseudo-classicality when I chose our homely dialect to work in. Should
38118,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"we be nothing, because somebody had contrived to be something (and that"
38119,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,perhaps in a provincial dialect) ages ago? and to be nothing by our very
38120,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"attempt to be that something, which they had already been, and which"
38121,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,therefore nobody could be again without being a bore? Is there no way
38122,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"left, then, I thought, of being natural, of being _naïf_, which means"
38123,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"nothing more than native, of belonging to the age and country in which"
38124,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"you are born? The Yankee, at least, is a new phenomenon; let us try to"

38126,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"written up everywhere else? In the literary world, things seemed to me"
38127,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"very much as they were in the latter half of the last century. Pope,"
38128,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,skimming the cream of good sense and expression wherever he could find

38130,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,worldly wisdom which pleasantly lubricated some of the drier morsels of

38132,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,went on for the next fifty years coaxing his buttermilk with the regular

38141,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Beside the advantage of getting out of the beaten track, our dialect"
38142,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,offered others hardly inferior. As I was about to make an endeavor to
38143,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"state them, I remembered something that the clear-sighted Goethe had"
38144,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"said about Hebel's 'Allemannische Gedichte,' which, making proper"

38146,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,I would have said far better than I could hope to do: 'Allen diesen

38154,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,do not mean to imply that _I_ have come near achieving any such success
38155,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"as the great critic here indicates, but I think the success is _there_,"
38156,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and to be plucked by some more fortunate hand.
38157,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38158,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Nevertheless, I was encouraged by the approval of many whose opinions I"

38161,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"any one of those I have known (no longer living), except Hawthorne,"
38162,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,impressed me with the constant presence of that indefinable thing we
38163,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,call genius. He often suggested that I should try my hand at some Yankee
38164,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Pastorals, which would admit of more sentiment and a higher tone without"

38167,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,his counsel and the deeper feeling called up by the great interests at

38169,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,than could have been admitted without incongruity into the former
38170,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"series. The time seemed calling to me, with the old poet,--"
38171,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38172,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'Leave, then, your wonted prattle,"

38176,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38177,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,The only attempt I had ever made at anything like a pastoral (if that
38178,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident)
38179,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,was in 'The Courtin'.' While the introduction to the First Series was
38180,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"going through the press, I received word from the printer that there was"
38181,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,a blank page left which must be filled. I sat down at once and
38182,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"improvised another fictitious 'notice of the press,' in which, because"
38183,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose, I inserted an extract"
38184,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"from a supposed ballad of Mr. Biglow. I kept no copy of it, and the"
38185,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"printer, as directed, cut it off when the gap was filled. Presently I"
38186,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"began to receive letters asking for the rest of it, sometimes for the"
38187,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_balance_ of it. I had none, but to answer such demands, I patched a"
38188,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,conclusion upon it in a later edition. Those who had only the first
38189,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"continued to importune me. Afterward, being asked to write it out as an"
38190,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"autograph for the Baltimore Sanitary Commission Fair, I added other"
38191,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"verses, into some of which I fused a little more sentiment in a homely"
38192,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"way, and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters'"
38193,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and making a connected story. Most likely I have spoiled it, but I shall"
38194,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"put it at the end of this Introduction, to answer once for all those"
38195,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,kindly importunings.
38196,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38197,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,As I have seen extracts from what purported to be writings of Mr.
38198,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Biglow, which were not genuine, I may properly take this opportunity to"
38199,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"say, that the two volumes now published contain every line I ever"
38200,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"printed under that pseudonyme, and that I have never, so far as I can"

38203,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"except a review of Mrs. Stowe's 'Minister's Wooing,' and, some twenty"

38205,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,English journal.
38206,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38207,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,A word more on pronunciation. I have endeavored to express this so far
38208,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"as I could by the types, taking such pains as, I fear, may sometimes"
38209,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"make the reading harder than need be. At the same time, by studying"
38210,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,uniformity I have sometimes been obliged to sacrifice minute exactness.
38211,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"The emphasis often modifies the habitual sound. For example, _for_ is"
38212,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"commonly _fer_ (a shorter sound than _fur_ for _far_), but when emphatic"
38213,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"it always becomes _for_, as 'wut _for!_' So _too_ is pronounced like"
38214,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_to_ (as it was anciently spelt), and _to_ like _ta_ (the sound as in"
38215,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the _tou_ of _touch_), but _too_, when emphatic, changes into _tue_, and"
38216,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_to_, sometimes, in similar cases, into _toe_, as 'I didn' hardly know"
38217,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"wut _toe_ du!' Where vowels come together, or one precedes another"
38218,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"following an aspirate, the two melt together, as was common with the"
38219,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,older poets who formed their versification on French or Italian models.
38220,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Drayton is thoroughly Yankee when he says 'I 'xpect,' and Pope when he"
38221,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"says, 't' inspire.' _With_ becomes sometimes _'ith_, _'ŭth_, or"
38222,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_'th_, or even disappears wholly where it comes before _the_, as, 'I"
38223,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"went along _th'_ Square' (along with the Squire), the _are_ sound being"
38224,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"an archaism which I have noticed also in _choir_, like the old Scottish"

38228,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,strong accent on the last syllable. This oddity has some support in the
38229,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"erratic _towards'_ instead of _to'wards_, which we find in the poets and"
38230,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"sometimes hear. The sound given to the first syllable of _to'wards_, I"
38231,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"may remark, sustains the Yankee lengthening of the _o_ in _to_. At the"
38232,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"beginning of a sentence, _ahterwurds_ has the accent on the first"
38233,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"syllable; at the end of one, on the last; as, '_ah'terwurds_ he tol'"
38234,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"me,' 'he tol' me _ahterwurds'_.' The Yankee never makes a mistake in his"
38235,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"aspirates. _U_ changes in many words to _e_, always in _such, brush,"
38236,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"tush, hush, rush, blush_, seldom in _much_, oftener in _trust_ and"
38237,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_crust_, never in _mush, gust, bust, tumble_, or (?) _flush_, in the"
38238,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,latter case probably to avoid confusion with _flesh_. I have heard
38239,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_flush_ with the _e_ sound, however. For the same reason, I suspect,"
38240,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"never in _gush_ (at least, I never heard it), because we have already"
38241,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,one _gesh_ for _gash_. _A_ and _i_ short frequently become _e_ short.

38244,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"beginning with _om_. _T_ and _d_, _b_ and _p_, _v_ and _w_, remain"
38245,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,intact. So much occurs to me in addition to what I said on this head in
38246,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the preface to the former volume.
38247,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38248,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Of course in what I have said I wish to be understood as keeping in mind
38249,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the difference between provincialisms properly so called and _slang_.
38250,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_Slang_ is always vulgar, because it is not a natural but an affected"
38251,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"way of talking, and all mere tricks of speech or writing are offensive."
38252,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"I do not think that Mr. Biglow can be fairly charged with vulgarity, and"
38253,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"I should have entirely failed in my design, if I had not made it appear"
38254,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,that high and even refined sentiment may coexist with the shrewder and
38255,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,more comic elements of the Yankee character. I believe that what is
38256,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,essentially vulgar and mean-spirited in politics seldom has its source
38257,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"in the body of the people, but much rather among those who are made"
38258,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,timid by their wealth or selfish by their love of power. A democracy can
38259,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"_afford_ much better than an aristocracy to follow out its convictions,"
38260,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and is perhaps better qualified to build those convictions on plain
38261,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"principles of right and wrong, rather than on the shifting sands of"
38262,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,expediency. I had always thought 'Sam Slick' a libel on the Yankee
38263,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"character, and a complete falsification of Yankee modes of speech,"
38264,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"though, for aught I know, it may be true in both respects so far as the"
38265,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"British provinces are concerned. To me the dialect was native, was"
38266,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"spoken all about me when a boy, at a time when an Irish day-laborer was"
38267,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,as rare as an American one now. Since then I have made a study of it so
38268,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"far as opportunity allowed. But when I write in it, it is as in a mother"
38269,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"tongue, and I am carried back far beyond any studies of it to long-ago"
38270,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"noonings in my father's hay-fields, and to the talk of Sam and Job over"
38271,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,their jug of _blackstrap_ under the shadow of the ash-tree which still
38272,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,dapples the grass whence they have been gone so long.

38275,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"whom this introductory epistle is addressed, farewell. Though some of"
38276,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"you have remonstrated with me, I shall never write any more 'Biglow"

38279,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,bringing out Mr. Sawin as an 'original Union man.' The very favor with
38280,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"which they have been received is a hindrance to me, by forcing on me a"
38281,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,self-consciousness from which I was entirely free when I wrote the First
38282,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Series. Moreover, I am no longer the same careless youth, with nothing"
38283,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"to do but live to myself, my books, and my friends, that I was then. I"
38284,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"always hated politics, in the ordinary sense of the word, and I am not"
38285,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"likely to grow, fonder of them, now that I have learned how rare it is"
38286,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,to find a man who can keep principle clear from party and personal
38287,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"prejudice, or can conceive the possibility of another's doing so. I feel"
38288,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"as if I could in some sort claim to be an _emeritus_, and I am sure that"
38289,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,political satire will have full justice done it by that genuine and
38290,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"delightful humorist, the Rev. Petroleum V. Nasby. I regret that I killed"
38291,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"off Mr. Wilbur so soon, for he would have enabled me to bring into this"
38292,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"preface a number of learned quotations, which must now go a-begging, and"
38293,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,also enabled me to dispersonalize myself into a vicarious egotism. He
38294,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,would have helped me likewise in clearing myself from a charge which I
38295,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"shall briefly touch on, because my friend Mr. Hughes has found it"
38296,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,needful to defend me in his preface to one of the English editions of
38297,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,the 'Biglow Papers.' I thank Mr. Hughes heartily for his friendly care
38298,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"of my good name, and were his Preface accessible to my readers here (as"
38299,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"I am glad it is not, for its partiality makes me blush), I should leave"
38300,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"the matter where he left it. The charge is of profanity, brought in by"
38301,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"persons who proclaimed African slavery of Divine institution, and is"
38302,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,based (so far as I have heard) on two passages in the First Series--
38303,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38304,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"'An' you've gut to git up airly,"
38305,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Ef you want to take in God,'"
38306,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38307,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"and,"
38308,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,

38310,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38311,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,and on some Scriptural illustrations by Mr. Sawin.
38312,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,
38313,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"Now, in the first place, I was writing under an assumed character, and"
38314,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,must talk as the person would whose mouthpiece I made myself. Will any
38315,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,one familiar with the New England countryman venture to tell me that he
38316,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,does _not_ speak of sacred things familiarly? that Biblical allusions
38317,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"(allusions, that is, to the single book with whose language, from his"
38318,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"church-going habits, he is intimate) are _not_ frequent on his lips? If"
38319,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"so, he cannot have pursued his studies of the character on so many"
38320,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,long-ago muster-fields and at so many cattle-shows as I. But I scorn any
38321,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"such line of defence, and will confess at once that one of the things I"
38322,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,am proud of in my countrymen is (I am not speaking now of such persons
38323,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,as I have assumed Mr. Sawin to be) that they do not put their Maker away
38324,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"far from them, or interpret the fear of God into being afraid of Him."
38325,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"The Talmudists had conceived a deep truth when they said, that 'all"
38326,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"things were in the power of God, save the fear of God;' and when people"
38327,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"stand in great dread of an invisible power, I suspect they mistake quite"
38328,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,another personage for the Deity. I might justify myself for the passages
38329,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,"criticised by many parallel ones from Scripture, but I need not. The"
38330,I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS,Reverend Homer Wilbur's note-books supply me with three apposite
