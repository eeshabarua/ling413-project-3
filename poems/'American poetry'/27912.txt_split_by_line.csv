143,GLOUCESTER MOORS,A mile behind is Gloucester town
144,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Where the fishing fleets put in,"
145,GLOUCESTER MOORS,A mile ahead the land dips down
146,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And the woods and farms begin.
147,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Here, where the moors stretch free"
148,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"In the high blue afternoon,"
149,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Are the marching sun and talking sea,"
150,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And the racing winds that wheel and flee
151,GLOUCESTER MOORS,On the flying heels of June.
152,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
153,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,"
154,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Blue is the quaker-maid,"
155,GLOUCESTER MOORS,The wild geranium holds its dew
156,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Long in the boulder's shade.
157,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Wax-red hangs the cup
158,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"From the huckleberry boughs,"
159,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"In barberry bells the grey moths sup,"
160,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up
161,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Sweet bowls for their carouse.
162,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
163,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Over the shelf of the sandy cove
164,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Beach-peas blossom late.
165,GLOUCESTER MOORS,By copse and cliff the swallows rove
166,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Each calling to his mate.
167,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Seaward the sea-gulls go,"
168,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And the land-birds all are here;
169,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"That green-gold flash was a vireo,"
170,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow
171,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Was a scarlet tanager.
172,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
173,GLOUCESTER MOORS,This earth is not the steadfast place
174,GLOUCESTER MOORS,We landsmen build upon;
175,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"From deep to deep she varies pace,"
176,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And while she comes is gone.
177,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Beneath my feet I feel
178,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Her smooth bulk heave and dip;
179,GLOUCESTER MOORS,With velvet plunge and soft upreel
180,GLOUCESTER MOORS,She swings and steadies to her keel
181,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Like a gallant, gallant ship."
182,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
183,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"These summer clouds she sets for sail,"
184,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"The sun is her masthead light,"
185,GLOUCESTER MOORS,She tows the moon like a pinnace frail
186,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Where her phosphor wake churns bright.
187,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Now hid, now looming clear,"
188,GLOUCESTER MOORS,On the face of the dangerous blue
189,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"The star fleets tack and wheel and veer,"
190,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"But on, but on does the old earth steer"
191,GLOUCESTER MOORS,As if her port she knew.
192,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
193,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"God, dear God! Does she know her port,"
194,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Though she goes so far about?
195,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Or blind astray, does she make her sport"
196,GLOUCESTER MOORS,To brazen and chance it out?
197,GLOUCESTER MOORS,I watched when her captains passed:
198,GLOUCESTER MOORS,She were better captainless.
199,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Men in the cabin, before the mast,"
200,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"But some were reckless and some aghast,"
201,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And some sat gorged at mess.
202,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
203,GLOUCESTER MOORS,By her battened hatch I leaned and caught
204,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Sounds from the noisome hold,--"
205,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Cursing and sighing of souls distraught
206,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And cries too sad to be told.
207,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Then I strove to go down and see;
208,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"But they said, ""Thou art not of us!"""
209,GLOUCESTER MOORS,I turned to those on the deck with me
210,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"And cried, ""Give help!"" But they said, ""Let be:"
211,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Our ship sails faster thus."""
212,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
213,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,"
214,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Blue is the quaker-maid,"
215,GLOUCESTER MOORS,The alder-clump where the brook comes through
216,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Breeds cresses in its shade.
217,GLOUCESTER MOORS,To be out of the moiling street
218,GLOUCESTER MOORS,With its swelter and its sin!
219,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Who has given to me this sweet,"
220,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And given my brother dust to eat?
221,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And when will his wage come in?
222,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
223,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Scattering wide or blown in ranks,"
224,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Yellow and white and brown,"
225,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Boats and boats from the fishing banks
226,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Come home to Gloucester town.
227,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"There is cash to purse and spend,"
228,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"There are wives to be embraced,"
229,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend,"
230,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"And hearts to take and keep to the end,--"
231,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"O little sails, make haste!"
232,GLOUCESTER MOORS,
233,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"But thou, vast outbound ship of souls,"
234,GLOUCESTER MOORS,What harbor town for thee?
235,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"What shapes, when thy arriving tolls,"
236,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Shall crowd the banks to see?
237,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Shall all the happy shipmates then
238,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Stand singing brotherly?
239,GLOUCESTER MOORS,Or shall a haggard ruthless few
240,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Warp her over and bring her to,"
241,GLOUCESTER MOORS,While the many broken souls of men
242,GLOUCESTER MOORS,"Fester down in the slaver's pen,"
243,GLOUCESTER MOORS,And nothing to say or do?

248,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT
249,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
250,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
251,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,At last the bird that sang so long
252,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"In twilight circles, hushed his song:"
253,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Above the ancient square
254,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,The stars came here and there.
255,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
256,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Good Friday night! Some hearts were bowed,"
257,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,But some amid the waiting crowd
258,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Because of too much youth
259,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Felt not that mystic ruth;
260,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
261,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,And of these hearts my heart was one:
262,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Nor when beneath the arch of stone
263,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,With dirge and candle flame
264,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"The cross of passion came,"
265,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
266,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Did my glad spirit feel reproof,"
267,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Though on the awful tree aloof,"
268,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Unspiritual, dead,"
269,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Drooped the ensanguined Head.
270,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
271,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,To one who stood where myrtles made
272,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,A little space of deeper shade
273,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"(As I could half descry,"
274,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"A stranger, even as I),"
275,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
276,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"I said, ""These youths who bear along"
277,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"The symbols of their Saviour's wrong,"
278,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"The spear, the garment torn,"
279,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"The flaggel, and the thorn,--"
280,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
281,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"""Why do they make this mummery?"
282,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Would not a brave man gladly die
283,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,For a much smaller thing
284,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Than to be Christ and king?"""
285,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
286,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"He answered nothing, and I turned."
287,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Throned in its hundred candles burned
288,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,The jeweled eidolon
289,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Of her who bore the Son.
290,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
291,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"The crowd was prostrate; still, I felt"
292,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,No shame until the stranger knelt;
293,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Then not to kneel, almost"
294,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Seemed like a vulgar boast.
295,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
296,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"I knelt. The doll-face, waxen white,"
297,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Flowered out a living dimness; bright
298,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Dawned the dear mortal grace
299,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Of my own mother's face.
300,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
301,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"When we were risen up, the street"
302,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Was vacant; all the air hung sweet
303,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,With lemon-flowers; and soon
304,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,The sky would hold the moon.
305,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
306,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,More silently than new-found friends
307,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,To whom much silence makes amends
308,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,For the much babble vain
309,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"While yet their lives were twain,"
310,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
311,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,We walked along the odorous hill.
312,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,The light was little yet; his will
313,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,I could not see to trace
314,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Upon his form or face.
315,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
316,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"So when aloft the gold moon broke,"
317,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"I cried, heart-stung. As one who woke"
318,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,He turned unto my cries
319,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,The anguish of his eyes.
320,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
321,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"""Friend! Master!"" I cried falteringly,"
322,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"""Thou seest the thing they make of thee."
323,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"Oh, by the light divine"
324,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"My mother shares with thine,"
325,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
326,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"""I beg that I may lay my head"
327,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,Upon thy shoulder and be fed
328,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"With thoughts of brotherhood!"""
329,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,"So through the odorous wood,"
330,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,
331,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,More silently than friends new-found
332,GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT,We walked. At the first meadow bound

395,I,"To the good memory of Robert Shaw,"
396,I,"This bright March morn I stand,"

398,I,Knowing that what I hear is not unheard
399,I,"Of this boy soldier and his negro band,"
400,I,"For all their gaze is fixed so stern ahead,"
401,I,For all the fatal rhythm of their tread.
402,I,The land they died to save from death and shame

411,II,No hint of green; but to my listening heart
412,II,The still earth doth impart
413,II,"Assurance of her jubilant emprise,"
414,II,And it is clear to my long-searching eyes
415,II,That love at last has might upon the skies.
416,II,The ice is runneled on the little pond;
417,II,A telltale patter drips from off the trees;
418,II,"The air is touched with southland spiceries,"
419,II,As if but yesterday it tossed the frond
420,II,Of pendent mosses where the live-oaks grow

454,III,That watch old sluggish glaciers downward creep
455,III,"To fling their icebergs thundering from the steep,"
456,III,And Mariposa through the purple calms
457,III,Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms
458,III,"Where East and West are met,--"
459,III,A rich seal on the ocean's bosom set
460,III,"To say that East and West are twain,"

471,IV,"Must I be humble, then,"
472,IV,Now when my heart hath need of pride?
473,IV,Wild love falls on me from these sculptured men;
474,IV,By loving much the land for which they died
475,IV,I would be justified.
476,IV,My spirit was away on pinions wide
477,IV,To soothe in praise of her its passionate mood
478,IV,And ease it of its ache of gratitude.
479,IV,Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay
480,IV,On me and the companions of my day.
481,IV,I would remember now
482,IV,"My country's goodliness, make sweet her name."
483,IV,Alas! what shade art thou

494,V,We have not sold our loftiest heritage.
495,V,The proud republic hath not stooped to cheat
496,V,And scramble in the market-place of war;
497,V,Her forehead weareth yet its solemn star.
498,V,"Here is her witness: this, her perfect son,"
499,V,This delicate and proud New England soul
500,V,"Who leads despisèd men, with just-unshackled feet,"
501,V,"Up the large ways where death and glory meet,"
502,V,"To show all peoples that our shame is done,"

509,VI,"All night he lay, speaking some simple word"
510,VI,"From hour to hour to the slow minds that heard,"
511,VI,Holding each poor life gently in his hand
512,VI,And breathing on the base rejected clay
513,VI,Till each dark face shone mystical and grand
514,VI,Against the breaking day;
515,VI,"And lo, the shard the potter cast away"
516,VI,Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine
517,VI,Fulfilled of the divine
518,VI,Great wine of battle wrath by God's ring-finger stirred.
519,VI,"Then upward, where the shadowy bastion loomed"
520,VI,"Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light,"
521,VI,"Whence now, and now, infernal flowerage bloomed,"
522,VI,"Bloomed, burst, and scattered down its deadly seed,--"
523,VI,"They swept, and died like freemen on the height,"
524,VI,"Like freemen, and like men of noble breed;"
525,VI,And when the battle fell away at night
526,VI,By hasty and contemptuous hands were thrust
527,VI,Obscurely in a common grave with him
528,VI,The fair-haired keeper of their love and trust.
529,VI,Now limb doth mingle with dissolvèd limb
530,VI,In nature's busy old democracy
531,VI,To flush the mountain laurel when she blows
532,VI,"Sweet by the southern sea,"
533,VI,And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the rose:--
534,VI,The untaught hearts with the high heart that knew
535,VI,This mountain fortress for no earthly hold
536,VI,"Of temporal quarrel, but the bastion old"
537,VI,"Of spiritual wrong,"
538,VI,"Built by an unjust nation sheer and strong,"
539,VI,Expugnable but by a nation's rue
540,VI,And bowing down before that equal shrine
541,VI,"By all men held divine,"
542,VI,Whereof his band and he were the most holy sign.

551,VII,That swift and angry stave--
552,VII,Unmeet for this desirous morn--
553,VII,"That I have striven, striven to evade?"
554,VII,"Gazing on him, must I not deem they err"
555,VII,Whose careless lips in street and shop aver
556,VII,"As common tidings, deeds to make his cheek"
557,VII,"Flush from the bronze, and his dead throat to speak?"
558,VII,"Surely some elder singer would arise,"
559,VII,Whose harp hath leave to threaten and to mourn
560,VII,Above this people when they go astray.
561,VII,"Is Whitman, the strong spirit, overworn?"
562,VII,Has Whittier put his yearning wrath away?
563,VII,I will not and I dare not yet believe!
564,VII,"Though furtively the sunlight seems to grieve,"
565,VII,And the spring-laden breeze
566,VII,Out of the gladdening west is sinister
567,VII,With sounds of nameless battle overseas;
568,VII,Though when we turn and question in suspense
569,VII,"If these things be indeed after these ways,"
570,VII,"And what things are to follow after these,"
571,VII,Our fluent men of place and consequence
572,VII,"Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow phrase,"
573,VII,Or for the end-all of deep arguments
574,VII,Intone their dull commercial liturgies--
575,VII,I dare not yet believe! My ears are shut!
576,VII,I will not hear the thin satiric praise
577,VII,"And muffled laughter of our enemies,"
578,VII,Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword
579,VII,Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd
580,VII,Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut;
581,VII,Showing how wise it is to cast away
582,VII,"The symbols of our spiritual sway,"
583,VII,That so our hands with better ease
584,VII,May wield the driver's whip and grasp the jailer's keys.

592,VIII,"Mewing its mighty youth,"
593,VIII,"Soon to possess the mountain winds of truth,"
594,VIII,And be a swift familiar of the sun
595,VIII,Where aye before God's face his trumpets run?
596,VIII,"Or have we but the talons and the maw,"
597,VIII,And for the abject likeness of our heart
598,VIII,Shall some less lordly bird be set apart?--
599,VIII,Some gross-billed wader where the swamps are fat?

616,IX,"Beautiful armies. Oh, by the sweet blood and young"
617,IX,"Shed on the awful hill slope at San Juan,"
618,IX,By the unforgotten names of eager boys
619,IX,Who might have tasted girls' love and been stung
620,IX,With the old mystic joys
621,IX,"And starry griefs, now the spring nights come on,"
622,IX,"But that the heart of youth is generous,--"
623,IX,"We charge you, ye who lead us,"
624,IX,Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain!
625,IX,Turn not their new-world victories to gain!
626,IX,One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays
627,IX,"Of their dear praise,"
628,IX,"One jot of their pure conquest put to hire,"
629,IX,The implacable republic will require;
630,IX,"With clamor, in the glare and gaze of noon,"
631,IX,"Or subtly, coming as a thief at night,"
632,IX,"But surely, very surely, slow or soon"
633,IX,That insult deep we deeply will requite.
634,IX,"Tempt not our weakness, our cupidity!"
635,IX,"For save we let the island men go free,"
636,IX,Those baffled and dislaureled ghosts
637,IX,Will curse us from the lamentable coasts
638,IX,Where walk the frustrate dead.
639,IX,"The cup of trembling shall be drainèd quite,"
640,IX,"Eaten the sour bread of astonishment,"
641,IX,With ashes of the hearth shall be made white
642,IX,"Our hair, and wailing shall be in the tent;"
643,IX,Then on your guiltier head
644,IX,Shall our intolerable self-disdain
645,IX,Wreak suddenly its anger and its pain;
646,IX,For manifest in that disastrous light
647,IX,We shall discern the right
648,IX,"And do it, tardily.--O ye who lead,"

766,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Before he knows how much he might have missed
767,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,That other boys have got! The bitterest thought
768,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of all that plagued me when he came was this,"
769,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"How some day he would see the difference,"
770,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And drag himself to me with puzzled eyes
771,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To ask me why it was. He would have been
772,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Cruel enough to do it, knowing not"
773,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,That was the question my rebellious heart
774,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Cried over and over one whole year to God,"
775,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And got no answer and no help at all.
776,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"If he had asked me, what could I have said?"
777,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,What single word could I have found to say
778,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To hide me from his searching, puzzled gaze?"
779,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Some coward thing at best, never the truth;"
780,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The truth I never could have told him. No,"
781,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I never could have said, ""God gave you me"
782,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To fashion you a body, right and strong,"
783,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,With sturdy little limbs and chest and neck
784,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"For fun and fighting with your little mates,"
785,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Great feats and voyages in the breathless world
786,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of out-of-doors,--He gave you me for this,"
787,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And I was such a bungler, that is all!"""
788,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"O, the old lie--that thought was not the worst."
789,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I never have been truthful with myself.
790,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For by the door where lurked one ghostly thought
791,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I stood with crazy hands to thrust it back
792,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,If it should dare to peep and whisper out
793,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Unbearable things about me, hearing which"
794,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The women passing in the streets would turn
795,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To pity me and scold me with their eyes,"
796,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Who was so bad a mother and so slow
797,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To learn to help God do his wonder in her
798,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,That she--O my sweet baby! It was not
799,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The fear that you would see the difference
800,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Between you and the other boys and girls;
801,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"No, no, it was the dimmer, wilder fear,"
802,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"That you might never see it, never look"
803,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Out of your tiny baby-house of mind,"
804,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But sit your life through, quiet in the dark,"
805,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Smiling and nodding at what was not there!
806,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,A foolish fear: God could not punish so.
807,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Yet until yesterday I thought He would.
808,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,My soul was always cowering at the blow
809,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I saw suspended, ready to be dealt"
810,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The moment that I showed my fear too much.
811,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Therefore I hid it from Him all I could,"
812,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And only stole a shaking glance at it
813,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Sometimes in the dead minutes before dawn
814,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,When He forgets to watch. Till yesterday.
815,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For yesterday was wonderful and strange
816,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,From the beginning. When I wakened first
817,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And looked out at the window, the last snow"
818,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Was gone from earth; about the apple-trees
819,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Hung a faint mist of bloom; small sudden green
820,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Had run and spread and rippled everywhere
821,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Over the fields; and in the level sun
822,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Walked something like a presence and a power,"
823,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses
824,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To all the world, but chiefly unto me."
825,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"It walked before me when I went to work,"
826,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And all day long the noises of the mill
827,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Were spun upon a core of golden sound,"
828,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Half-spoken words and interrupted songs
829,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of blessed promise, meant for all the world,"
830,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But most for me, because I suffered most."
831,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The shooting spindles, the smooth-humming wheels,"
832,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The rocking webs, seemed toiling to some end"
833,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Beneficent and human known to them,"
834,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And duly brought to pass in power and love.
835,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The faces of the girls and men at work
836,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Met mine with intense greeting, veiled at once,"
837,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,As if they knew a secret they must keep
838,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For fear the joy would harm me if they told
839,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Before some inkling filtered to my mind
840,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,In roundabout ways. When the day's work was done
841,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,There lay a special silence on the fields;
842,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And, as I passed, the bushes and the trees,"
843,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The very ruts and puddles of the road
844,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Spoke to each other, saying it was she,"
845,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The happy woman, the elected one,"
846,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The vessel of strange mercy and the sign
847,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Of many loving wonders done in Heaven
848,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To help the piteous earth.
849,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
850,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,At last I stopped
851,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And looked about me in sheer wonderment.
852,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,What did it mean? What did they want with me?
853,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,What was the matter with the evening now
854,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,That it was just as bound to make me glad
855,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,As morning and the live-long day had been?
856,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Me, who had quite forgot what gladness was,"
857,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Who had no right to anything but toil,"
858,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And food and sleep for strength to toil again,"
859,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And that fierce frightened anguish of my love
860,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For the poor little spirit I had wronged
861,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,With life that was no life. What had befallen
862,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Since yesterday? No need to stop and ask!
863,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Back there in the dark places of my mind
864,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Where I had thrust it, fearing to believe"
865,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"An unbelievable mercy, shone the news"
866,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Told by the village neighbors coming home
867,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Last night from the great city, of a man"
868,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Arisen, like the first evangelists,"
869,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"With power to heal the bodies of the sick,"
870,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"In testimony of his master Christ,"
871,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Who heals the soul when it is sick with sin.
872,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Could such a thing be true in these hard days?
873,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Was help still sent in such a way as that?
874,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"No, no! I did not dare to think of it,"
875,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Feeling what weakness and despair would come
876,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,After the crazy hope broke under me.
877,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I turned and started homeward, faster now,"
878,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,But never fast enough to leave behind
879,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The voices and the troubled happiness
880,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"That still kept mounting, mounting like a sea,"
881,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And singing far-off like a rush of wings.
882,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Far down the road a yellow spot of light
883,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Shone from my cottage window, rayless yet,"
884,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes.
885,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Alice had lit the lamp before she went;
886,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Her day of pity and unmirthful play
887,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Was over, and her young heart free to live"
888,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task
889,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Again, and made her feel how dark and still"
890,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,That life could be to others which to her
891,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Was full of dreams that beckoned, reaching hands,"
892,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And thrilling invitations young girls hear.
893,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"My boy was sleeping, little mind and frame"
894,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,More tired just lying there awake two hours
895,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Than with a whole day's romp he should have been.
896,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,He would not know his mother had come home;
897,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,But after supper I would sit awhile
898,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Beside his bed, and let my heart have time"
899,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For that worst love that stabs and breaks and kills.
900,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,This I thought over to myself by rote
901,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And habit, but I could not feel my thoughts;"
902,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,For still that dim unmeaning happiness
903,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Kept mounting, mounting round me like a sea,"
904,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And singing inward like a wind of wings.
905,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
906,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Before I lifted up the latch, I knew."
907,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I felt no fear; the One who waited there
908,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"In the low lamplight by the bed, had come"
909,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Because I was his sister and in need.
910,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"My word had got to Him somehow at last,"
911,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And He had come to help me or to tell
912,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Where help was to be found. It was not strange.
913,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Strange only He had stayed away so long;
914,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,But that should be forgotten--He was here.
915,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I pushed the door wide open and looked in.
916,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"He had been kneeling by the bed, and now,"
917,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Half-risen, kissed my boy upon the lips,"
918,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand.
919,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I must have fallen on the threshold stone,"
920,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"For I remember that I felt, not saw,"
921,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The resurrection glory and the peace
922,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Shed from his face and raiment as He went
923,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Out by the door into the evening street.
924,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But when I looked, the place about the bed"
925,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Was yet all bathed in light, and in the midst"
926,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"My boy lay changed,--no longer clothed upon"
927,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"With scraps and shreds of life, but like the child"
928,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Of some most fortunate mother. In a breath
929,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The image faded. There he lay again
930,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The same as always; and the light was gone.
931,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I sank with moans and cries beside the bed.
932,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The cruelty, O Christ, the cruelty!"
933,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To come at last and then to go like that,"
934,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Leaving the darkness deeper than before!
935,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Then, though I heard no sound, I grew aware"
936,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Of some one standing by the open door
937,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Among the dry vines rustling in the porch.
938,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,My heart laughed suddenly. He had come back!
939,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,He had come back to make the vision true.
940,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"He had not meant to mock me: God was God,"
941,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And Christ was Christ; there was no falsehood there.
942,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I heard a quiet footstep cross the room
943,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And felt a hand laid gently on my hair,--"
944,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"A human hand, worn hard by daily toil,"
945,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Heavy with life-long struggle after bread.
946,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Alice's father. The kind homely voice
947,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Had in it such strange music that I dreamed
948,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him,"
949,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Because His own bright form had made me swoon
950,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,With its too much of glory. What he brought
951,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Was news as good as ever heavenly lips
952,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Had the dear right to utter. He had been
953,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,All day among the crowds of curious folk
954,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,From the great city and the country-side
955,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Gathered to watch the Healer do his work
956,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind,"
957,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And with his very eyes had seen such things
958,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,As awestruck men had witnessed long ago
959,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"In Galilee, and writ of in the Book."
960,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To-morrow morning he would take me there
961,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,If I had strength and courage to believe.
962,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"It might be there was hope; he could not say,"
963,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,But knew what he had seen. When he was gone
964,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I lay for hours, letting the solemn waves"
965,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Thundering joy go over and over me.
966,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
967,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Just before midnight baby fretted, woke;"
968,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,He never yet has slept a whole night through
969,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Without his food and petting. As I sat
970,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Feeding and petting him and singing soft,"
971,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I felt a jealousy begin to ache
972,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And worry at my heartstrings, hushing down"
973,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The gladness. Jealousy of what or whom?
974,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I hardly knew, or could not put in words;"
975,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,At least it seemed too foolish and too wrong
976,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"When said, and so I shut the thought away."
977,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Only, next minute, it came stealing back."
978,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"After the change, would my boy be the same"
979,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"As this one? Would he be my boy at all,"
980,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And not another's--his who gave the life
981,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I could not give, or did not anyhow?"
982,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,How could I look in his new eyes to claim
983,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The whole of him, the body and the breath,"
984,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"When some one not his mother, a strange man,"
985,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Had clothed him in that beauty of the flesh--
986,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Perhaps (for who could know?), perhaps, by some"
987,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Hateful disfiguring miracle, had even"
988,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Transformed his spirit to a better one,"
989,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Better, but not the same I prayed for him"
990,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Down out of Heaven through the sleepless nights,--"
991,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The best that God would send to such as me.
992,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I tried to strangle back the wicked pain;
993,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Fancied him changed and tried to love him so.
994,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"No use; it was another, not my child,"
995,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Not my frail, broken, priceless little one,"
996,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"My cup of anguish, and my trembling star"
997,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Hung small and sad and sweet above the earth,"
998,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,So sure to fall but for my cherishing!
999,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1000,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"When he had dropped asleep again, I rose"
1001,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And wrestled with the sinful selfishness,"
1002,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The dark injustice, the unnatural pain."
1003,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Fevered at last with pacing to and fro,"
1004,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I raised the bedroom window and leaned out.
1005,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The white moon, low behind the sycamores,"
1006,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Silvered the silent country; not a voice
1007,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Of all the myriads summer moves to sing
1008,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Had yet awakened; in the level moon
1009,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Walked that same presence I had heard at dawn
1010,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses,"
1011,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But now, dispirited and reticent,"
1012,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,It walked the moonlight like a homeless thing.
1013,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"O, how to cleanse me of the cowardice!"
1014,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"How to be just! Was I a mother, then,"
1015,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"A mother, and not love her child as well"
1016,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,As her own covetous and morbid love?
1017,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Was it for this the Comforter had come,"
1018,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Smiling at me and pointing with His hand?
1019,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"--What had He meant to have me think or do,"
1020,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Smiling and pointing?
1021,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1022,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,All at once I saw
1023,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,A way to save my darling from myself
1024,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And make atonement for my grudging love!
1025,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Under the sycamores and up the hill
1026,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And down across the river, the wet road"
1027,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Went stretching cityward, silvered in the moon."
1028,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I who had shrunk from sacrifice, even I,"
1029,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Who had refused God's blessing for my boy,"
1030,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Would take him in my arms and carry him
1031,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Up to the altar of the miracle.
1032,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"I would not wait for daylight, nor the help"
1033,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of any human friendship; I alone,"
1034,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Through the still miles of country, I alone,"
1035,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Only my arms to shield him and my feet
1036,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To bear him: he should have no one to thank
1037,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But me for that. I knew the way was long,"
1038,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,But knew strength would be given. So I came.
1039,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Soon the stars failed; the late moon faded too:
1040,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I think my heart had sucked their beams from them
1041,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,To build more blue amid the murky night
1042,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Its own miraculous day. From creeks and fields
1043,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The fog climbed slowly, blotted out the road;"
1044,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And hid the signposts telling of the town;
1045,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"After a while rain fell, with sleet and snow."
1046,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,What did I care? Baby was snug and dry.
1047,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Some day, when I was telling him of this,"
1048,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"He would but hug me closer, hearing how"
1049,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The night conspired against us. Better hard
1050,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Than easy, then: I almost felt regret"
1051,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,My body was so capable and strong
1052,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"To do its errand. Honeyed drop by drop,"
1053,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The ghostly jealousy, loosening at my breast,"
1054,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Distilled into a dew of quiet tears
1055,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And fell with splash of music in the wells
1056,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And on the hidden rivers of my soul.
1057,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1058,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The hardest part was coming through the town.
1059,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The country, even when it hindered most,"
1060,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Seemed conscious of the thing I went to find.
1061,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The rocks and bushes looming through the mist
1062,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Questioned and acquiesced and understood;
1063,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The trees and streams believed; the wind and rain,"
1064,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Even they, for all their temper, had some words"
1065,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Of faith and comfort. But the glaring streets,"
1066,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"The dizzy traffic, the piled merchandise,"
1067,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The giant buildings swarming with fierce life--
1068,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Cared nothing for me. They had never heard
1069,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Of me nor of my business. When I asked
1070,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"My way, a shade of pity or contempt"
1071,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Showed through men's kindness--for they all were kind.
1072,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Daunted and chilled and very sick at heart,"
1073,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,I walked the endless pavements. But at last
1074,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,The streets grew quieter; the houses seemed
1075,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,As if they might be homes where people lived;
1076,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Then came the factories and cottages,"
1077,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"And all was well again. Much more than well,"
1078,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"For many sick and broken went my way,"
1079,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Alone or helped along by loving hands;
1080,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And from a thousand eyes the famished hope
1081,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Looked out at mine--wild, patient, querulous,"
1082,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"But always hope and hope, a thousand tongues"
1083,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Speaking one word in many languages.
1084,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1085,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"In two hours He will come, they say, will stand"
1086,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"There on the steps, above the waiting crowd,"
1087,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,And touch with healing hands whoever asks
1088,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Believingly, in spirit and in truth."
1089,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Can such a mercy be, in these hard days?"
1090,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,Is help still sent in such a way as that?
1091,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,"Christ, I believe; pity my unbelief!"
1092,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1093,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1094,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1095,UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS,
1096,JETSAM,JETSAM
1097,JETSAM,
1098,JETSAM,
1099,JETSAM,I wonder can this be the world it was
1100,JETSAM,At sunset? I remember the sky fell
1101,JETSAM,"Green as pale meadows, at the long street-ends,"
1102,JETSAM,But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs
1103,JETSAM,As if to shut the city from God's eyes
1104,JETSAM,Till dawn should quench the laughter and the lights.
1105,JETSAM,"Beneath the gas flare stolid faces passed,"
1106,JETSAM,Too dull for sin; old loosened lips set hard
1107,JETSAM,To drain the stale lees from the cup of sense;
1108,JETSAM,Or if a young face yearned from out the mist
1109,JETSAM,"Made by its own bright hair, the eyes were wan"
1110,JETSAM,With desolate fore-knowledge of the end.
1111,JETSAM,"My life lay waste about me: as I walked,"
1112,JETSAM,From the gross dark of unfrequented streets
1113,JETSAM,"The face of my own youth peered forth at me,"
1114,JETSAM,Struck white with pity at the thing I was;
1115,JETSAM,"And globed in ghostly fire, thrice-virginal,"
1116,JETSAM,"With lifted face star-strong, went one who sang"
1117,JETSAM,Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.
1118,JETSAM,Out of the void dark came my face and hers
1119,JETSAM,One vivid moment--then the street was there;
1120,JETSAM,Bloat shapes and mean eyes blotted the sear dusk;
1121,JETSAM,And in the curtained window of a house
1122,JETSAM,"Whence sin reeked on the night, a shameful head"
1123,JETSAM,Was silhouetted black as Satan's face
1124,JETSAM,Against eternal fires. I stumbled on
1125,JETSAM,"Down the dark slope that reaches riverward,"
1126,JETSAM,Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God
1127,JETSAM,And crush Him in his lies. The river lay
1128,JETSAM,Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees.
1129,JETSAM,All was too hateful--I could not die there!
1130,JETSAM,"I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast,"
1131,JETSAM,Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn.
1132,JETSAM,So under the thin willows' leprous shade
1133,JETSAM,And through the tangled ranks of riverweed
1134,JETSAM,"I pushed--till lo, God heard me! I came forth"
1135,JETSAM,"Where, 'neath the shoreless hush of region light,"
1136,JETSAM,"Through a new world, undreamed of, undesired,"
1137,JETSAM,"Beyond imagining of man's weary heart,"
1138,JETSAM,Far to the white marge of the wondering sea
1139,JETSAM,"This still plain widens, and this moon rains down"
1140,JETSAM,Insufferable ecstasy of peace.
1141,JETSAM,
1142,JETSAM,"My heart is man's heart, strong to bear this night's"
1143,JETSAM,Unspeakable affliction of mute love
1144,JETSAM,That crazes lesser things. The rocks and clods
1145,JETSAM,"Dissemble, feign a busy intercourse;"
1146,JETSAM,"The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge,"
1147,JETSAM,"Lurk dull, dart spiteful out, make heartless signs,"
1148,JETSAM,"Utter awestricken purpose of no sense,--"
1149,JETSAM,"But I walk quiet, crush aside the hands"
1150,JETSAM,Stretched furtively to drag me madmen's ways.
1151,JETSAM,"I know the thing they suffer, and the tricks"
1152,JETSAM,They must be at to help themselves endure.
1153,JETSAM,"I would not be too boastful; I am weak,"
1154,JETSAM,Too weak to put aside the utter ache
1155,JETSAM,Of this lone splendor long enough to see
1156,JETSAM,Whether the moon is still her white strange self
1157,JETSAM,"Or something whiter, stranger, even the face"
1158,JETSAM,Which by the changed face of my risen youth
1159,JETSAM,"Sang, globed in fire, her golden canticle."
1160,JETSAM,I dare not look again; another gaze
1161,JETSAM,"Might drive me to the wavering coppice there,"
1162,JETSAM,"Where bat-winged madness brushed me, the wild laugh"
1163,JETSAM,Of naked nature crashed across my blood.
1164,JETSAM,"So rank it was with earthy presences,"
1165,JETSAM,"Faun-shapes in goatish dance, young witches' eyes"
1166,JETSAM,"Slanting deep invitation, whinnying calls"
1167,JETSAM,"Ambiguous, shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth,--"
1168,JETSAM,"They had undone me in the darkness there,"
1169,JETSAM,"But that within me, smiting through my lids"
1170,JETSAM,"Lowered to shut in the thick whirl of sense,"
1171,JETSAM,"The dumb light ached and rummaged, and with out,"
1172,JETSAM,The soaring splendor summoned me aloud
1173,JETSAM,To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh
1174,JETSAM,"Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him,"
1175,JETSAM,"For spirit reaches of the strenuous vast,"
1176,JETSAM,Where stalwart stars reap grain to make the bread
1177,JETSAM,God breaketh at his tables and is glad.
1178,JETSAM,"I came out in the moonlight cleansed and strong,"
1179,JETSAM,And gazed up at the lyric face to see
1180,JETSAM,All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups
1181,JETSAM,"Ere it be dashed and spilled, all radiance flung"
1182,JETSAM,"Beyond experience, every benison dream,"
1183,JETSAM,Treasured and mystically crescent there.
1184,JETSAM,
1185,JETSAM,"O, who will shield me from her? Who will place"
1186,JETSAM,A veil between me and the fierce in-throng
1187,JETSAM,Of her inexorable benedicite?
1188,JETSAM,"See, I have loved her well and been with her!"
1189,JETSAM,Through tragic twilights when the stricken sea
1190,JETSAM,"Groveled with fear, or when she made her throne"
1191,JETSAM,In imminent cities built of gorgeous winds
1192,JETSAM,And paved with lightnings; or when the sobering stars
1193,JETSAM,Would lead her home 'mid wealth of plundered May
1194,JETSAM,Along the violet slopes of evensong.
1195,JETSAM,"Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year,"
1196,JETSAM,For me one sight stood peerless and apart:
1197,JETSAM,Bright rivers tacit; low hills prone and dumb;
1198,JETSAM,Forests that hushed their tiniest voice to hear;
1199,JETSAM,Skies for the unutterable advent robed
1200,JETSAM,In purple like the opening iris buds;
1201,JETSAM,"And by some lone expectant pool, one tree"
1202,JETSAM,"Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe,--"
1203,JETSAM,"As with preluding gush of amber light,"
1204,JETSAM,"And herald trumpets softly lifted through,"
1205,JETSAM,Across the palpitant horizon marge
1206,JETSAM,Crocus-filleted came the singing moon.
1207,JETSAM,Out of her changing lights I wove my youth
1208,JETSAM,"A place to dwell in, sweet and spiritual,"
1209,JETSAM,And all the bitter years of my exile
1210,JETSAM,My heart has called afar off unto her.
1211,JETSAM,"Lo, after many days love finds its own!"
1212,JETSAM,"The futile adorations, the waste tears,"
1213,JETSAM,"The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn,"
1214,JETSAM,She has uptreasured as a lover's gifts;
1215,JETSAM,They are the mystic garment that she wears
1216,JETSAM,"Against the bridal, and the crocus flowers"
1217,JETSAM,She twined her brow with at the going forth;
1218,JETSAM,They are the burden of the song she made
1219,JETSAM,"In coming through the quiet fields of space,"
1220,JETSAM,And breathe between her passion-parted lips
1221,JETSAM,Calling me out along the flowering road
1222,JETSAM,Which summers through the dimness of the sea.
1223,JETSAM,
1224,JETSAM,"Hark, where the deep feels round its thousand shores"
1225,JETSAM,"To find remembered respite, and far drawn"
1226,JETSAM,Through weed-strewn shelves and crannies of the coast
1227,JETSAM,The myriad silence yearns to myriad speech.
1228,JETSAM,"O sea that yearns a day, shall thy tongues be"
1229,JETSAM,"So eloquent, and heart, shall all thy tongues"
1230,JETSAM,Be dumb to speak thy longing? Say I hold
1231,JETSAM,"Life as a broken jewel in my hand,"
1232,JETSAM,And fain would buy a little love with it
1233,JETSAM,"For comfort, say I fain would make it shine"
1234,JETSAM,"Once in remembering eyes ere it be dust,--"
1235,JETSAM,"Were life not worthy spent? Then what of this,"
1236,JETSAM,When all my spirit hungers to repay
1237,JETSAM,The beauty that has drenched my soul with peace?
1238,JETSAM,Once at a simple turning of the way
1239,JETSAM,I met God walking; and although the dawn
1240,JETSAM,"Was large behind Him, and the morning stars"
1241,JETSAM,Circled and sang about his face as birds
1242,JETSAM,"About the fieldward morning cottager,"
1243,JETSAM,"My coward heart said faintly, ""Let us haste!"
1244,JETSAM,"Day grows and it is far to market-town."""
1245,JETSAM,"Once where I lay in darkness after fight,"
1246,JETSAM,"Sore smitten, thrilled a little thread of song"
1247,JETSAM,Searching and searching at my muffled sense
1248,JETSAM,"Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood,"
1249,JETSAM,And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire
1250,JETSAM,"Singing, star-strong, her golden canticle;"
1251,JETSAM,"And her mouth sang, ""The hosts of Hate roll past,"
1252,JETSAM,A dance of dust motes in the sliding sun;
1253,JETSAM,"Love's battle comes on the wide wings of storm,"
1254,JETSAM,"From east to west one legion! Wilt thou strive?"""
1255,JETSAM,"Then, since the splendor of her sword-bright gaze"
1256,JETSAM,Was heavy on me with yearning and with scorn
1257,JETSAM,"My sick heart muttered, ""Yea, the little strife,"
1258,JETSAM,"Yet see, the grievous wounds! I fain would sleep."""
1259,JETSAM,"O heart, shalt thou not once be strong to go"
1260,JETSAM,"Where all sweet throats are calling, once be brave"
1261,JETSAM,To slake with deed thy dumbness? Let us go
1262,JETSAM,"The path her singing face looms low to point,"
1263,JETSAM,"Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame"
1264,JETSAM,Of silver on the brown grope of the flood;
1265,JETSAM,For all my spirit's soilure is put by
1266,JETSAM,"And all my body's soilure, lacking now"
1267,JETSAM,But the last lustral sacrament of death
1268,JETSAM,To make me clean for those near-searching eyes
1269,JETSAM,"That question yonder whether all be well,"
1270,JETSAM,And pause a little ere they dare rejoice.
1271,JETSAM,
1272,JETSAM,"Question and be thou answered, passionate face!"
1273,JETSAM,"For I am worthy, worthy now at last"
1274,JETSAM,After so long unworth; strong now at last
1275,JETSAM,To give myself to beauty and be saved;
1276,JETSAM,"Now, being man, to give myself to thee,"
1277,JETSAM,As once the tumult of my boyish heart
1278,JETSAM,"Companioned thee with rapture through the world,"
1279,JETSAM,Forth from a land whereof no poet's lip
1280,JETSAM,"Made mention how the leas were lily-sprent,"
1281,JETSAM,Into a land God's eyes had looked not on
1282,JETSAM,To love the tender bloom upon the hills.
1283,JETSAM,"To-morrow, when the fishers come at dawn"
1284,JETSAM,Upon that shell of me the sea has tossed
1285,JETSAM,"To land, as fit for earth to use again,"
1286,JETSAM,"Men, meeting at the shops and corner streets,"
1287,JETSAM,"Will speak a word of pity, glossing o'er"
1288,JETSAM,"With altered accent, dubious sweep of hand,"
1289,JETSAM,"Their virile, just contempt for one who failed."
1290,JETSAM,"But they can never cast my earnings up,"
1291,JETSAM,Who know so well my losses. Even you
1292,JETSAM,Who in the mild light of the spirit walk
1293,JETSAM,"And hold yourselves acquainted with the truth,"
1294,JETSAM,Be not too swift to judge and cast me out!
1295,JETSAM,"You shall find other, nobler ways than mine"
1296,JETSAM,"To work your soul's redemption,--glorious noons"
1297,JETSAM,"Of battle 'neath the heaven-suspended sign,"
1298,JETSAM,And nightly refuge 'neath God's ægis-rim;
1299,JETSAM,"Increase of wisdom, and acquaintance held"
1300,JETSAM,"With the heart's austerities; still governance,"
1301,JETSAM,And ripening of the blood in the weekday sun
1302,JETSAM,To make the full-orbed consecrated fruit
1303,JETSAM,At life's end for the Sabbath supper meet.
1304,JETSAM,"I shall not sit beside you at that feast,"
1305,JETSAM,For ere a seedling of my golden tree
1306,JETSAM,"Pushed off its petals to get room to grow,"
1307,JETSAM,I stripped the boughs to make an April gaud
1308,JETSAM,And wreathe a spendthrift garland for my hair.
1309,JETSAM,But mine is not the failure God deplores;
1310,JETSAM,"For I of old am beauty's votarist,"
1311,JETSAM,"Long recreant, often foiled and led astray,"
1312,JETSAM,But resolute at last to seek her there
1313,JETSAM,"Where most she does abide, and crave with tears"
1314,JETSAM,That she assoil me of my blemishment.
1315,JETSAM,"Low looms her singing face to point the way,"
1316,JETSAM,"Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame"
1317,JETSAM,Of silver on the brown grope of the flood.
1318,JETSAM,The stars are for me; the horizon wakes
1319,JETSAM,Its pilgrim chanting; and the little sand
1320,JETSAM,Grows musical of hope beneath my feet.
1321,JETSAM,The waves that leap to meet my swimming breast
1322,JETSAM,"Gossip sweet secrets of the light-drenched way,"
1323,JETSAM,And when the deep throbs of the rising surge
1324,JETSAM,"Pulse upward with me, and a rain of wings"
1325,JETSAM,"Blurs round the moon's pale place, she stoops to reach"
1326,JETSAM,"Still welcome of bright hands across the wave,"
1327,JETSAM,"And sings low, low, globed all in ghostly fire,"
1328,JETSAM,Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.
1329,JETSAM,
1330,JETSAM,
1331,JETSAM,
1332,JETSAM,
1333,THE BRUTE,THE BRUTE
1334,THE BRUTE,
1335,THE BRUTE,
1336,THE BRUTE,Through his might men work their wills.
1337,THE BRUTE,They have boweled out the hills
1338,THE BRUTE,For food to keep him toiling in the cages they have wrought;
1339,THE BRUTE,"And they fling him, hour by hour,"
1340,THE BRUTE,Limbs of men to give him power;
1341,THE BRUTE,Brains of men to give him cunning; and for dainties to devour
1342,THE BRUTE,"Children's souls, the little worth; hearts of women, cheaply bought:"
1343,THE BRUTE,"He takes them and he breaks them, but he gives them scanty thought."
1344,THE BRUTE,
1345,THE BRUTE,"For about the noisy land,"
1346,THE BRUTE,"Roaring, quivering 'neath his hand,"
1347,THE BRUTE,His thoughts brood fierce and sullen or laugh in lust of pride
1348,THE BRUTE,"O'er the stubborn things that he,"
1349,THE BRUTE,Breaks to dust and brings to be.
1350,THE BRUTE,"Some he mightily establishes, some flings down utterly."
1351,THE BRUTE,"There is thunder in his stride, nothing ancient can abide,"
1352,THE BRUTE,When he hales the hills together and bridles up the tide.
1353,THE BRUTE,
1354,THE BRUTE,"Quietude and loveliness,"
1355,THE BRUTE,"Holy sights that heal and bless,"
1356,THE BRUTE,They are scattered and abolished where his iron hoof is set;
1357,THE BRUTE,When he splashes through the brae
1358,THE BRUTE,"Silver streams are choked with clay,"
1359,THE BRUTE,When he snorts the bright cliffs crumble and the woods go down like
1360,THE BRUTE,hay;
1361,THE BRUTE,"He lairs in pleasant cities, and the haggard people fret"
1362,THE BRUTE,"Squalid 'mid their new-got riches, soot-begrimed and desolate."
1363,THE BRUTE,
1364,THE BRUTE,They who caught and bound him tight
1365,THE BRUTE,"Laughed exultant at his might,"
1366,THE BRUTE,"Saying, ""Now behold, the good time comes for the weariest and the"
1367,THE BRUTE,least!
1368,THE BRUTE,We will use this lusty knave:
1369,THE BRUTE,No more need for men to slave;
1370,THE BRUTE,"We may rise and look about us and have knowledge ere the grave."""
1371,THE BRUTE,"But the Brute said in his breast, ""Till the mills I grind have ceased,"
1372,THE BRUTE,"The riches shall be dust of dust, dry ashes be the feast!"
1373,THE BRUTE,
1374,THE BRUTE,"""On the strong and cunning few"
1375,THE BRUTE,Cynic favors I will strew;
1376,THE BRUTE,I will stuff their maw with overplus until their spirit dies;
1377,THE BRUTE,From the patient and the low
1378,THE BRUTE,I will take the joys they know;
1379,THE BRUTE,They shall hunger after vanities and still an-hungered go.
1380,THE BRUTE,"Madness shall be on the people, ghastly jealousies arise;"
1381,THE BRUTE,Brother's blood shall cry on brother up the dead and empty skies.
1382,THE BRUTE,
1383,THE BRUTE,"""I will burn and dig and hack"
1384,THE BRUTE,Till the heavens suffer lack;
1385,THE BRUTE,"God shall feel a pleasure fail him, crying to his cherubim,"
1386,THE BRUTE,'Who hath flung yon mud-ball there
1387,THE BRUTE,Where my world went green and fair?'
1388,THE BRUTE,"I shall laugh and hug me, hearing how his sentinels declare,"
1389,THE BRUTE,''T is the Brute they chained to labor! He has made the bright earth
1390,THE BRUTE,dim.
1391,THE BRUTE,"Store of wares and pelf a plenty, but they got no good of him.'"""
1392,THE BRUTE,
1393,THE BRUTE,So he plotted in his rage:
1394,THE BRUTE,"So he deals it, age by age."
1395,THE BRUTE,But even as he roared his curse a still small Voice befell;
1396,THE BRUTE,"Lo, a still and pleasant voice bade them none the less rejoice,"
1397,THE BRUTE,For the Brute must bring the good time on; he has no other choice.
1398,THE BRUTE,"He may struggle, sweat, and yell, but he knows exceeding well"
1399,THE BRUTE,He must work them out salvation ere they send him back to hell.
1400,THE BRUTE,
1401,THE BRUTE,All the desert that he made
1402,THE BRUTE,"He must treble bless with shade,"
1403,THE BRUTE,In primal wastes set precious seed of rapture and of pain;
1404,THE BRUTE,All the strongholds that he built
1405,THE BRUTE,For the powers of greed and guilt--
1406,THE BRUTE,He must strew their bastions down the sea and choke their towers with
1407,THE BRUTE,silt;
1408,THE BRUTE,"He must make the temples clean for the gods to come again,"
1409,THE BRUTE,And lift the lordly cities under skies without a stain.
1410,THE BRUTE,
1411,THE BRUTE,In a very cunning tether
1412,THE BRUTE,He must lead the tyrant weather;
1413,THE BRUTE,He must loose the curse of Adam from the worn neck of the race;
1414,THE BRUTE,"He must cast out hate and fear,"
1415,THE BRUTE,"Dry away each fruitless tear,"
1416,THE BRUTE,And make the fruitful tears to gush from the deep heart and clear.
1417,THE BRUTE,"He must give each man his portion, each his pride and worthy place;"
1418,THE BRUTE,"He must batter down the arrogant and lift the weary face,"
1419,THE BRUTE,"On each vile mouth set purity, on each low forehead grace."
1420,THE BRUTE,
1421,THE BRUTE,"Then, perhaps, at the last day,"
1422,THE BRUTE,"They will whistle him away,"
1423,THE BRUTE,"Lay a hand upon his muzzle in the face of God, and say,"
1424,THE BRUTE,"""Honor, Lord, the Thing we tamed!"
1425,THE BRUTE,Let him not be scourged or blamed.
1426,THE BRUTE,Even through his wrath and fierceness was thy fierce wroth world
1427,THE BRUTE,reclaimed!
1428,THE BRUTE,"Honor Thou thy servants' servant; let thy justice now be shown."""
1429,THE BRUTE,"Then the Lord will heed their saying, and the Brute come to his own,"
1430,THE BRUTE,"'Twixt the Lion and the Eagle, by the armpost of the Throne."
1431,THE BRUTE,
1432,THE BRUTE,
1433,THE BRUTE,
1434,THE BRUTE,
1435,THE MENAGERIE,THE MENAGERIE
1436,THE MENAGERIE,
1437,THE MENAGERIE,
1438,THE MENAGERIE,Thank God my brain is not inclined to cut
1439,THE MENAGERIE,Such capers every day! I 'm just about
1440,THE MENAGERIE,"Mellow, but then--There goes the tent-flap shut."
1441,THE MENAGERIE,Rain 's in the wind. I thought so: every snout
1442,THE MENAGERIE,Was twitching when the keeper turned me out.
1443,THE MENAGERIE,
1444,THE MENAGERIE,That screaming parrot makes my blood run cold.
1445,THE MENAGERIE,Gabriel's trump! the big bull elephant
1446,THE MENAGERIE,"Squeals ""Rain!"" to the parched herd. The monkeys scold,"
1447,THE MENAGERIE,And jabber that it 's rain water they want.
1448,THE MENAGERIE,(It makes me sick to see a monkey pant.)
1449,THE MENAGERIE,
1450,THE MENAGERIE,"I 'll foot it home, to try and make believe"
1451,THE MENAGERIE,"I 'm sober. After this I stick to beer,"
1452,THE MENAGERIE,And drop the circus when the sane folks leave.
1453,THE MENAGERIE,A man 's a fool to look at things too near:
1454,THE MENAGERIE,"They look back, and begin to cut up queer."
1455,THE MENAGERIE,
1456,THE MENAGERIE,"Beasts do, at any rate; especially"
1457,THE MENAGERIE,Wild devils caged. They have the coolest way
1458,THE MENAGERIE,Of being something else than what you see:
1459,THE MENAGERIE,"You pass a sleek young zebra nosing hay,"
1460,THE MENAGERIE,"A nylghau looking bored and distingué,--"
1461,THE MENAGERIE,
1462,THE MENAGERIE,And think you 've seen a donkey and a bird.
1463,THE MENAGERIE,"Not on your life! Just glance back, if you dare."
1464,THE MENAGERIE,"The zebra chews, the nylghau has n't stirred;"
1465,THE MENAGERIE,"But something 's happened, Heaven knows what or where,"
1466,THE MENAGERIE,To freeze your scalp and pompadour your hair.
1467,THE MENAGERIE,
1468,THE MENAGERIE,I 'm not precisely an æolian lute
1469,THE MENAGERIE,"Hung in the wandering winds of sentiment,"
1470,THE MENAGERIE,"But drown me if the ugliest, meanest brute"
1471,THE MENAGERIE,Grunting and fretting in that sultry tent
1472,THE MENAGERIE,Did n't just floor me with embarrassment!
1473,THE MENAGERIE,
1474,THE MENAGERIE,"'T was like a thunder-clap from out the clear,"
1475,THE MENAGERIE,"One minute they were circus beasts, some grand,"
1476,THE MENAGERIE,"Some ugly, some amusing, and some queer:"
1477,THE MENAGERIE,"Rival attractions to the hobo band,"
1478,THE MENAGERIE,"The flying jenny, and the peanut stand."
1479,THE MENAGERIE,
1480,THE MENAGERIE,Next minute they were old hearth-mates of mine!
1481,THE MENAGERIE,"Lost people, eyeing me with such a stare!"
1482,THE MENAGERIE,"Patient, satiric, devilish, divine;"
1483,THE MENAGERIE,"A gaze of hopeless envy, squalid care,"
1484,THE MENAGERIE,"Hatred, and thwarted love, and dim despair."
1485,THE MENAGERIE,
1486,THE MENAGERIE,"Within my blood my ancient kindred spoke,--"
1487,THE MENAGERIE,"Grotesque and monstrous voices, heard afar"
1488,THE MENAGERIE,"Down ocean caves when behemoth awoke,"
1489,THE MENAGERIE,Or through fern forests roared the plesiosaur
1490,THE MENAGERIE,Locked with the giant-bat in ghastly war.
1491,THE MENAGERIE,
1492,THE MENAGERIE,"And suddenly, as in a flash of light,"
1493,THE MENAGERIE,I saw great Nature working out her plan;
1494,THE MENAGERIE,Through all her shapes from mastodon to mite
1495,THE MENAGERIE,"Forever groping, testing, passing on"
1496,THE MENAGERIE,To find at last the shape and soul of Man.
1497,THE MENAGERIE,
1498,THE MENAGERIE,"Till in the fullness of accomplished time,"
1499,THE MENAGERIE,"Comes brother Forepaugh, upon business bent,"
1500,THE MENAGERIE,"Tracks her through frozen and through torrid clime,"
1501,THE MENAGERIE,"And shows us, neatly labeled in a tent,"
1502,THE MENAGERIE,The stages of her huge experiment;
1503,THE MENAGERIE,
1504,THE MENAGERIE,Blabbing aloud her shy and reticent hours;
1505,THE MENAGERIE,"Dragging to light her blinking, slothful moods;"
1506,THE MENAGERIE,Publishing fretful seasons when her powers
1507,THE MENAGERIE,"Worked wild and sullen in her solitudes,"
1508,THE MENAGERIE,Or when her mordant laughter shook the woods.
1509,THE MENAGERIE,
1510,THE MENAGERIE,"Here, round about me, were her vagrant births;"
1511,THE MENAGERIE,"Sick dreams she had, fierce projects she essayed;"
1512,THE MENAGERIE,"Her qualms, her fiery prides, her crazy mirths;"
1513,THE MENAGERIE,"The troublings of her spirit as she strayed,"
1514,THE MENAGERIE,"Cringed, gloated, mocked, was lordly, was afraid,"
1515,THE MENAGERIE,
1516,THE MENAGERIE,On that long road she went to seek mankind;
1517,THE MENAGERIE,Here were the darkling coverts that she beat
1518,THE MENAGERIE,To find the Hider she was sent to find;
1519,THE MENAGERIE,Here the distracted footprints of her feet
1520,THE MENAGERIE,Whereby her soul's Desire she came to greet.
1521,THE MENAGERIE,
1522,THE MENAGERIE,"But why should they, her botch-work, turn about"
1523,THE MENAGERIE,"And stare disdain at me, her finished job?"
1524,THE MENAGERIE,Why was the place one vast suspended shout
1525,THE MENAGERIE,Of laughter? Why did all the daylight throb
1526,THE MENAGERIE,With soundless guffaw and dumb-stricken sob?
1527,THE MENAGERIE,
1528,THE MENAGERIE,Helpless I stood among those awful cages;
1529,THE MENAGERIE,"The beasts were walking loose, and I was bagged!"
1530,THE MENAGERIE,"I, I, last product of the toiling ages,"
1531,THE MENAGERIE,"Goal of heroic feet that never lagged,--"
1532,THE MENAGERIE,"A little man in trousers, slightly jagged."
1533,THE MENAGERIE,
1534,THE MENAGERIE,Deliver me from such another jury!
1535,THE MENAGERIE,The Judgment-day will be a picnic to 't.
1536,THE MENAGERIE,"Their satire was more dreadful than their fury,"
1537,THE MENAGERIE,And worst of all was just a kind of brute
1538,THE MENAGERIE,"Disgust, and giving up, and sinking mute."
1539,THE MENAGERIE,
1540,THE MENAGERIE,"Survival of the fittest, adaptation,"
1541,THE MENAGERIE,"And all their other evolution terms,"
1542,THE MENAGERIE,"Seem to omit one small consideration,"
1543,THE MENAGERIE,"To wit, that tumblebugs and angleworms"
1544,THE MENAGERIE,Have souls: there 's soul in everything that squirms.
1545,THE MENAGERIE,
1546,THE MENAGERIE,"And souls are restless, plagued, impatient things,"
1547,THE MENAGERIE,All dream and unaccountable desire;
1548,THE MENAGERIE,"Crawling, but pestered with the thought of wings;"
1549,THE MENAGERIE,Spreading through every inch of earth's old mire
1550,THE MENAGERIE,Mystical hanker after something higher.
1551,THE MENAGERIE,
1552,THE MENAGERIE,"Wishes _are_ horses, as I understand."
1553,THE MENAGERIE,I guess a wistful polyp that has strokes
1554,THE MENAGERIE,Of feeling faint to gallivant on land
1555,THE MENAGERIE,Will come to be a scandal to his folks;
1556,THE MENAGERIE,"Legs he will sprout, in spite of threats and jokes."
1557,THE MENAGERIE,
1558,THE MENAGERIE,And at the core of every life that crawls
1559,THE MENAGERIE,Or runs or flies or swims or vegetates--
1560,THE MENAGERIE,"Churning the mammoth's heart-blood, in the galls"
1561,THE MENAGERIE,"Of shark and tiger planting gorgeous hates,"
1562,THE MENAGERIE,Lighting the love of eagles for their mates;
1563,THE MENAGERIE,
1564,THE MENAGERIE,"Yes, in the dim brain of the jellied fish"
1565,THE MENAGERIE,That is and is not living--moved and stirred
1566,THE MENAGERIE,"From the beginning a mysterious wish,"
1567,THE MENAGERIE,"A vision, a command, a fatal Word:"
1568,THE MENAGERIE,"The name of Man was uttered, and they heard."
1569,THE MENAGERIE,
1570,THE MENAGERIE,Upward along the æons of old war
1571,THE MENAGERIE,"They sought him: wing and shank-bone, claw and bill"
1572,THE MENAGERIE,Were fashioned and rejected; wide and far
1573,THE MENAGERIE,They roamed the twilight jungles of their will;
1574,THE MENAGERIE,"But still they sought him, and desired him still."
1575,THE MENAGERIE,
1576,THE MENAGERIE,"Man they desired, but mind you, Perfect Man,"
1577,THE MENAGERIE,"The radiant and the loving, yet to be!"
1578,THE MENAGERIE,"I hardly wonder, when they came to scan"
1579,THE MENAGERIE,"The upshot of their strenuosity,"
1580,THE MENAGERIE,They gazed with mixed emotions upon _me_.
1581,THE MENAGERIE,
1582,THE MENAGERIE,"Well, my advice to you is, Face the creatures,"
1583,THE MENAGERIE,"Or spot them sideways with your weather eye,"
1584,THE MENAGERIE,Just to keep tab on their expansive features;
1585,THE MENAGERIE,It is n't pleasant when you 're stepping high
1586,THE MENAGERIE,To catch a giraffe smiling on the sly.
1587,THE MENAGERIE,
1588,THE MENAGERIE,"If nature made you graceful, don't get gay"
1589,THE MENAGERIE,Back-to before the hippopotamus;
1590,THE MENAGERIE,"If meek and godly, find some place to play"
1591,THE MENAGERIE,Besides right where three mad hyenas fuss:
1592,THE MENAGERIE,You may hear language that we won't discuss.
1593,THE MENAGERIE,
1594,THE MENAGERIE,"If you 're a sweet thing in a flower-bed hat,"
1595,THE MENAGERIE,"Or her best fellow with your tie tucked in,"
1596,THE MENAGERIE,Don't squander love's bright springtime girding at
1597,THE MENAGERIE,An old chimpanzee with an Irish chin:
1598,THE MENAGERIE,_There may be hidden meaning in his grin._

1604,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1605,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1606,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,All day he drowses by the sail
1607,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"With dreams of her, and all night long"
1608,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,The broken waters are at song
1609,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Of how she lingers, wild and pale,"
1610,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"When all the temple lights are dumb,"
1611,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,And weaves her spells to make him come.
1612,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1613,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"The wide sea traversed, he will stand"
1614,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"With straining eyes, until the shoal"
1615,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Green water from the prow shall roll
1616,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Upon the yellow strip of sand--
1617,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Searching some fern-hid tangled way
1618,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Into the forest old and grey.
1619,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1620,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Then he will leap upon the shore,"
1621,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"And cast one look up at the sun,"
1622,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Over his loosened locks will run
1623,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"The dawn breeze, and a bird will pour"
1624,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Its rapture out to make life seem
1625,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Too sweet to leave for such a dream.
1626,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1627,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,But all the swifter will he go
1628,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Through the pale, scattered asphodels,"
1629,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Down mote-hung dusk of olive dells,"
1630,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,To where the ancient basins throw
1631,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Fleet threads of blue and trembling zones
1632,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Of gold upon the temple stones.
1633,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1634,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,There noon keeps just a twilight trace;
1635,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Twixt love and hate, and death and birth,"
1636,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,No man may choose; nor sobs nor mirth
1637,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,May enter in that haunted place.
1638,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,All day the fountain sphynx lets drip
1639,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Slow drops of silence from her lip.
1640,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1641,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,To hold the porch-roof slender girls
1642,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Of milk-white marble stand arow;
1643,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Doubt never blurs a single brow,"
1644,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,And never the noon's faintness curls
1645,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,From their expectant hush of pride
1646,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,The lips the god has glorified.
1647,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1648,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"But these things he will barely view,"
1649,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Or if he stay to heed them, still"
1650,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,But as the lark the lights that spill
1651,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"From out the sun it soars unto,"
1652,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Where, past the splendors and the heats,"
1653,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,The sun's heart's self forever beats.
1654,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1655,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,For wide the brazen doors will swing
1656,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Soon as his sandals touch the pave;
1657,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,The anxious light inside will wave
1658,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,And tremble to a lunar ring
1659,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,About the form that lieth prone
1660,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Before the dreadful altar-stone.
1661,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1662,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"She will not look or speak or stir,"
1663,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,But with drowned lips and cheeks death-white
1664,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Will lie amid the pool of light,"
1665,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Until, grown faint with thirst of her,"
1666,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,He shall bow down his face and sink
1667,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,Breathless beneath the eddying brink.
1668,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,
1669,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"Then a swift music will begin,"
1670,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"And as the brazen doors shut slow,"
1671,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"There will be hurrying to and fro,"
1672,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,"And lights and calls and silver din,"
1673,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,While through the star-freaked swirl of air
1674,THE GOLDEN JOURNEY,The god's sweet cruel eyes will stare.

1695,HEART'S WILD-FLOWER,"When meadow-pipings break and blend to a key of autumn woe,"

1904,THE RIDE BACK,"And of a road, much like the road his soul"

1907,THE RIDE BACK,
1908,THE RIDE BACK,
1909,THE RIDE BACK,"His limbs were heavy from the fight,"
1910,THE RIDE BACK,His mail was dark with dust and blood;
1911,THE RIDE BACK,"On his good horse they bound him tight,"
1912,THE RIDE BACK,And on his breast they bound the rood
1913,THE RIDE BACK,To help him in the ride that night.
1914,THE RIDE BACK,
1915,THE RIDE BACK,"When he crashed through the wood's wet rim,"
1916,THE RIDE BACK,About the dabbled reeds a breeze
1917,THE RIDE BACK,Went moaning broken words and dim;
1918,THE RIDE BACK,The haggard shapes of twilight trees
1919,THE RIDE BACK,Caught with their scrawny hands at him.
1920,THE RIDE BACK,
1921,THE RIDE BACK,Between the doubtful aisles of day
1922,THE RIDE BACK,Strange folk and lamentable stood
1923,THE RIDE BACK,"To maze and beckon him astray,"
1924,THE RIDE BACK,But through the grey wrath of the wood
1925,THE RIDE BACK,He held right on his bitter way.
1926,THE RIDE BACK,
1927,THE RIDE BACK,"When he came where the trees were thin,"
1928,THE RIDE BACK,The moon sat waiting there to see;
1929,THE RIDE BACK,"On her worn palm she laid her chin,"
1930,THE RIDE BACK,And laughed awhile in sober glee
1931,THE RIDE BACK,To think how strong this knight had been.
1932,THE RIDE BACK,
1933,THE RIDE BACK,"When he rode past the pallid lake,"
1934,THE RIDE BACK,The withered yellow stems of flags
1935,THE RIDE BACK,Stood breast-high for his horse to break;
1936,THE RIDE BACK,Lewd as the palsied lips of hags
1937,THE RIDE BACK,The petals in the moon did shake.
1938,THE RIDE BACK,
1939,THE RIDE BACK,"When he came by the mountain wall,"
1940,THE RIDE BACK,The snow upon the heights looked down
1941,THE RIDE BACK,"And said, ""The sight is pitiful."

1944,THE RIDE BACK,

1950,THE RIDE BACK,
1951,THE RIDE BACK,Just when the ache in breast and brain
1952,THE RIDE BACK,And the frost smiting at his face
1953,THE RIDE BACK,"Had sealed his spirit up with pain,"
1954,THE RIDE BACK,"He came out in a better place,"
1955,THE RIDE BACK,And morning lay across the plain.
1956,THE RIDE BACK,
1957,THE RIDE BACK,He saw the wet snails crawl and cling
1958,THE RIDE BACK,"On fern-stalks where the rime had run,"
1959,THE RIDE BACK,"The careless birds went wing and wing,"
1960,THE RIDE BACK,And in the low smile of the sun
1961,THE RIDE BACK,Life seemed almost a pleasant thing.
1962,THE RIDE BACK,
1963,THE RIDE BACK,Right on the panting charger swung
1964,THE RIDE BACK,Through the bright depths of quiet grass;
1965,THE RIDE BACK,"The knight's lips moved as if they sung,"
1966,THE RIDE BACK,And through the peace there came to pass
1967,THE RIDE BACK,The flattery of lute and tongue.
1968,THE RIDE BACK,
1969,THE RIDE BACK,From the mid-flowering of the mead
1970,THE RIDE BACK,"There swelled a sob of minstrelsy,"

1972,THE RIDE BACK,"And plaintive lips of maids thereby,"
1973,THE RIDE BACK,And songs blown out like thistle seed.
1974,THE RIDE BACK,
1975,THE RIDE BACK,"Forth from her maidens came the bride,"
1976,THE RIDE BACK,And as his loosened rein fell slack

2291,BUONCONTE,"Though still I call and call,"
2292,BUONCONTE,She does not heed at all.

2294,BUONCONTE,And if aright your words I read
2295,BUONCONTE,"At Dante's passing, he you wed"

2320,LA PIA,"Maketh forever unafraid,"
2321,LA PIA,Though life with death unite
2322,LA PIA,"That spirit to affright,--"
2323,LA PIA,

2341,LA PIA,With the Roman spirit pure
2342,LA PIA,"And the grave troubadour,"
2343,LA PIA,

2530,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,That ringed Him where He sat
2531,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate

2565,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,The careless season yields
2566,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Hither-side the flood o' the year and yonder of the neap;
2567,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Then thank you, thanks again, and twenty light good-byes.--"

2575,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,And prey to troubled thought

2577,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,These foolish shifts and slight;
2578,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Only to shield me from the afflicting sense
2579,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Of some waste influence
2580,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Which from this morning face and lustrous hair
2581,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair.

2584,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Your coming had not so unsealed and poured
2585,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,The dusty amphoras where I had stored
2586,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,The drippings of the winepress of my days.
2587,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"I think these eyes foresee,"
2588,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Now in their unawakened virgin time,"
2589,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Their mother's pride in me,"
2590,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"And dream even now, unconsciously,"
2591,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Upon each soaring peak and sky-hung lea
2592,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,You pictured I should climb.

2599,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Thwarted and bright and wild,"
2600,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"As heralding a sin-defiled,"

2602,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Who yet should be a trump of mighty call
2603,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Blown in the gates of evil kings
2604,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,To make them fall;

2607,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,To beat away the clang of hellish wings;
2608,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Who yet should be a lyre

2614,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,And set upon the shelf
2615,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,In sullen pride
2616,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,The Vineyard-master's tasting to abide--
2617,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,O mother mine!

2619,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Of him you used to praise?
2620,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Emptied and overthrown
2621,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,The jars lie strown.
2622,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"These, for their flavor duly nursed,"
2623,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed;
2624,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"These, I thought honied to the very seal,"
2625,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Dry, dry,--a little acid meal,"
2626,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"A pinch of mouldy dust,"
2627,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must;
2628,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"These, rude to look upon,"
2629,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"But flasking up the liquor dearest won,"
2630,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Through sacred hours and hard,"
2631,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"With watching and with wrestlings and with grief,"
2632,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Even of these, of these in chief,"
2633,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"The stale breath sickens, reeking from the shard."
2634,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Nothing is left. Ay, how much less than naught!"
2635,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,What shall be said or thought
2636,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Of the slack hours and waste imaginings,"
2637,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"The cynic rending of the wings,"
2638,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Known to that froward, that unreckoning heart"

2659,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"These eyes afflict me, cleanse me, keep me yet."
2660,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,Brave eyes and true!
2661,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"See how the shriveled heart, that long has lain"
2662,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Dead to delight and pain,"
2663,THE DAGUERREOTYPE,"Stirs, and begins again"
