590,PROLOGUE,_There is a poetry that speaks
591,PROLOGUE,"Through common things: the grasshopper,"
592,PROLOGUE,"That in the hot weeds creaks and creaks,"
593,PROLOGUE,Says all of summer to my ear:
594,PROLOGUE,And in the cricket’s cry I hear
595,PROLOGUE,"The fireside speak, and feel the frost"
596,PROLOGUE,Work mysteries of silver near
597,PROLOGUE,"On country casements, while, deep lost"
598,PROLOGUE,"In snow, the gatepost seems a sheeted ghost._"
599,PROLOGUE,
600,PROLOGUE,_And other things give rare delight:
601,PROLOGUE,"The guttural harps the green-frogs tune,"
602,PROLOGUE,"Those minstrels of the falling night,"
603,PROLOGUE,That hail the sickle of the moon
604,PROLOGUE,From grassy pools that glass her lune:
605,PROLOGUE,"Or,--all of August in its loud"
606,PROLOGUE,"Dry cry,--the locust’s call at noon,"
607,PROLOGUE,"That emphasizes heat, no cloud"
608,PROLOGUE,Of lazy white makes less with its cool shroud._
609,PROLOGUE,
610,PROLOGUE,"_The rain,--whose cloud dark-lids the moon,"
611,PROLOGUE,"That great white eyeball of the night,--"
612,PROLOGUE,Makes music for me; to its tune
613,PROLOGUE,"I hear the flowers unfolding white,"
614,PROLOGUE,"The mushroom growing, and the slight"
615,PROLOGUE,Green sound of grass that dances near;
616,PROLOGUE,The melon ripening with delight;
617,PROLOGUE,"And in the orchard, soft and clear,"
618,PROLOGUE,The apple redly rounding out its sphere._
619,PROLOGUE,
620,PROLOGUE,"_The grigs make music as of old,"
621,PROLOGUE,To which the fairies whirl and shine
622,PROLOGUE,"Within the moonlight’s prodigal gold,"
623,PROLOGUE,On woodways wild with many a vine:
624,PROLOGUE,When all the wilderness with wine
625,PROLOGUE,"Of stars is drunk, I hear it say--"
626,PROLOGUE,“Is God restricted to confine
627,PROLOGUE,"His wonders only to the day,"
628,PROLOGUE,That yields the abstract tangible to clay?”_
629,PROLOGUE,
630,PROLOGUE,"_And to my ear the wind of Morn,--"
631,PROLOGUE,When on her rubric forehead far
632,PROLOGUE,"One star burns big,--lifts a vast horn"
633,PROLOGUE,Of wonder where all murmurs are:
634,PROLOGUE,"In which I hear the waters war,"
635,PROLOGUE,"The torrent and the blue abyss,"
636,PROLOGUE,"And pines,--that terrace bar on bar"
637,PROLOGUE,"The mountain side,--like lovers kiss,"
638,PROLOGUE,And whisper words where all of grandeur is._
639,PROLOGUE,
640,PROLOGUE,"_The jutting crags,--dark, iron-veined"
641,PROLOGUE,"With ore,--the peaks, where eagles scream,"
642,PROLOGUE,"That pour their cataracts, rainbow-stained,"
643,PROLOGUE,"Like hair, in many a mountain stream,"
644,PROLOGUE,Can lift my soul beyond the dream
645,PROLOGUE,Of all religions; make me scan

659,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"Green a roof of cool perfume,"
660,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Have you felt an awe imperious
661,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"As when, in a church, mysterious"
662,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Windows paint with God the gloom?
663,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,
664,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"In the shadow of the beeches,"
665,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Where the rock-ledged waters flow;
666,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Where the sun’s slant splendor bleaches
667,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"Every wave to foaming snow,"
668,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Have you felt a music solemn
669,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,As when minster arch and column
670,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Echo organ worship low?
671,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,
672,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"In the shadow of the beeches,"
673,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Where the light and shade are blent;
674,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"Where the forest-bird beseeches,"
675,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"And the breeze is brimmed with scent,--"
676,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Is it joy or melancholy
677,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"That o’erwhelms us partly, wholly,"
678,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,To our spirit’s betterment?
679,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,
680,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,In the shadow of the beeches
681,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Lay me where no eye perceives;
682,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"Where,--like some great arm that reaches"
683,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"Gently as a love that grieves,--"
684,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,One gnarled root may clasp me kindly
685,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,"While the long years, working blindly,"
686,IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES,Slowly change my dust to leaves.

694,A FALLEN BEECH,Nevermore at doorways that are barken
695,A FALLEN BEECH,Shall the madcap wind knock and the moonlight;
696,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nor the circle which thou once didst darken,"
697,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shine with footsteps of the neighboring moonlight,"
698,A FALLEN BEECH,Visitors for whom thou oft didst hearken.
699,A FALLEN BEECH,
700,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nevermore, gallooned with cloudy laces,"
701,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shall the morning, like a fair freebooter,"
702,A FALLEN BEECH,Make thy leaves his richest treasure-places;
703,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nor the sunset, like a royal suitor,"
704,A FALLEN BEECH,Clothe thy limbs with his imperial graces.
705,A FALLEN BEECH,
706,A FALLEN BEECH,"And no more, between the savage wonder"
707,A FALLEN BEECH,"Of the sunset and the moon’s up-coming,"
708,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shall the storm, with boisterous hoof-beats, under"
709,A FALLEN BEECH,"Thy dark roof dance, Faun-like, to the humming"
710,A FALLEN BEECH,Of the Pan-pipes of the rain and thunder.
711,A FALLEN BEECH,
712,A FALLEN BEECH,"Oft the Satyr-spirit, beauty-drunken,"
713,A FALLEN BEECH,Of the Spring called; and the music measure
714,A FALLEN BEECH,Of thy sap made answer; and thy sunken
715,A FALLEN BEECH,"Veins grew vehement with youth, whose pressure"
716,A FALLEN BEECH,"Swelled thy gnarly muscles, winter-shrunken."
717,A FALLEN BEECH,
718,A FALLEN BEECH,"And the germs, deep down in darkness rooted,"
719,A FALLEN BEECH,"Bubbled green from all thy million oilets,"
720,A FALLEN BEECH,"Where the spirits, rain and sunbeam suited,"
721,A FALLEN BEECH,"Of the April made their whispering toilets,"
722,A FALLEN BEECH,Or within thy stately shadow footed.
723,A FALLEN BEECH,
724,A FALLEN BEECH,Oft the hours of blonde Summer tinkled
725,A FALLEN BEECH,"At the windows of thy twigs, and found thee"
726,A FALLEN BEECH,"Bird-blithe; or, with shapely bodies, twinkled"
727,A FALLEN BEECH,"Lissom feet of naked flowers around thee,"
728,A FALLEN BEECH,Where thy mats of moss lay sunbeam-sprinkled.
729,A FALLEN BEECH,
730,A FALLEN BEECH,And the Autumn with his gypsy-coated
731,A FALLEN BEECH,"Troop of days beneath thy branches rested,"
732,A FALLEN BEECH,Swarthy-faced and dark of eye; and throated
733,A FALLEN BEECH,Songs of hunting; or with red hand tested
734,A FALLEN BEECH,Every nut-burr that above him floated.
735,A FALLEN BEECH,
736,A FALLEN BEECH,"Then the Winter, barren-browed, but rich in"
737,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shaggy followers of frost and freezing,"
738,A FALLEN BEECH,"Made the floor of thy broad boughs his kitchen,"
739,A FALLEN BEECH,"Trapper-like, to camp in; grimly easing"
740,A FALLEN BEECH,Limbs snow-furred and moccasined with lichen.
741,A FALLEN BEECH,
742,A FALLEN BEECH,"Now, alas! no more do these invest thee"
743,A FALLEN BEECH,With the dignity of whilom gladness!
744,A FALLEN BEECH,They--unto whose hearts thou once confessed thee
745,A FALLEN BEECH,Of thy dreams--now know thee not! and sadness
746,A FALLEN BEECH,"Sits beside thee where, forgot, dost rest thee."

779,A COIGNE OF THE FOREST,The record of its loveliness with notes.
780,A COIGNE OF THE FOREST,"At night the moon stoops over it to rest,"
781,A COIGNE OF THE FOREST,"And unreluctant stars, in whose faint shine"

801,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"Pathetic with their fallen finery,--"
802,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,And whispering through its cob-webbed crevices

804,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,Undreamed of things that happened long ago.
805,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,
806,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"Here in gray afternoons I love to sit,"
807,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,And hear the running rain along the roof;
808,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,The creak and crack of noises that are born
809,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,Of silence or mysterious agencies;
810,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,The fitful footfalls of the wind adown
811,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"Grand, winding stairways, massy banistered;"
812,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,A clapping door and then a sudden hush
813,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"As if the old house held its breath to see,--"
814,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"Invisible to me,--a presence pass,"
815,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,That brings a pleasant terror stiffening through
816,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,The tingling veins and staring from the eyes.
817,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,Then comes the rain again along the roof;
818,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,And in rain-rotted room and rain-stained hall
819,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,The drip and whisper of the wind and rain
820,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,Seem viewless footsteps of the sometime lords
821,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,And mistresses who lived here in the past.
822,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,And could the state material but assume
823,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"A state clairvoyant, then the dream-drugged eyes,"
824,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"Perhaps, might see, from room to dusty room,"
825,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"The ghosts of stately gentlemen glide by,"
826,A HOUSE IN THE HILLS,"And glimmering ladies, all beruffled, trail"

845,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Spring, winter, and fall."
846,FROM THE ARABIC.,
847,FROM THE ARABIC.,When it tells to the waiting crocus
848,FROM THE ARABIC.,Its beak to show;
849,FROM THE ARABIC.,And hangs on the wayside locust
850,FROM THE ARABIC.,Bloom-bunches of snow.
851,FROM THE ARABIC.,
852,FROM THE ARABIC.,When it comes like a balmy blessing
853,FROM THE ARABIC.,"From the musky wood,"
854,FROM THE ARABIC.,The half-grown roses caressing
855,FROM THE ARABIC.,Till their cheeks burn blood.
856,FROM THE ARABIC.,

868,FROM THE ARABIC.,"In the hollow tree,"
869,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Sobs, dolorous, cold, and drowsy,"
870,FROM THE ARABIC.,Its shuddering melody.
871,FROM THE ARABIC.,
872,FROM THE ARABIC.,Then I love to sit in December
873,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Where the big hearth sings,"
874,FROM THE ARABIC.,"And, dreaming, forget and remember"

876,FROM THE ARABIC.,
877,FROM THE ARABIC.,"And the wind--I hear how it strangles,"
878,FROM THE ARABIC.,And wails and sighs
879,FROM THE ARABIC.,"On the roof’s sharp, shivering angles"
880,FROM THE ARABIC.,That front the skies.
881,FROM THE ARABIC.,
882,FROM THE ARABIC.,How it shouts and romps and tumbles
883,FROM THE ARABIC.,In attics o’erhead;
884,FROM THE ARABIC.,"In the great-throated chimney rumbles,"
885,FROM THE ARABIC.,Then all at once falls dead;
886,FROM THE ARABIC.,
887,FROM THE ARABIC.,Then comes like the footsteps stealing
888,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Of a child on the stair,"
889,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Or a bent, old gentleman feeling"
890,FROM THE ARABIC.,His slippered way with care.
891,FROM THE ARABIC.,
892,FROM THE ARABIC.,And my soul grows anxious-hearted
893,FROM THE ARABIC.,For those once dear--
894,FROM THE ARABIC.,"The long-lost loves, departed,"
895,FROM THE ARABIC.,In the wind draw near.
896,FROM THE ARABIC.,
897,FROM THE ARABIC.,And I seem to see their faces--
898,FROM THE ARABIC.,Not one estranged--
899,FROM THE ARABIC.,In their old accustomed places
900,FROM THE ARABIC.,Round the wide hearth ranged.
901,FROM THE ARABIC.,
902,FROM THE ARABIC.,"And the wind, that waits and poises"
903,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Where the shadows sway,"
904,FROM THE ARABIC.,Seems their visionary voices
905,FROM THE ARABIC.,Calling me far away.
906,FROM THE ARABIC.,
907,FROM THE ARABIC.,Then I wake in tears and hear it
908,FROM THE ARABIC.,"Wailing outside my door,--"
909,FROM THE ARABIC.,Or is it some wandering spirit

1391,II,"And, tinkling in the clover dells,"
1392,II,The twilight sound of cattle-bells.
1393,II,And where the marsh in reed and grass
1394,II,"Burns, angry as a shattered glass,"
1395,II,"The flies blur sudden gold, and shine"
1396,II,Like drops of amber-scattered wine
1397,II,"Spun high by reeling Bacchanals,"
1398,II,When Bacchus wreathes his curling hair
1399,II,"With vine-leaves, and from every lair"
1400,II,His worshippers around him calls.
1401,II,"They come, they come, a happy throng,"
1402,II,The berriers with lilt and song;
1403,II,Their pails brimmed black to tin-bright eaves
1404,II,"With luscious fruit, kept cool with leaves"
1405,II,Of aromatic sassafras;
1406,II,"’Twixt which a berry often slips,"

1415,III,Below the drowsy belts of pines
1416,III,The rock-ledged river leaps and shines;
1417,III,And over rainless hill and dell
1418,III,Is blown the harvest’s sultry smell:
1419,III,"While, in the fields, one sees and hears"
1420,III,"The brawny-throated harvesters,--"
1421,III,"Their red brows beaded with the heat,--"
1422,III,By twos and threes among the wheat
1423,III,Flash their hot scythes; behind them press
1424,III,The binders--men and maids who sing
1425,III,Like some mad troop of piping Pan;--
1426,III,"While all the hillsides, echoing, ring"
1427,III,Such sounds of Ariel airiness
1428,III,As haunted freckled Caliban.
1429,III,
1430,III,“O ho! O ho! ’tis noon I say.
1431,III,The roses blow.
1432,III,"Away, away, above the hay,"
1433,III,To the song o’ the bees the roses sway;
1434,III,"The love-lays that they hum all day,"
1435,III,So low! so low!
1436,III,The roses’ Minnesingers they.”
1437,III,
1438,III,Up velvet lawns of lilac skies
1439,III,The tawny moon begins to rise
1440,III,"Behind low, blue-black hills of trees,--"
1441,III,"As rises up, in siren seas,"
1442,III,"To rock in purple deeps, hip-hid,"
1443,III,A virgin-bosomed Oceanid.--
1444,III,"Gaunt shadows crouch by tree and scaur,"
1445,III,Dusk’s shaggy Satyrs waiting for
1446,III,"The Nymphs of moon, the Dryads white,"
1447,III,"Who take with loveliness the night,"
1448,III,And glorify it with their love.
1449,III,"The sweet, far notes I hear, I hear,"
1450,III,Beyond dim pines and mellow ways;
1451,III,"The song of some fair harvester,"
1452,III,"The lovely Limnad of the grove,"
1453,III,Whose singing charms me while it slays.
1454,III,
1455,III,“O deep! O deep! the earth and air
1456,III,Are sunk in sleep.
1457,III,Adieu to care! Now everywhere
1458,III,Is rest; and by the old oak there
1459,III,The maiden with the nut-brown hair

1470,IV,And near them pears of rusty brown
1471,IV,"Rolled bruised; and peaches, pink with down,"
1472,IV,And furry as the ears of Pan;
1473,IV,"Or, like Diana’s cheeks, a tan"
1474,IV,Beneath which burnt a tender fire;
1475,IV,Or wan as Psyche’s with desire.
1476,IV,"And down the orchard vistas,--young,"
1477,IV,"A hickory basket by him swung,"
1478,IV,A hat of straw against the sun
1479,IV,"Drawn shadowy o’er his face,--he strode;"
1480,IV,"As if he looked to find some one,"
1481,IV,His eyes searched every bend of road.
1482,IV,"Before him, like a living burr,"
1483,IV,Rattled the noisy grasshopper.
1484,IV,And where the cows’ melodious bells
1485,IV,"Trailed music up and down the dells,"
1486,IV,"Beside the spring, that o’er the ground"
1487,IV,"Went whimpering like a fretful hound,"
1488,IV,"He saw her waiting, fair and slim,"
1489,IV,"Her pail forgotten there, for him."
1490,IV,Yellow as sunset skies and pale
1491,IV,As fairy clouds that stay or sail
1492,IV,"Through azure vaults of summer, blue"
1493,IV,"As summer heavens, the wildflowers grew;"
1494,IV,And blossoms on which spurts of light
1495,IV,Fell laughing--like the lips one might
1496,IV,"Feign once were Hebe’s, or a girl’s"
1497,IV,That laughter lights with rows of pearls.
1498,IV,"Long ferns, in murmuring masses heaped;"
1499,IV,"And mosses moist, in beryl steeped"
1500,IV,And musk aromas of the wood
1501,IV,And silence of the solitude:
1502,IV,And everything that near her blew
1503,IV,The spring had showered thick with dew.--
1504,IV,"Across the rambling fence she leaned,"
1505,IV,"Her fresh, round arms all white and bare;"
1506,IV,"Her artless beauty, bonnet-screened,"
1507,IV,Simplicity from feet to hair.
1508,IV,A wood-thrush gurgled in a vine--
1509,IV,"Ah! ’tis his step, ’tis he she hears;"
1510,IV,The wild-rose smelt like some rare wine--
1511,IV,"He comes, ah, yes! ’tis he who nears."
1512,IV,And her brown eyes and happy face
1513,IV,Said welcome. And with rustic grace
1514,IV,He leant beside her; and they had
1515,IV,Some talk with youthful laughter glad:
1516,IV,I know not what: I know but this--
1517,IV,Its final period was a kiss.

1874,AUTUMN,"Her cheeks a hectic flush, more fair than Spring,"
1875,AUTUMN,As if on her the scarlet copse had smiled:
1876,AUTUMN,"Or I have seen her sitting, dark and tall,--"
1877,AUTUMN,"Her gentle eyes with foolish weeping dim,--"
1878,AUTUMN,Beneath a twisted oak from whose red leaves
1879,AUTUMN,She wound great drowsy wreaths and let them fall;
1880,AUTUMN,"The west-wind in her hair, that made it swim"
1881,AUTUMN,"Far out behind, brown as the rustling sheaves."
1882,AUTUMN,
1883,AUTUMN,Or in the hill-lands I have often seen
1884,AUTUMN,The marvel of her passage; glimpses faint
1885,AUTUMN,"Of glimmering woods that glanced the hills between,"
1886,AUTUMN,"Like Indian faces, fierce with forest paint."
1887,AUTUMN,"Or I have met her ’twixt two beechen hills,"
1888,AUTUMN,"Within a dingled valley near a fall,"
1889,AUTUMN,Held in her nut-brown hand one cardinal flower;
1890,AUTUMN,Or wading dimly where the leaf-dammed rills
1891,AUTUMN,"Went babbling through the wildwood’s arrased hall,"
1892,AUTUMN,Where burned the beech and maples glared their power.
1893,AUTUMN,
1894,AUTUMN,"Or I have met her by a ruined mill,"
1895,AUTUMN,"Where trailed the crimson creeper, serpentine,"
1896,AUTUMN,"On fallen leaves that stirred and rustled, chill,"
1897,AUTUMN,And watched her swinging in the wildgrapevine.
1898,AUTUMN,"While Beauty, sad among the vales and mountains,"
1899,AUTUMN,"More sad than death, or all that death can teach,"
1900,AUTUMN,"Dreamed of decay and stretched appealing arms,"
1901,AUTUMN,Where splashed the murmur of the forest’s fountains:
1902,AUTUMN,"With all her loveliness did she beseech,"
1903,AUTUMN,And all the sorrow of her wildwood charms.
1904,AUTUMN,
1905,AUTUMN,"Once only in a hollow, girt with trees,"
1906,AUTUMN,"A-dream amid wild asters filled with rain,"
1907,AUTUMN,"I glimpsed her cheeks, red-berried by the breeze,"
1908,AUTUMN,In her dark eyes the night’s sidereal stain.
1909,AUTUMN,"And once upon an orchard’s tangled path,"
1910,AUTUMN,"Where all the goldenrod had turned to brown,"
1911,AUTUMN,"Where russets rolled and leaves lay sweet of breath,"
1912,AUTUMN,I did behold her ’mid her aftermath
1913,AUTUMN,"Of blossoms standing, in her gypsy gown,"
1914,AUTUMN,Within her gaze the dreams of life and death.

1957,ALONG THE OHIO,The broad Ohio glitters to the stars;

2048,THE MILL-WATER,
2049,THE MILL-WATER,They climb through oozy weeds and moss;
2050,THE MILL-WATER,They swarm its rotting sides and toss

2052,THE MILL-WATER,Or hang them in the tangled sedge.

2054,THE MILL-WATER,The boat is loosed. The moon is pale.
2055,THE MILL-WATER,Around the dam they slowly sail.

2073,THE DREAM,"Of some deep, tropic day; and yet the moon"
2074,THE DREAM,"Hung, round and bright with golden alchemy,"
2075,THE DREAM,High in a heaven sapphire as the sea.
2076,THE DREAM,"Long, lawny lengths of perishable cloud"
2077,THE DREAM,"Templed the west, o’er rolling forests bowed;"
2078,THE DREAM,"Clouds raining colors, gold and violet,"
2079,THE DREAM,"That, opening, seemed from inner worlds to let"
2080,THE DREAM,Down hints of Parian beauty and lost charms
2081,THE DREAM,"Of old romance, peopled with fairy forms."
2082,THE DREAM,"And all about me fruited orchards grew,"
2083,THE DREAM,"Pear, quince, and peach, and plums of dusty blue;"
2084,THE DREAM,"Rose-apricots, and apples streaked with fire,"
2085,THE DREAM,"Kissed into ripeness by some sun’s desire,"
2086,THE DREAM,"And big with juice. And on far, fading hills,"
2087,THE DREAM,Down which it seemed a hundred torrent rills
2088,THE DREAM,"Flashed silent silver, vines and vines and vines"
2089,THE DREAM,"Terraced the world with vintage, cooling wines,"
2090,THE DREAM,"Pleasant and fragrant as the heart of June,"
2091,THE DREAM,Their delicate tang drawn from the wine-white moon.
2092,THE DREAM,
2093,THE DREAM,And from the clouds o’er this sweet world there dripped
2094,THE DREAM,"An odorous music, strange and feverish-lipped,"
2095,THE DREAM,That swung and swooned and panted as with sighs;
2096,THE DREAM,Investing at each throb the air with eyes
2097,THE DREAM,"And forms of sensuous spirits, limpid white,"
2098,THE DREAM,Clad on with raiment as of starry night;
2099,THE DREAM,"Fair, frail embodiments of melody,"
2100,THE DREAM,From out whose hearts of crystal one could see
2101,THE DREAM,The music stream like light through delicate hands
2102,THE DREAM,Hollowing a lamp. And as on sounding sands
2103,THE DREAM,"The ocean murmur haunts the rosy shells,--"
2104,THE DREAM,"Within whose convolutions beauty dwells,--"
2105,THE DREAM,My soul became a harp of vibrant love
2106,THE DREAM,Reëchoing all the harmony above.

2117,SPRING TWILIGHT,Blooming with almond-rose.
2118,SPRING TWILIGHT,
2119,SPRING TWILIGHT,"The sun set late; and wafts of wind beat down,"
2120,SPRING TWILIGHT,And cuffed the blossoms from the blossoming quince;

2122,SPRING TWILIGHT,And made the clover wince.
2123,SPRING TWILIGHT,

2132,SPRING TWILIGHT,Burned in fair deeps of air.

2301,THE FARMSTEAD,Parallels of scarlet glare.
2302,THE FARMSTEAD,
2303,THE FARMSTEAD,"And the moon-hued primrose cool,"
2304,THE FARMSTEAD,Satin-soft and redolent;
2305,THE FARMSTEAD,"Honeysuckles beautiful,"
2306,THE FARMSTEAD,Filling all the air with scent;

2358,THE FARMSTEAD,"Borne from out the golden dusk,--"
2359,THE FARMSTEAD,"Gold with gold of daffodils,--"
2360,THE FARMSTEAD,Thrilled into the garden’s musk

2376,THE FARMSTEAD,"Firefly,--its taper lit"
2377,THE FARMSTEAD,"In the honey-scented gloam,"
2378,THE FARMSTEAD,Dashing down the dusk with it
2379,THE FARMSTEAD,Like an instant-flaming foam.
2380,THE FARMSTEAD,
2381,THE FARMSTEAD,"And we heard the calling, calling,"
2382,THE FARMSTEAD,Of the brown owl in the brake;
2383,THE FARMSTEAD,"Where the trumpet-vine hung, crawling"
2384,THE FARMSTEAD,"Down the ledge, into the lake"
2385,THE FARMSTEAD,Heard the sighing streamlet falling.
2386,THE FARMSTEAD,
2387,THE FARMSTEAD,Then we wandered to the creek
2388,THE FARMSTEAD,"Where the water-lilies, growing"
2389,THE FARMSTEAD,"Thick as stars, lay white and weak;"
2390,THE FARMSTEAD,Or against the brooklet’s flowing
2391,THE FARMSTEAD,Stooped and bathed a bashful cheek.
2392,THE FARMSTEAD,
2393,THE FARMSTEAD,"And the moonlight, rippling golden,"
2394,THE FARMSTEAD,Fell in virgin aureoles
2395,THE FARMSTEAD,"On their bosoms, half-unfolden,"
2396,THE FARMSTEAD,"Where, it seemed, the fairies’ souls"

2399,THE FARMSTEAD,"Lying sleeping, pearly-tented,"
2400,THE FARMSTEAD,"Baby-cribbed within each bud,"
2401,THE FARMSTEAD,"While the night-wind, pinewood-scented,"
2402,THE FARMSTEAD,"Swooning over field and flood,"
2403,THE FARMSTEAD,Rocked them on the waters dented.
2404,THE FARMSTEAD,
2405,THE FARMSTEAD,"Then the low, melodious bell"
2406,THE FARMSTEAD,"Of a sleeping heifer tinkled,"
2407,THE FARMSTEAD,"In some berry-briered dell,"

2409,THE FARMSTEAD,With the cud that made it swell.
2410,THE FARMSTEAD,
2411,THE FARMSTEAD,"And, returning home, we heard,"
2412,THE FARMSTEAD,"In a beech-tree at the gate,"
2413,THE FARMSTEAD,"Some brown, dream-behaunted bird,"
2414,THE FARMSTEAD,"Singing of its absent mate,"

2424,THE FARMSTEAD,And my frosty memory

2429,THE FARMSTEAD,"Yes, I loved her, and have grown"
2430,THE FARMSTEAD,"Melancholy in that love,"
2431,THE FARMSTEAD,And the memory alone
2432,THE FARMSTEAD,Of her loveliness whereof
2433,THE FARMSTEAD,She did sanctify each stone.
2434,THE FARMSTEAD,
2435,THE FARMSTEAD,"And where’er her flowers swing,"

3099,THE OLD FARM,
3100,THE OLD FARM,"Seckel, blackheart, palpitant,"
3101,THE OLD FARM,Rained their bleaching strays; and white

3147,THE OLD FARM,

3149,THE OLD FARM,On its westward windows dashes
3150,THE OLD FARM,Primrose or pomegranate glow?

3152,THE OLD FARM,"Faint, first stars the heavens sow?"
3153,THE OLD FARM,
3154,THE OLD FARM,"Sleeps it still among its roses,"
3155,THE OLD FARM,Yellow roses? while the choir
3156,THE OLD FARM,Of the lonesome insects dozes?

3212,IV,"Even the wind and rain,"
3213,IV,"And frogs and insects, singing soon and late,"
3214,IV,"Thy sympathies inspire, thy heart’s refrain,"

3551,AMONG THE KNOBS,"In lilacs and old roses hid,--"
3552,AMONG THE KNOBS,With picket-fence looked down.
3553,AMONG THE KNOBS,
3554,AMONG THE KNOBS,O’er ruins now the roses guard;
3555,AMONG THE KNOBS,The plum and seckel-pear
3556,AMONG THE KNOBS,And apricot rot on the sward
3557,AMONG THE KNOBS,Their wasted ripeness there.
3558,AMONG THE KNOBS,
3559,AMONG THE KNOBS,Again when huckleberries blow
3560,AMONG THE KNOBS,Their waxen bells I’ll tread
3561,AMONG THE KNOBS,That dear accustomed way; and go
3562,AMONG THE KNOBS,Adown that orchard; led
3563,AMONG THE KNOBS,
3564,AMONG THE KNOBS,"To that avoided spot, which seems"
3565,AMONG THE KNOBS,The haunt of vanished springs;
3566,AMONG THE KNOBS,Lost as the hills in drowsy dreams

3573,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3574,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3575,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Here on this jutting headland, where the trees"
3576,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Spread a dusk carpet for the sun to cast
3577,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And count his golden guineas on, we’ll rest."
3578,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Behold th’ Ohio Falls: see how it seethes!
3579,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Though hardly heard from this high, wooded point,"
3580,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Yet how it still confuses tongue and ear
3581,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,With its subdued and low monotonous roar!
3582,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Not as it did, however, when we stood"
3583,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And marked it from the spanning of the bridge
3584,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Rushing beneath, impetuous as a herd,--"
3585,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A tameless herd, with manes of flying spray,--"
3586,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Between the pillars towering above.
3587,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,No more does it confound us and confuse;
3588,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Its clamor here is softened to a sound,"
3589,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Incessant and subdued, like that which haunts"
3590,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The groves of spring, when, like some dim surprise,"
3591,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A wind, precursor of the rain, rides down"
3592,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,From a gray cloud and sets the leafy tongues
3593,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Cool-gossiping of the approaching shower.
3594,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,There runs the dam; and where its dark line cuts
3595,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The river’s sheen, already you may see"
3596,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The ripples glancing to the summer sun,"
3597,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,As if a host had couched a thousand spears
3598,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And tossed a thousand plumes of fleecy foam,"
3599,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"In answer to the challenge of the Falls,"
3600,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Blown from his limestone battlements, and cried"
3601,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,From his wave-builded city’s roaring walls.
3602,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And there, you see, the waves like champions charge;"
3603,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Crowding, wild form on form, their foam-hoofs beat"
3604,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,The ragged rocks that roll them on their way:
3605,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Billowing they come; knight-like, to ringing lists,"
3606,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"With shout on shout, tossing a thousand plumes,"
3607,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,A thousand spears in sparkling tournament;
3608,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Lifting, opposing each, a silvery shield"
3609,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Or shining pennon, now that sinks or soars,"
3610,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And many a glittering sword of twinkling foam,"
3611,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And many a helmet, shattered in flakes of froth,"
3612,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"That, to the trumpeting wind, hisses away:"
3613,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"While, o’er it all, swell out the rush and roar"
3614,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Of onset, as of battle borne afar.--"
3615,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"On, on they come, a beautiful, mad troop!"
3616,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"On, on, along the sandy banks that fling"
3617,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Red pebble-freckled arms far out to stay
3618,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Their ruinous rush, the knightly strife of waves,"
3619,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Warring, and winding wild their watery horns."
3620,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3621,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Look, where a thousand oily eddies whirl,"
3622,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And turn and turn like wheels of liquid steel
3623,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Below this headland! ’Tis a place that none
3624,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Has bottomed yet with sounding lead and line.
3625,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Like some huge kraken, coiling vast its length,"
3626,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The Eddy sleeps; and, bending from the shores,"
3627,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The spotted sycamores have gazed and gazed,"
3628,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Watching its slumber as gray giants might
3629,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A dragon in the hollow of gaunt hills,"
3630,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Its serpent bulk wound round some magic hoard.
3631,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"So long they’ve watched, their ancient backs have grown"
3632,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Humped, gnarled, and bent, but still they gaze and gaze,"
3633,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Leaning above; and from the glassy waves
3634,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Their images stare back their wonderment.
3635,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Haply they see the guardian Genius lie
3636,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,At the dark bottom in an oozy cave
3637,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Of coral; webbed, recumbent on his mace"
3638,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Of mineral; his locks of dripping green
3639,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Circling a crown of ore; his fishy eyes
3640,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Dull with the aqueous dullness of his realms.
3641,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,But when the storm’s abroad and whips the waves
3642,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"With stinging lashes of the myriad rain,"
3643,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Or scars with thunder some ancestral oak,"
3644,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Sire of a forest, then he wakes in wrath,"
3645,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And on the dark foundation of the stream
3646,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Rises, a monarch, crowned with iron crown,"
3647,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"And hurls his challenge upward at the storm,"
3648,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And rages through the waters; heaves and breaks
3649,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Through the wild waves, whose round and murky bulks,"
3650,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Ribbed white with foam, wallow their monster way,"
3651,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Like giant herds, along yon edge of rock"
3652,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,O’erstrewn with petrifactions of far time;
3653,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Mollusk and trilobite and honeycomb
3654,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Of whitest coral; and with mass on mass
3655,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Of root-like reptiles; writhings turned to rock;
3656,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Huge saurian bulks that, haply, sported there,"
3657,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Convolved; and, in a moment, when the change,--"
3658,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Which made and unmade continents and seas,"
3659,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"That teemed and groaned with mammoth and plesiosaur,--"
3660,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Came, with upheaval of the universe,"
3661,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Thro’ all their monster spines were struck to stone.
3662,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3663,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"There where uprises a wild knoll, o’erstrewn"
3664,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"With wrecks of ancient forest, in mid-stream"
3665,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Once rose an island, green and beautiful"
3666,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"With willow and beech, poplar and sycamore;"
3667,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A river-island where the woodman built,--"
3668,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Stream-guarded from the savage-haunted shore,--"
3669,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,His rude log cabin. Here he sowed his maize;
3670,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Here saw it tassel in the summer heat,"
3671,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And glance like ranks of feathered Indians through
3672,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,The glimmering vistas of the broken wood;
3673,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Here reaped and sheaved its stalks, all ivory-eared,"
3674,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"In shocks like wigwam rows, when like a maid,"
3675,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"An Indian maid, ruddy in dogwood beads,"
3676,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"The autumn came, soft o’er the sunset hills,"
3677,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"That blushed for love, and underneath her feet"
3678,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Cast untold gold in leaves and yellow fruit.
3679,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Here dwelt the pioneer and here he died,"
3680,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And mingled his rough dust with the raw earth
3681,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And loam of what was once an island; now
3682,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A bed of limestone rock and water pools,--"
3683,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Where, in the quarry, you may see the blast"
3684,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Spout heavenward the dust and dirt and stone,"
3685,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And flap and pound its echoes round the hills
3686,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,In giant strokes as of some Titan hammer;--
3687,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"A mound of stump-pierced soil where once an isle,--"
3688,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,As rich and fair in forest and in field
3689,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,As any isle that rises to a sail
3690,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"In tropic seas,--arose to kiss the sun."
3691,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3692,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,There lies the other half of what was once
3693,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Corn Island: broad the channel beats between.
3694,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Lower it lies, and mantled with dwarf brakes"
3695,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Of willow and of cottonwood and beech,"
3696,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Degenerate offsprings of the mighty boles
3697,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,That once o’erbrowed the stream in majesty
3698,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Of tall primeval beauty. In the morn,"
3699,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Ere yet the east assumes its faintest blush,"
3700,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Here you may hear the melancholy snipe
3701,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Piping, or see her paddling in the pools"
3702,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,That splash the low bed of the rocky soil.
3703,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,
3704,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Here once the Indian stole in natural craft
3705,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"From wahoo-bush to bush, from tree to tree,"
3706,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"His head plumes like a bird, below, above,"
3707,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Fluttering and nodding ’mid the undergrowth;
3708,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"In his brown hand the pliant, polished bow,"
3709,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And at his back his gaudy quiver filled
3710,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,With tufted arrows headed blue with flint.
3711,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And while the deep flamingo-colored west
3712,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Flamed on his ruddy cheek, and airy fire"
3713,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Struck rosy ’thwart the stream, he, swift as thought,"
3714,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Strung his quick bow and through the gray wild goose,"
3715,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"That rose with clamor from the rushy pool,"
3716,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Sent a fleet arrow; crested with the quills
3717,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Which yesterday, perhaps, its mate’s gray wing"
3718,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Made beautiful; and plucked to decorate
3719,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,The painted shaft that should to-day speed home
3720,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,And redden all their white with kindred blood:
3721,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"It falling, gasping at his moccasined feet,"
3722,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Breathed out its wild life, while the lonely brave"
3723,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,"Whooped to the sunset, and yon faint blue hills"
3724,THE FALLS OF THE OHIO,Answered his exultation with a whoop.

3753,FALL FANCIES,"Of months, in richness cavalier,"
3754,FALL FANCIES,A minnesinger--lips apout;
3755,FALL FANCIES,A gypsy face; straight as a spear;
3756,FALL FANCIES,A rose stuck in his ear:
3757,FALL FANCIES,
3758,FALL FANCIES,"Eyes, sparkling like old German wine,"
3759,FALL FANCIES,All mirth and moonlight; naught to spare
3760,FALL FANCIES,"Of slender beard, that lent a line"
3761,FALL FANCIES,"Unto his lip; October there,"
3762,FALL FANCIES,With chestnut curling hair.
3763,FALL FANCIES,
3764,FALL FANCIES,His blue baretta swept its plume
3765,FALL FANCIES,"White through the leaves; his purple hose,"
3766,FALL FANCIES,"Puffed at the thighs, made gleam of gloom;"
3767,FALL FANCIES,"His tawny doublet, slashed with rose,"
3768,FALL FANCIES,"And laced with crimson bows,"
3769,FALL FANCIES,
3770,FALL FANCIES,"Outshone the wahoo’s scarlet pride,"
3771,FALL FANCIES,"The haw, in rich vermilion dressed:"
3772,FALL FANCIES,"A dagger dangling at his side,"
3773,FALL FANCIES,"A slim lute, banded to his breast,"
3774,FALL FANCIES,"Whereon his hands did rest,"
3775,FALL FANCIES,
3776,FALL FANCIES,"I saw him come.... And, lo, to hear"
3777,FALL FANCIES,"The lilt of his approaching lute,"
3778,FALL FANCIES,No wonder that the regnant Year
3779,FALL FANCIES,"Bent down her beauty, blushing mute,"

4149,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,All seemed the same: the martin-box--
4150,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,"Sun-warped, with pygmy balconies--"
4151,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,"Still stood, with all its twittering flocks,"
4152,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,Perched on its pole above the peas

4164,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,One dry stagnation. Soaked with hay

4166,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,
4167,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,"I breathed the sultry scents, my eyes"

4172,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,

4178,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,
4179,A FLOWER OF THE FIELDS,"I passed the quince-and pear-tree; where,"

4841,I,There is a song the wet leaves lisp
4842,I,When Morn comes down the woodland way;
4843,I,And misty as a thistle-wisp
4844,I,"Her gown gleams, windy gray:"
4845,I,"A song that seems to say,"
4846,I,“Awake! ’tis day!”
4847,I,
4848,I,There is a sigh when Day sits down
4849,I,Beside the sunlight-lulled lagoon;
4850,I,While on her glistening hair and gown
4851,I,The rose of rest is strew:
4852,I,"A sigh, that seems to croon,"
4853,I,“Come rest! ’tis noon!”
4854,I,
4855,I,"There is a whisper when the stars,"
4856,I,"Above an evening-purpled height,"
4857,I,Crown the dead Day with nenuphars
4858,I,"Of fire, gold and white:"
4859,I,"A voice, that seems t’ invite,"

4864,II,
4865,II,Before the rathe song-sparrow sings
4866,II,"Among the haw-trees in the lane,"
4867,II,And to the wind the locust flings
4868,II,Its early clusters fresh with rain;
4869,II,"Beyond the morning-star, that swings"
4870,II,"Its rose of fire above the spire,"
4871,II,"Between the morning’s watchet wings,"
4872,II,A wild voice rings o’er brooks and boughs--
4873,II,“Arouse! arouse!”
4874,II,
4875,II,Before the first brown owlet cries
4876,II,"Among the grape-vines on the hill,"
4877,II,And in the dam with half-shut eyes
4878,II,The lilies rock above the mill;
4879,II,"Beyond the oblong moon, that flies,"
4880,II,"A pearly flower, above the tower,"
4881,II,"Between the twilight’s primrose skies,"
4882,II,"A soft voice sighs, from east to west--"

4894,RAIN AND WIND,When all the night is shrill
4895,RAIN AND WIND,With wind and rain that beats the pane--
4896,RAIN AND WIND,And my soul with awe is still.
4897,RAIN AND WIND,
4898,RAIN AND WIND,For every dripping window
4899,RAIN AND WIND,"Their headlong rush makes bound,"
4900,RAIN AND WIND,"Galloping up, and galloping by,"
4901,RAIN AND WIND,"Then back again and around,"
4902,RAIN AND WIND,"Till the gusty roofs ring with their hoofs,"
4903,RAIN AND WIND,And the draughty cellars sound.
4904,RAIN AND WIND,
4905,RAIN AND WIND,And then I hear black horsemen
4906,RAIN AND WIND,Hallooing in the night;
4907,RAIN AND WIND,"Hallooing and hallooing,"
4908,RAIN AND WIND,"They ride o’er vale and height,"
4909,RAIN AND WIND,And the branches snap and the shutters clap
4910,RAIN AND WIND,With the fury of their flight.
4911,RAIN AND WIND,
4912,RAIN AND WIND,"Then at each door a horseman,--"
4913,RAIN AND WIND,With burly bearded lip
4914,RAIN AND WIND,"Hallooing through the keyhole,--"
4915,RAIN AND WIND,Pauses with cloak a-drip;
4916,RAIN AND WIND,And the door-knob shakes and the panel quakes
4917,RAIN AND WIND,’Neath the anger of his whip.
4918,RAIN AND WIND,
4919,RAIN AND WIND,"All night I hear their gallop,"
4920,RAIN AND WIND,And their wild halloo’s alarm;
4921,RAIN AND WIND,The tree-tops sound and the vanes go round
4922,RAIN AND WIND,In forest and on farm;
4923,RAIN AND WIND,But never a hair of a thing is there--
4924,RAIN AND WIND,Only the wind and storm.

4951,II,
4952,II,The leafy leash that holds his hounds
4953,II,Is loosed; and all the noonday hush

4955,II,Behind the fox’s bounding brush.
4956,II,
4957,II,When red dusk makes the western sky
4958,II,"A fire-lit window through the firs,"
4959,II,He stoops to see the red fox die
4960,II,Among the chestnut’s broken burrs.
4961,II,
4962,II,"Then fanfaree and fanfaree,"
4963,II,His bugle sounds; the world below

4984,III,

4997,IV,

5334,THE WIND OF SPRING,
5335,THE WIND OF SPRING,"He calls me far a-forest, where"
5336,THE WIND OF SPRING,The twin-leaf and the blood-root bloom;

5343,THE WIND OF SPRING,"And, sparkling in the equal sun,"
5344,THE WIND OF SPRING,"Song leans beside her brimming urn,"
5345,THE WIND OF SPRING,And dreams the dreams that love shall learn.
5346,THE WIND OF SPRING,
5347,THE WIND OF SPRING,"The wind has summoned, and I go:"
5348,THE WIND OF SPRING,To con God’s meaning in each line

5374,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,A cock that flaps and crows; and then--
5375,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,Heard drowsy through the rustling corn--

5379,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,How still again! no water stirs:
5380,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,No wind is heard: although the weeds
5381,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,Are waved a little: and from silk-filled burrs
5382,THE WILLOW BOTTOM,Drift by a few soft seeds.

6319,FOREWORD,What! a face that’s speckled

6541,III,"Cloud-hurrying glimmer,--to the startled ear,"
6542,III,"Crazed, madman snatches of old, perished tunes,"

8099,II,"Long rows of currants and gooseberries,"

8113,II,Where the hornets haunt and the mortar drops

8115,II,Whom vice has aged as the rotting rooms
8116,II,The rain where memories haunt the glooms;
8117,II,A hitch in his joints like the rheum that gnars
8118,II,In the rasping hinge of the door that jars;
8119,II,"A harsh, cracked throat like the old stone flue"
8120,II,Where the swallows build the summer through;--

8143,III,
8144,III,How the sunsets used to stain
8145,III,Mirrors of the waters lying

8147,III,"Where the red-bird, westward flying,"
8148,III,Lit to try its song again.
8149,III,
8150,III,"Dingles, hills and woods, and springs,"
8151,III,"Where we came in calm and storm,"
8152,III,"Swinging in the grapevine swings,"
8153,III,"Wading where the rocks were warm,"
8154,III,With our fishing-nets and strings.
8155,III,
8156,III,"Here the road plunged down the hill,"
8157,III,"Under ash and chinquapin,--"
8158,III,Where the grasshoppers would drill
8159,III,"Ears of silence with their din,--"
8160,III,To the willow-girdled mill.
8161,III,
8162,III,There the path beyond the ford
8163,III,Takes the woodside; just below
8164,III,"Shallows that the lilies sword,"
8165,III,Where the scarlet blossoms blow
8166,III,Of the trumpet-vine and gourd.

8168,III,"Summer winds, that sink with heat,"

8181,III,"Of the peach and nectarine,"

8183,III,"Hazy skirts of gold and green,"
8184,III,Spilling balms of dew and musk.
8185,III,
8186,III,Where with balls of bursting juice
8187,III,Summer sees the red wild-plum
8188,III,"Strew the gravel; ripened loose,"
8189,III,Autumn hears the pawpaw drum
8190,III,Plumpness on the rocks that bruise:
8191,III,
8192,III,"There we found the water-beech,"
8193,III,"One forgotten August noon,"
8194,III,"With a hornet-nest in reach,--"

8196,III,Full of bustling fairy speech.
8197,III,

8200,III,"Waspish cavalry a-buzz,--"
8201,III,"Troopers uniformed in gold,"
8202,III,"Sable-slashed,--to charge on us."
8203,III,

8205,III,Where the dragon-flies would turn
8206,III,Slender flittings into spangle
8207,III,On the sunlight? or would burn--
8208,III,Where the berries made a tangle--
8209,III,

8220,III,With the spice of early May?

8223,III,The old mill? Its weather-beaten

8225,III,"With its warping roof; worm-eaten,"
8226,III,Dusty rafters worn and weak.
8227,III,
8228,III,"Where old shadows haunt old places,"
8229,III,"Loft and hopper, stair and bin;"
8230,III,Ghostly with the dust that laces
8231,III,"Webs that usher phantoms in,"
8232,III,Wistful with remembered faces.
8233,III,
8234,III,While the frogs’ grave litanies

8988,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
8989,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
8990,THE WIND OF SUMMER,From the hills and far away
8991,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"All the long, warm summer day"
8992,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Comes the Wind and seems to say:
8993,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
8994,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“Come, oh, come! and let us go"
8995,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Where the meadows bend and blow,"
8996,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Waving with the white-tops’ snow.
8997,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
8998,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“’Neath the hyssop-colored sky
8999,THE WIND OF SUMMER,’Mid the meadows we will lie
9000,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Watching the white clouds roll by;
9001,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9002,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“While your hair my hands shall press
9003,THE WIND OF SUMMER,With a cooling tenderness
9004,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your grief grows less and less:
9005,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9006,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“Come, oh, come! and let us roam"
9007,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Where the rock-cut waters comb
9008,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Flowing crystal into foam.
9009,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9010,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“Under trees whose trunks are brown,"
9011,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"On the banks that violets crown,"
9012,THE WIND OF SUMMER,We will watch the fish flash down;
9013,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9014,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“While my voice your ear shall soothe
9015,THE WIND OF SUMMER,With a whisper soft and smooth
9016,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your care shall wax uncouth.
9017,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9018,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“Come! where forests, line on line,--"
9019,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Armies of the oak and pine,--"
9020,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Scale the hills and shout and shine.
9021,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9022,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“We will wander, hand in hand,"
9023,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Ways where tall the toadstools stand,"
9024,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Mile-stones white of Fairyland.
9025,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9026,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“While your eyes my lips shall kiss,"
9027,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Dewy as a wild-rose is,"
9028,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till they gaze on naught but bliss.
9029,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9030,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“On the meadows you will hear,"
9031,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Leaning low your spirit ear,"
9032,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Cautious footsteps drawing near.
9033,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9034,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“You will deem it but a bee,"
9035,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Murmuring soft and sleepily,"
9036,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your inner sight shall see
9037,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9038,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“’Tis a presence passing slow,"
9039,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"All its shining hair ablow,"
9040,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Through the white-tops’ tossing snow.
9041,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9042,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“By the waters, if you will,"
9043,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"And your inmost soul is still,"
9044,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Melody your ears shall fill.
9045,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9046,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“You will deem it but the stream
9047,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Rippling onward in a dream,"
9048,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till upon your gaze shall gleam
9049,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9050,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“Arm of spray and throat of foam--
9051,THE WIND OF SUMMER,’Tis a spirit there a-roam
9052,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Where the radiant waters comb.
9053,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9054,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“In the forest, if you heed,"
9055,THE WIND OF SUMMER,You shall hear a magic reed
9056,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Sow sweet notes like silver seed.
9057,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9058,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“You will deem your ears have heard
9059,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Stir of tree or song of bird,"
9060,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your startled eyes are blurred
9061,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9062,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"“By a vision, instant seen,"
9063,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Naked gold and naked green,"
9064,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Glimmering the boughs between.
9065,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9066,THE WIND OF SUMMER,“Follow me! and you shall see
9067,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Wonder-worlds of mystery
9068,THE WIND OF SUMMER,That are only known to me!”
9069,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
9070,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Thus outside my city door
9071,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Speaks the Wind its wildwood lore,"
9072,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Speaks, and lo! I go once more."

9080,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The Winter Wind, the wind of death,"
9081,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Who knocked upon my door,"
9082,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Now through the key-hole entereth,"
9083,THE WIND OF WINTER,Invisible and hoar:
9084,THE WIND OF WINTER,He breathes around his icy breath
9085,THE WIND OF WINTER,And treads the flickering floor.
9086,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9087,THE WIND OF WINTER,"I heard him, wandering in the night,"
9088,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Tap at my window pane,"
9089,THE WIND OF WINTER,"With ghostly fingers, snowy white,"
9090,THE WIND OF WINTER,"I heard him tug in vain,"
9091,THE WIND OF WINTER,Until the shuddering candle-light
9092,THE WIND OF WINTER,Did cringe with fear and strain.
9093,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9094,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The fire, awakened by his voice,"
9095,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Leapt up with frantic arms,"
9096,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Like some wild babe that greets, with noise,"
9097,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Its father home who storms,"
9098,THE WIND OF WINTER,With rosy gestures that rejoice
9099,THE WIND OF WINTER,And crimson kiss that warms.
9100,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9101,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Now in the hearth he sits and, drowned"
9102,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Among the ashes, blows;"
9103,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or through the room goes stealing round
9104,THE WIND OF WINTER,"On cautious-stepping toes,"
9105,THE WIND OF WINTER,Deep-mantled in the drowsy sound
9106,THE WIND OF WINTER,Of night that sleets and snows.
9107,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9108,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And oft, like some thin fairy-thing,"
9109,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The stormy hush amid,"
9110,THE WIND OF WINTER,I hear his captive trebles ring
9111,THE WIND OF WINTER,Beneath the kettle’s lid;
9112,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or now a harp of elfland string
9113,THE WIND OF WINTER,In some dark cranny hid.
9114,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9115,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Again I hear him, imp-like, whine,"
9116,THE WIND OF WINTER,Cramped in the gusty flue;
9117,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or knotted in the resinous pine
9118,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Raise goblin cry and hue,"
9119,THE WIND OF WINTER,"While through the smoke his eyeballs shine,"
9120,THE WIND OF WINTER,A sooty red and blue.
9121,THE WIND OF WINTER,
9122,THE WIND OF WINTER,"At last I hear him, nearing dawn,"
9123,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Take up his roaring broom,"
9124,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And sweep wild leaves from wood and lawn,"
9125,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And from the heavens the gloom,"
9126,THE WIND OF WINTER,"To show the gaunt world lying wan,"
9127,THE WIND OF WINTER,And morn’s cold rose a-bloom.

9156,II,Of cobwebbed rain--held up at airy angle;
9157,II,"I hear thy tinkle,"
9158,II,"Thy fairy notes, the silvery stillness sprinkle;"
9159,II,Investing wholly
9160,II,The moonlight with divinest melancholy:
9161,II,"Until, in seeming,"
9162,II,I see the Spirit of the Summer dreaming
9163,II,"Amid her ripened orchards, apple-strewn,"

9172,III,"Of melody, now near; now, like some taper"
9173,III,"Of sound, far fading--"
9174,III,Thou will-o’-wisp of music aye evading.
9175,III,"Among the bowers,"
9176,III,"The fog-washed stalks of Autumn’s weeds and flowers,"
9177,III,"By hill and hollow,"
9178,III,I hear thy murmur and in vain I follow--
9179,III,"Thou jack-o’-lantern voice, thou elfin cry,"

9188,IV,The mire of lanes; and dropping acorns patter
9189,IV,"In grove and forest,"
9190,IV,"Like some frail grief, with the rude blast thou warrest,"
9191,IV,Sending thy slender
9192,IV,"Far cry against the gale, that, rough, untender,"
9193,IV,"Untouched of sorrow,"
9194,IV,"Sweeps thee aside, where, haply, I to-morrow"

9342,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"And pennyroyal drench her gown,"

9344,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Among the thorns, and everywhere the glint"

9451,JULY,"Among the trees; and, by the wooded stream,"
9452,JULY,"In many a fragrant ball,"
9453,JULY,Blooms of the button-bush fall.
9454,JULY,
9455,JULY,Let us go forth and seek
9456,JULY,Woods where the wild plums redden and the beech
9457,JULY,"Plumps its stout burrs; and, swelling, just in reach,"
9458,JULY,"The pawpaw, emerald-sleek,"
9459,JULY,Ripens along the creek.
9460,JULY,
9461,JULY,Now ’tis the time when ways
9462,JULY,Of glimmering green flaunt white the giant plumes
9463,JULY,"Of the black-cohosh; and through bramble glooms,--"
9464,JULY,"A blur of orange rays,--"
9465,JULY,The butterfly-blossoms blaze.
9466,JULY,
9467,JULY,Let us go forth and hear
9468,JULY,"The spiral music that the locusts beat,"
9469,JULY,"And that small spray of sound, so grassy sweet,"
9470,JULY,"Dear to a country ear,"
9471,JULY,The cricket’s summer cheer.
9472,JULY,
9473,JULY,Now golden celandine
9474,JULY,"Is hairy hung with silvery sacs of seeds,"
9475,JULY,"And bugled o’er with freckled gold, like beads,"
9476,JULY,"Beneath the fox-grape vine,"
9477,JULY,The jewel-weed’s blossoms shine.
9478,JULY,
9479,JULY,Let us go forth and see
9480,JULY,"The dragon-and the butterfly, like gems,"
9481,JULY,"Spangling the sunbeams; and the clover stems,"
9482,JULY,"Weighed down with many a bee,"
9483,JULY,Nodding mellifluously.
9484,JULY,
9485,JULY,Now morns are full of song;
9486,JULY,The cat-bird and the red-bird and the jay
9487,JULY,"Upon the hilltops rouse the ruddy day,"
9488,JULY,"Who, dewy, blithe, and strong,"
9489,JULY,Lures their wild wings along.
9490,JULY,
9491,JULY,Now noons are full of dreams;
9492,JULY,The clouds of heaven and the wandering breeze
9493,JULY,"Follow a vision; and the flowers and trees,"
9494,JULY,"The hills and fields and streams,"
9495,JULY,Are lapped in mystic gleams.
9496,JULY,
9497,JULY,The nights are full of love;
9498,JULY,The stars and moon take up the golden tale
9499,JULY,"Of the sunk sun, and passionate and pale,"
9500,JULY,"Mixing their fires above,"
9501,JULY,Grow eloquent thereof.
9502,JULY,
9503,JULY,Such days are like a sigh
9504,JULY,That beauty heaves from a full heart of bliss:

10365,THE WOOD WITCH,"The blue turn gray, the gray turn gold"
10366,THE WOOD WITCH,Of hollow heaven; and the brown
10367,THE WOOD WITCH,Of twilight vistas twinkled down

10370,THE WOOD WITCH,Slow-syllabled of weed and bloom.
10371,THE WOOD WITCH,"But, in the night, at languid rest,--"
