98,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.
99,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
100,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
101,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their"
102,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little"
103,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,"
104,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts
105,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a"
106,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The"
107,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.
108,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an"
109,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all
110,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,_curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The
111,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are
112,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,preposterous.
113,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
114,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of"
115,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable"
116,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display"
117,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the
118,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily
119,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been"
120,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.
121,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
122,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of"
123,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an"
124,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or
125,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that"
126,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting"
127,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,"
128,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather"
129,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry
130,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,may at any time be successfully attempted.
131,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
132,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough"
133,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being"
134,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,"
135,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,"
136,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two"
137,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of"
138,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole"
139,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once"
140,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable"
141,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,to the one primitive folly.
142,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
143,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist
144,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to
145,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual"
146,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would
147,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are
148,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of
149,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits
150,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber."
151,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
152,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several
153,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation"
154,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic
155,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly
156,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines
157,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,"
158,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.
159,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
160,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other"
161,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an"
162,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,"
163,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the"
164,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect."
165,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
166,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still"
167,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the
168,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the
169,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary
170,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard
171,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows"
172,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their
173,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have
174,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of"
175,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards
176,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect"
177,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching"
178,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree
179,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct"
180,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are"
181,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of"
182,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of"
183,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or"
184,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly"
185,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen
186,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and"
187,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among"
188,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention
189,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and
190,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize"
191,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established"
192,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.
193,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
194,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,_Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household
195,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion
196,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.
197,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady
198,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or"
199,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do"
200,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely
201,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp"
202,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass"
203,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is"
204,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted
205,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"it, partly on account of its _flashiness_, but principally on account"
206,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"of its _greater rest_, is a good commentary on the proposition with"
207,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of"
208,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly"
209,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of
210,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is"
211,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its
212,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half"
213,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,disenchanted beneath its evil eye.
214,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
215,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its"
216,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of
217,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes"
218,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,_pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the
219,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,"
220,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning
221,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle"
222,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of"
223,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.
224,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
225,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before
226,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has"
227,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our"
228,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine"
229,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one
230,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and"
231,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror"
232,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing"
233,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent"
234,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here
235,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its"
236,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four"
237,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,"
238,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter"
239,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing"
240,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,"
241,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be"
242,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the
243,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be"
244,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.
245,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
246,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man"
247,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The
248,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.
249,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our"
250,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"_aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the"
251,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in
252,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]
253,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d"
254,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"_cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is"
255,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose"
256,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the
257,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of
258,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,the room during his slumber.
259,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,
260,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a
261,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of
262,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is
263,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the"
264,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep"
265,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a
266,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual."
267,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to"
268,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the"
269,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a"
270,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material"
271,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole
272,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),"
273,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles"
274,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown
275,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping"
276,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such"
277,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the
278,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and"
279,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony
280,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson"
281,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that"
282,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,"
283,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,_and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short
284,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls
285,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small"
286,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many
287,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an
288,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the"
289,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or"
290,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully."
291,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant"
292,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.
293,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the"
294,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad
295,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed."
296,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,"
297,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to
298,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of"
299,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is
300,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a
301,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary
302,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson
303,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light"
304,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,"
305,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed"
306,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the"
307,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has
308,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which"
309,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded"
310,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with"
311,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some"
312,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk"
313,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound"
314,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand"
315,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from"
316,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,"He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a"
317,PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.,tranquil but magical radiance over all.

353,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their
354,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us
355,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver"
356,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,shekels per head!”
357,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
358,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
359,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the"
360,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,"
361,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,"
362,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”"

364,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
365,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged"
366,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of
367,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,_dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a
368,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less
369,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a"
370,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a"
371,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of
372,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated
373,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”
374,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
375,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted"
376,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or"
377,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings"
378,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not
379,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”"
380,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
381,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
382,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which"
383,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly"
384,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty
385,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the"
386,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its"
387,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square"
388,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and"
389,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the"
390,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,"
391,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a
392,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the"
393,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived
394,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the
395,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the"
396,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an
397,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by"
398,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"several, that of the temple of Belus."
399,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
400,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,"
401,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,“the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the
402,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”
403,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
404,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
405,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,"
406,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who
407,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”
408,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
409,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
410,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,“Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman
411,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions"
412,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has
413,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your
414,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought"
415,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a"
416,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the"
417,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the"
418,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every"
419,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and"
420,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”
421,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
422,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
423,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the"
424,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against"
425,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth
426,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of"
427,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is"
428,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or
429,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or"
430,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or
431,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”
432,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
433,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
434,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,“Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too
435,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on
436,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the"
437,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,holy things of the sanctuary.”

439,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
440,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden"
441,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the"
442,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but"
443,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of"
444,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,their operations could be obtained.
445,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
446,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,Half an hour had already elapsed.
447,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
448,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this"
449,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be
450,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,turned out of office by the Katholim.”
451,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
452,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
453,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the"

455,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”
456,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
457,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
458,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"“Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase"

460,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
461,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
462,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,“They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they
463,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,"
464,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either"
465,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to"
466,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while"
467,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.

472,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was
473,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.
474,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,
475,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,“Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of
476,A TALE OF JERUSALEM,"Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”"

503,THE SPHINX,
504,THE SPHINX,
505,THE SPHINX,"During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the"
506,THE SPHINX,invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement
507,THE SPHINX,of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around
508,THE SPHINX,us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in
509,THE SPHINX,"the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we"
510,THE SPHINX,"should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful"
511,THE SPHINX,intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a
512,THE SPHINX,day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some
513,THE SPHINX,"acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily"
514,THE SPHINX,the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every
515,THE SPHINX,messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.
516,THE SPHINX,"That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could"
517,THE SPHINX,"neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less"
518,THE SPHINX,"excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted"
519,THE SPHINX,himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at
520,THE SPHINX,any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was
521,THE SPHINX,"sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension."
522,THE SPHINX,
523,THE SPHINX,His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which
524,THE SPHINX,"I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which"
525,THE SPHINX,I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into
526,THE SPHINX,germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my
527,THE SPHINX,"bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he"
528,THE SPHINX,was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been
529,THE SPHINX,made upon my fancy.
530,THE SPHINX,
531,THE SPHINX,A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief
532,THE SPHINX,"which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to"
533,THE SPHINX,defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he
534,THE SPHINX,"maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I"
535,THE SPHINX,contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute
536,THE SPHINX,"spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of"
537,THE SPHINX,"suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and"
538,THE SPHINX,was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the
539,THE SPHINX,idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.
540,THE SPHINX,
541,THE SPHINX,"The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred"
542,THE SPHINX,"to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so"
543,THE SPHINX,"much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for"
544,THE SPHINX,"regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded"
545,THE SPHINX,"and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind"
546,THE SPHINX,to communicate the circumstances to my friend.
547,THE SPHINX,
548,THE SPHINX,"Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an"
549,THE SPHINX,"open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view"
550,THE SPHINX,"of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded"
551,THE SPHINX,"by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My"
552,THE SPHINX,thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom
553,THE SPHINX,"and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,"
554,THE SPHINX,"they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon"
555,THE SPHINX,"some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its"
556,THE SPHINX,"way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense"
557,THE SPHINX,"forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own"
558,THE SPHINX,sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes
559,THE SPHINX,passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor
560,THE SPHINX,"in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and"
561,THE SPHINX,"calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I"
562,THE SPHINX,"fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than"
563,THE SPHINX,even I did myself.
564,THE SPHINX,
565,THE SPHINX,Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the
566,THE SPHINX,large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which
567,THE SPHINX,had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far
568,THE SPHINX,"larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,"
569,THE SPHINX,because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one
570,THE SPHINX,of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the
571,THE SPHINX,general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of
572,THE SPHINX,"a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as"
573,THE SPHINX,the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an
574,THE SPHINX,immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been
575,THE SPHINX,supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this
576,THE SPHINX,"hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those"
577,THE SPHINX,"of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,"
578,THE SPHINX,"parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,"
579,THE SPHINX,"thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in"
580,THE SPHINX,"shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the"
581,THE SPHINX,rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the
582,THE SPHINX,apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each
583,THE SPHINX,wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above
584,THE SPHINX,"the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale"
585,THE SPHINX,apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper
586,THE SPHINX,and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief
587,THE SPHINX,peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s
588,THE SPHINX,"Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was"
589,THE SPHINX,"as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,"
590,THE SPHINX,as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded
591,THE SPHINX,"the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,"
592,THE SPHINX,with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming
593,THE SPHINX,"evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I"
594,THE SPHINX,perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand
595,THE SPHINX,"themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so"
596,THE SPHINX,"expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the"
597,THE SPHINX,"monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to"
598,THE SPHINX,the floor.
599,THE SPHINX,
600,THE SPHINX,"Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of"
601,THE SPHINX,what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of
602,THE SPHINX,"repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me."
603,THE SPHINX,
604,THE SPHINX,"At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we"
605,THE SPHINX,were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I
606,THE SPHINX,"occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near"
607,THE SPHINX,at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an
608,THE SPHINX,account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed
609,THE SPHINX,"heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if"
610,THE SPHINX,my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a
611,THE SPHINX,"distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute"
612,THE SPHINX,"terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but"
613,THE SPHINX,maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the
614,THE SPHINX,"course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the"
615,THE SPHINX,hill.
616,THE SPHINX,
617,THE SPHINX,"I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an"
618,THE SPHINX,"omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I"
619,THE SPHINX,"threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my"
620,THE SPHINX,"face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer"
621,THE SPHINX,apparent.
622,THE SPHINX,
623,THE SPHINX,"My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,"
624,THE SPHINX,and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the
625,THE SPHINX,"visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed"
626,THE SPHINX,"deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,"
627,THE SPHINX,"with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative"
628,THE SPHINX,"philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us."
629,THE SPHINX,I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the
630,THE SPHINX,idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in
631,THE SPHINX,the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the
632,THE SPHINX,"importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its"
633,THE SPHINX,"propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence"
634,THE SPHINX,to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of
635,THE SPHINX,"Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly"
636,THE SPHINX,be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can
637,THE SPHINX,you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought
638,THE SPHINX,this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”
639,THE SPHINX,
640,THE SPHINX,
641,THE SPHINX,"He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one"
642,THE SPHINX,of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to
643,THE SPHINX,"exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine"
644,THE SPHINX,"print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the"
645,THE SPHINX,"book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before."
646,THE SPHINX,
647,THE SPHINX,"“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,"
648,THE SPHINX,I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.
649,THE SPHINX,"In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus"
650,THE SPHINX,"Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class"
651,THE SPHINX,of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:
652,THE SPHINX,
653,THE SPHINX,“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic
654,THE SPHINX,"appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of"
655,THE SPHINX,"the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and"
656,THE SPHINX,downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;
657,THE SPHINX,"antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The"
658,THE SPHINX,"Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,"
659,THE SPHINX,"at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia"
660,THE SPHINX,of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”
661,THE SPHINX,
662,THE SPHINX,
663,THE SPHINX,"He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself"
664,THE SPHINX,accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding
665,THE SPHINX,“the monster.”
666,THE SPHINX,
667,THE SPHINX,
668,THE SPHINX,"“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face"
669,THE SPHINX,"of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be."
670,THE SPHINX,"Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for"
671,THE SPHINX,"the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider"
672,THE SPHINX,"has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of"
673,THE SPHINX,"an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch"
674,THE SPHINX,distant from the pupil of my eye.”

680,HOP-FROG,
681,HOP-FROG,
682,HOP-FROG,I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed
683,HOP-FROG,"to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to"
684,HOP-FROG,"tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his"
685,HOP-FROG,seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They
686,HOP-FROG,"all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well"
687,HOP-FROG,"as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there"
688,HOP-FROG,"is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been"
689,HOP-FROG,quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara
690,HOP-FROG,avis in terris.
691,HOP-FROG,
692,HOP-FROG,"About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king"
693,HOP-FROG,troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in
694,HOP-FROG,"a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it."
695,HOP-FROG,Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”
696,HOP-FROG,"to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited"
697,HOP-FROG,his taste far better than verbal ones.
698,HOP-FROG,
699,HOP-FROG,"At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone"
700,HOP-FROG,out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still
701,HOP-FROG,"retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were"
702,HOP-FROG,"expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,"
703,HOP-FROG,in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.
704,HOP-FROG,
705,HOP-FROG,"_Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he"
706,HOP-FROG,_required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the
707,HOP-FROG,heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to
708,HOP-FROG,mention himself.
709,HOP-FROG,
710,HOP-FROG,"His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value"
711,HOP-FROG,"was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf"
712,HOP-FROG,"and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;"
713,HOP-FROG,and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days
714,HOP-FROG,(days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to
715,HOP-FROG,"laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your"
716,HOP-FROG,"jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and"
717,HOP-FROG,unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our
718,HOP-FROG,"king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a"
719,HOP-FROG,triplicate treasure in one person.
720,HOP-FROG,
721,HOP-FROG,I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his
722,HOP-FROG,"sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of"
723,HOP-FROG,"the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men"
724,HOP-FROG,"do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional"
725,HOP-FROG,gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that
726,HOP-FROG,"afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,"
727,HOP-FROG,for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional
728,HOP-FROG,"swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a"
729,HOP-FROG,capital figure.
730,HOP-FROG,
731,HOP-FROG,"But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only"
732,HOP-FROG,"with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious"
733,HOP-FROG,"muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way"
734,HOP-FROG,"of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform"
735,HOP-FROG,"many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,"
736,HOP-FROG,or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more
737,HOP-FROG,"resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog."
738,HOP-FROG,
739,HOP-FROG,"I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog"
740,HOP-FROG,"originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no"
741,HOP-FROG,person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.
742,HOP-FROG,"Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself"
743,HOP-FROG,"(although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been"
744,HOP-FROG,"forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,"
745,HOP-FROG,"and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals."
746,HOP-FROG,
747,HOP-FROG,"Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close"
748,HOP-FROG,"intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became"
749,HOP-FROG,"sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was"
750,HOP-FROG,"by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many"
751,HOP-FROG,"services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although"
752,HOP-FROG,"a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much"
753,HOP-FROG,"influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit"
754,HOP-FROG,of Hop-Frog.
755,HOP-FROG,
756,HOP-FROG,On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined
757,HOP-FROG,"to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,"
758,HOP-FROG,"occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta"
759,HOP-FROG,"were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive"
760,HOP-FROG,"in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and"
761,HOP-FROG,"arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it"
762,HOP-FROG,"seems, without his assistance."
763,HOP-FROG,
764,HOP-FROG,The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been
765,HOP-FROG,"fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could"
766,HOP-FROG,possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of
767,HOP-FROG,"expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed"
768,HOP-FROG,that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up
769,HOP-FROG,"their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,"
770,HOP-FROG,"in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except"
771,HOP-FROG,in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never
772,HOP-FROG,"could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found"
773,HOP-FROG,"it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all"
774,HOP-FROG,"events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and"
775,HOP-FROG,Hop-Frog.
776,HOP-FROG,
777,HOP-FROG,When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him
778,HOP-FROG,sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the
779,HOP-FROG,monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not
780,HOP-FROG,"fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and"
781,HOP-FROG,"madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,"
782,HOP-FROG,and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)
783,HOP-FROG,“to be merry.”
784,HOP-FROG,
785,HOP-FROG,"“Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the"
786,HOP-FROG,"room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here"
787,HOP-FROG,"Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We"
788,HOP-FROG,"want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of"
789,HOP-FROG,"the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the"
790,HOP-FROG,wine will brighten your wits.”
791,HOP-FROG,
792,HOP-FROG,
793,HOP-FROG,"Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances"
794,HOP-FROG,from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor
795,HOP-FROG,"dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced"
796,HOP-FROG,"the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he"
797,HOP-FROG,"took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant."
798,HOP-FROG,
799,HOP-FROG,"“Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly"
800,HOP-FROG,"drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,"
801,HOP-FROG,your eyes are shining already!”
802,HOP-FROG,
803,HOP-FROG,
804,HOP-FROG,"Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of"
805,HOP-FROG,wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He
806,HOP-FROG,"placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the"
807,HOP-FROG,company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at
808,HOP-FROG,the success of the king’s ‘joke.’
809,HOP-FROG,
810,HOP-FROG,"“And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man."
811,HOP-FROG,
812,HOP-FROG,"“Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your"
813,HOP-FROG,"assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of"
814,HOP-FROG,characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was
815,HOP-FROG,"seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven."
816,HOP-FROG,
817,HOP-FROG,"Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly."
818,HOP-FROG,
819,HOP-FROG,"“Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”"
820,HOP-FROG,
821,HOP-FROG,
822,HOP-FROG,"“I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,"
823,HOP-FROG,"abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine."
824,HOP-FROG,
825,HOP-FROG,"“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you"
826,HOP-FROG,"mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine."
827,HOP-FROG,"Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and"
828,HOP-FROG,"offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath."
829,HOP-FROG,
830,HOP-FROG,"“Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the"
831,HOP-FROG,fiends—”
832,HOP-FROG,
833,HOP-FROG,
834,HOP-FROG,The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers
835,HOP-FROG,"smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,"
836,HOP-FROG,"falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend."
837,HOP-FROG,
838,HOP-FROG,"The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her"
839,HOP-FROG,audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most
840,HOP-FROG,"becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a"
841,HOP-FROG,"syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the"
842,HOP-FROG,brimming goblet in her face.
843,HOP-FROG,
844,HOP-FROG,"The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,"
845,HOP-FROG,resumed her position at the foot of the table.
846,HOP-FROG,
847,HOP-FROG,"There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling"
848,HOP-FROG,"of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a"
849,HOP-FROG,"low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once"
850,HOP-FROG,from every corner of the room.
851,HOP-FROG,
852,HOP-FROG,“What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the
853,HOP-FROG,"king, turning furiously to the dwarf."
854,HOP-FROG,
855,HOP-FROG,"The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his"
856,HOP-FROG,"intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,"
857,HOP-FROG,merely ejaculated:
858,HOP-FROG,
859,HOP-FROG,“I—I? How could it have been me?”
860,HOP-FROG,
861,HOP-FROG,
862,HOP-FROG,"“The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers."
863,HOP-FROG,"“I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his"
864,HOP-FROG,cage-wires.”
865,HOP-FROG,
866,HOP-FROG,
867,HOP-FROG,"“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,"
868,HOP-FROG,"on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of"
869,HOP-FROG,this vagabond’s teeth.”
870,HOP-FROG,
871,HOP-FROG,
872,HOP-FROG,Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object
873,HOP-FROG,"to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very"
874,HOP-FROG,"repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as"
875,HOP-FROG,much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another
876,HOP-FROG,"bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and"
877,HOP-FROG,"with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade."
878,HOP-FROG,
879,HOP-FROG,"“I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very"
880,HOP-FROG,"tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just"
881,HOP-FROG,"after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just"
882,HOP-FROG,"after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd"
883,HOP-FROG,"noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one"
884,HOP-FROG,"of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our"
885,HOP-FROG,"masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,"
886,HOP-FROG,it requires a company of eight persons and—”
887,HOP-FROG,
888,HOP-FROG,
889,HOP-FROG,"“Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the"
890,HOP-FROG,coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!
891,HOP-FROG,what is the diversion?”
892,HOP-FROG,
893,HOP-FROG,
894,HOP-FROG,"“We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and"
895,HOP-FROG,it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”
896,HOP-FROG,
897,HOP-FROG,
898,HOP-FROG,"“We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering"
899,HOP-FROG,his eyelids.
900,HOP-FROG,
901,HOP-FROG,"“The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it"
902,HOP-FROG,occasions among the women.”
903,HOP-FROG,
904,HOP-FROG,
905,HOP-FROG,“Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.
906,HOP-FROG,
907,HOP-FROG,"“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that"
908,HOP-FROG,"to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of"
909,HOP-FROG,"masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will"
910,HOP-FROG,be as much terrified as astonished.”
911,HOP-FROG,
912,HOP-FROG,
913,HOP-FROG,"“Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man"
914,HOP-FROG,of you.”
915,HOP-FROG,
916,HOP-FROG,
917,HOP-FROG,“The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their
918,HOP-FROG,"jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers."
919,HOP-FROG,"Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by"
920,HOP-FROG,"eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the"
921,HOP-FROG,"company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately"
922,HOP-FROG,and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”
923,HOP-FROG,
924,HOP-FROG,
925,HOP-FROG,"“It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was"
926,HOP-FROG,"growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog."
927,HOP-FROG,
928,HOP-FROG,"His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but"
929,HOP-FROG,"effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the"
930,HOP-FROG,"epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized"
931,HOP-FROG,world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently
932,HOP-FROG,"beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to"
933,HOP-FROG,nature was thus thought to be secured.
934,HOP-FROG,
935,HOP-FROG,The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet
936,HOP-FROG,shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of
937,HOP-FROG,"the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion"
938,HOP-FROG,"was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by"
939,HOP-FROG,"ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang"
940,HOP-FROG,was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of
941,HOP-FROG,the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long
942,HOP-FROG,"chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,"
943,HOP-FROG,"_and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then"
944,HOP-FROG,"about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining"
945,HOP-FROG,"arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each"
946,HOP-FROG,"other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear"
947,HOP-FROG,"natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at"
948,HOP-FROG,"right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the"
949,HOP-FROG,"present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in"
950,HOP-FROG,Borneo.
951,HOP-FROG,
952,HOP-FROG,"The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular"
953,HOP-FROG,"room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single"
954,HOP-FROG,window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially
955,HOP-FROG,"designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending"
956,HOP-FROG,"by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by"
957,HOP-FROG,means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)
958,HOP-FROG,this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.
959,HOP-FROG,
960,HOP-FROG,The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;
961,HOP-FROG,"but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer"
962,HOP-FROG,"judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this"
963,HOP-FROG,"occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in"
964,HOP-FROG,"weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been"
965,HOP-FROG,"seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account"
966,HOP-FROG,"of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from"
967,HOP-FROG,"out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional"
968,HOP-FROG,"sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a"
969,HOP-FROG,"flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the"
970,HOP-FROG,Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or
971,HOP-FROG,sixty altogether.
972,HOP-FROG,
973,HOP-FROG,"The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until"
974,HOP-FROG,midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before
975,HOP-FROG,"making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,"
976,HOP-FROG,"than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the"
977,HOP-FROG,"impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to"
978,HOP-FROG,stumble as they entered.
979,HOP-FROG,
980,HOP-FROG,"The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart"
981,HOP-FROG,"of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of"
982,HOP-FROG,the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of
983,HOP-FROG,"some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women"
984,HOP-FROG,swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to
985,HOP-FROG,"exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated"
986,HOP-FROG,"their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the"
987,HOP-FROG,doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his
988,HOP-FROG,"entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with"
989,HOP-FROG,him.
990,HOP-FROG,
991,HOP-FROG,"While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to"
992,HOP-FROG,"his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure"
993,HOP-FROG,"of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,"
994,HOP-FROG,"and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very"
995,HOP-FROG,"gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of"
996,HOP-FROG,the floor.
997,HOP-FROG,
998,HOP-FROG,"Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the"
999,HOP-FROG,"hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,"
1000,HOP-FROG,"of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus"
1001,HOP-FROG,"situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting"
1002,HOP-FROG,"them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the"
1003,HOP-FROG,intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically
1004,HOP-FROG,"and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the"
1005,HOP-FROG,"hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an"
1006,HOP-FROG,"instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far"
1007,HOP-FROG,"upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable"
1008,HOP-FROG,"consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and"
1009,HOP-FROG,face to face.
1010,HOP-FROG,
1011,HOP-FROG,"The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their"
1012,HOP-FROG,"alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived"
1013,HOP-FROG,"pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the"
1014,HOP-FROG,apes.
1015,HOP-FROG,
1016,HOP-FROG,"“Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself"
1017,HOP-FROG,easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.
1018,HOP-FROG,"If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”"
1019,HOP-FROG,
1020,HOP-FROG,
1021,HOP-FROG,"Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the"
1022,HOP-FROG,"wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,"
1023,HOP-FROG,"as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a"
1024,HOP-FROG,"monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the"
1025,HOP-FROG,"chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and"
1026,HOP-FROG,still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”
1027,HOP-FROG,
1028,HOP-FROG,
1029,HOP-FROG,"And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with"
1030,HOP-FROG,"laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain"
1031,HOP-FROG,flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the
1032,HOP-FROG,"dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in"
1033,HOP-FROG,"mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the"
1034,HOP-FROG,"chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the"
1035,HOP-FROG,"eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to"
1036,HOP-FROG,"thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who"
1037,HOP-FROG,they were.
1038,HOP-FROG,
1039,HOP-FROG,"So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead"
1040,HOP-FROG,"silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such"
1041,HOP-FROG,"a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the"
1042,HOP-FROG,king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of
1043,HOP-FROG,"Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to"
1044,HOP-FROG,whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the
1045,HOP-FROG,"dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and"
1046,HOP-FROG,"glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned"
1047,HOP-FROG,countenances of the king and his seven companions.
1048,HOP-FROG,
1049,HOP-FROG,"“Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see"
1050,HOP-FROG,"who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more"
1051,HOP-FROG,"closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and"
1052,HOP-FROG,which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a
1053,HOP-FROG,"minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the"
1054,HOP-FROG,"shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,"
1055,HOP-FROG,and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.
1056,HOP-FROG,
1057,HOP-FROG,"At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester"
1058,HOP-FROG,"to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made"
1059,HOP-FROG,"this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence."
1060,HOP-FROG,"The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:"
1061,HOP-FROG,
1062,HOP-FROG,"“I now see distinctly,” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are."
1063,HOP-FROG,"They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who"
1064,HOP-FROG,does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors
1065,HOP-FROG,"who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the"
1066,HOP-FROG,jester—and this is my last jest.”
1067,HOP-FROG,
1068,HOP-FROG,
1069,HOP-FROG,Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it
1070,HOP-FROG,"adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the"
1071,HOP-FROG,"work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a"
1072,HOP-FROG,"fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled"
1073,HOP-FROG,"his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared"
1074,HOP-FROG,through the sky-light.
1075,HOP-FROG,
1076,HOP-FROG,"It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had"
1077,HOP-FROG,"been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,"
1078,HOP-FROG,"together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was"
1079,HOP-FROG,seen again.

1087,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1088,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1089,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht
1090,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some
1091,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in
1092,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them"
1093,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of
1094,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer"
1095,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes"
1096,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the
1097,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.
1098,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1099,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the"
1100,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some
1101,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with"
1102,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so"
1103,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest
1104,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the"
1105,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,αχλυξ η πριυ
1106,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,"
1107,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet"
1108,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely"
1109,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many
1110,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest
1111,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had"
1112,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring"
1113,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the"
1114,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street."
1115,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1116,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had"
1117,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,"
1118,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well"
1119,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past"
1120,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been
1121,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,"
1122,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all"
1123,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of"
1124,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the scene without.
1125,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1126,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked
1127,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate"
1128,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute"
1129,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,"
1130,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,and expression of countenance.
1131,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1132,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied
1133,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way"
1134,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;"
1135,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of
1136,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a"
1137,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and"
1138,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on"
1139,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their
1140,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their"
1141,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the"
1142,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed"
1143,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There"
1144,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I
1145,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly
1146,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,"
1147,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of"
1148,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their
1149,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not
1150,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,greatly excite my attention.
1151,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1152,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable
1153,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young
1154,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and"
1155,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which"
1156,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these"
1157,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection
1158,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off
1159,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best"
1160,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,definition of the class.
1161,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1162,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old"
1163,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats"
1164,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white"
1165,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or"
1166,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right"
1167,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I"
1168,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,"
1169,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient"
1170,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed
1171,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,there be an affectation so honorable.
1172,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1173,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily"
1174,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all
1175,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much
1176,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be"
1177,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of
1178,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once."
1179,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1180,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily"
1181,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the"
1182,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,"
1183,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate"
1184,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still"
1185,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a"
1186,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two"
1187,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded"
1188,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of"
1189,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in"
1190,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat"
1191,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be"
1192,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon
1193,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the
1194,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and
1195,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns."
1196,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1197,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and"
1198,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing"
1199,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of
1200,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon
1201,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the"
1202,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed"
1203,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every"
1204,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,"
1205,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a
1206,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the"
1207,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;"
1208,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal
1209,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in"
1210,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with"
1211,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the
1212,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at"
1213,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,"
1214,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid"
1215,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards
1216,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,"
1217,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole"
1218,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual"
1219,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials"
1220,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well"
1221,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy
1222,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously"
1223,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode"
1224,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside"
1225,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,"
1226,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who"
1227,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all"
1228,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the
1229,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye."
1230,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1231,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for"
1232,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its
1233,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly
1234,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,"
1235,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but"
1236,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the"
1237,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing"
1238,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony
1239,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.
1240,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1241,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual
1242,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted
1243,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each"
1244,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could"
1245,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of"
1246,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,long years.
1247,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1248,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,"
1249,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old
1250,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which"
1251,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the"
1252,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely
1253,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that
1254,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,"
1255,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the
1256,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to"
1257,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and"
1258,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,"
1259,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood"
1260,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of"
1261,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How"
1262,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then"
1263,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.
1264,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my"
1265,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I"
1266,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little
1267,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed"
1268,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention."
1269,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1270,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in
1271,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,"
1272,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong"
1273,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of"
1274,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a"
1275,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped
1276,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These"
1277,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the"
1278,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,stranger whithersoever he should go.
1279,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1280,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,"
1281,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd
1282,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new"
1283,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the"
1284,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did"
1285,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system
1286,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a
1287,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held"
1288,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked
1289,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning
1290,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a"
1291,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so"
1292,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his
1293,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than
1294,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way
1295,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at"
1296,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a"
1297,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,"
1298,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number
1299,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a
1300,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,difference is there between a London populace and that of the most
1301,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,"
1302,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the"
1303,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled"
1304,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who"
1305,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was
1306,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the"
1307,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished"
1308,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting
1309,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,me as he came round with a sudden movement.
1310,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1311,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with"
1312,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;
1313,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a
1314,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively"
1315,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an"
1316,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put"
1317,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and
1318,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well"
1319,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he"
1320,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and"
1321,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,sellers.
1322,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1323,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,"
1324,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without
1325,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc
1326,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he"
1327,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke"
1328,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now"
1329,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not"
1330,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.
1331,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1332,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the"
1333,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and"
1334,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into
1335,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with"
1336,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we"
1337,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the
1338,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same"
1339,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and"
1340,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked
1341,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,"
1342,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great"
1343,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the"
1344,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were"
1345,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he
1346,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his
1347,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his"
1348,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now
1349,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,"
1350,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his"
1351,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,actions.
1352,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1353,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness"
1354,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of
1355,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped
1356,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane"
1357,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in"
1358,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which"
1359,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from"
1360,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of
1361,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable"
1362,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an"
1363,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen"
1364,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce"
1365,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones
1366,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass."
1367,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere
1368,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life"
1369,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned"
1370,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old
1371,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more"
1372,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze"
1373,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge"
1374,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,"
1375,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,Gin.
1376,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,
1377,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still
1378,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy
1379,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original"
1380,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among"
1381,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to"
1382,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was
1383,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the
1384,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.
1385,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced"
1386,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he"
1387,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to"
1388,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun
1389,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most"
1390,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——"
1391,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely"
1392,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid"
1393,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the"
1394,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not"
1395,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the"
1396,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in"
1397,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed"
1398,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained"
1399,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,"
1400,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,“is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.
1401,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,_He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I
1402,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the"
1403,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,"world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and"
1404,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst
1405,THE MAN OF THE CROWD.,sich nicht lesen._’”

1417,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,A Tale With a Moral.
1418,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1419,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las"
1420,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,"
1421,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,"
1422,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure"
1423,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We"
1424,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be
1425,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there"
1426,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon"
1427,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,"
1428,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every"
1429,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon"
1430,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a"
1431,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that"
1432,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and
1433,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by"
1434,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;"
1435,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch."
1436,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a
1437,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views"
1438,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it"
1439,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound
1440,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for"
1441,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,"
1442,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of
1443,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,"
1444,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”"
1445,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,"
1446,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all
1447,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,come very straight in the end.
1448,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1449,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by"
1450,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in"
1451,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics"
1452,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the"
1453,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them
1454,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by"
1455,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history
1456,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no"
1457,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals"
1458,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this
1459,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who"
1460,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus"
1461,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.
1462,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1463,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"_Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De"
1464,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead
1465,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,"
1466,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad"
1467,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was"
1468,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his
1469,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for
1470,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,"
1471,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the"
1472,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be"
1473,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left"
1474,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a
1475,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an
1476,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks"
1477,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,"
1478,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was"
1479,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my"
1480,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he"
1481,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have
1482,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond"
1483,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,"
1484,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made"
1485,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,prophecy of his ruin.
1486,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1487,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he
1488,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six
1489,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in"
1490,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight
1491,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance
1492,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,"
1493,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing"
1494,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and"
1495,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,for backing his assertions by bets.
1496,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1497,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had"
1498,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with
1499,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to"
1500,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with"
1501,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will
1502,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With
1503,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on
1504,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if
1505,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to
1506,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever"
1507,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty
1508,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a"
1509,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by
1510,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act
1511,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.
1512,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I
1513,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he
1514,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the
1515,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil"
1516,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.
1517,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1518,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of
1519,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and"
1520,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about"
1521,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I"
1522,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a
1523,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you"
1524,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly"
1525,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”"
1526,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1527,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1528,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it
1529,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.
1530,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have"
1531,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure
1532,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in
1533,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a"
1534,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which
1535,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.
1536,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to"
1537,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of"
1538,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always
1539,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a
1540,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something"
1541,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his
1542,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which
1543,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something"
1544,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to"
1545,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant"
1546,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical."
1547,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I
1548,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve
1549,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the"
1550,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I"
1551,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to
1552,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at
1553,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,expostulation.
1554,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1555,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some"
1556,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely"
1557,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to
1558,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out"
1559,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with
1560,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut
1561,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became
1562,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his"
1563,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of"
1564,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply."
1565,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1566,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to
1567,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all
1568,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still
1569,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?
1570,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in"
1571,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this"
1572,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself"
1573,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother
1574,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be"
1575,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.
1576,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1577,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left"
1578,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he
1579,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For
1580,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won
1581,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my"
1582,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.
1583,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1584,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans
1585,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I
1586,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,"
1587,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of"
1588,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my"
1589,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I"
1590,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up"
1591,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less
1592,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself
1593,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so"
1594,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.
1595,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1596,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us"
1597,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross"
1598,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the"
1599,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we"
1600,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the"
1601,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the
1602,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped."
1603,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so
1604,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not
1605,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well
1606,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with"
1607,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of
1608,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain"
1609,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,"
1610,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve
1611,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came
1612,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd"
1613,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the"
1614,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.
1615,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the"
1616,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile"
1617,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as"
1618,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted
1619,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the"
1620,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The"
1621,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and"
1622,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by"
1623,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a"
1624,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be"
1625,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his
1626,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,head that he could.
1627,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1628,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some"
1629,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a"
1630,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I"
1631,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a"
1632,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a"
1633,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more
1634,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of
1635,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly"
1636,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a"
1637,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and"
1638,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.
1639,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1640,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk"
1641,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very
1642,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a"
1643,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”"
1644,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1645,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1646,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,"
1647,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a
1648,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,"
1649,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance."
1650,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1651,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman"
1652,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;
1653,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is"
1654,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is"
1655,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,pretty sure to look like a fool.
1656,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1657,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,"
1658,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I"
1659,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”
1660,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1661,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1662,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not
1663,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our
1664,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own
1665,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or"
1666,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could"
1667,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those
1668,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the"
1669,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,gentleman says ‘ahem!’”
1670,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1671,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1672,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a"
1673,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you"
1674,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may"
1675,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”"
1676,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1677,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1678,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.
1679,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a"
1680,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all"
1681,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated
1682,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.
1683,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1684,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of"
1685,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of"
1686,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,mere form.”
1687,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1688,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1689,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a"
1690,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable"
1691,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down
1692,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a"
1693,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say
1694,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this"
1695,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt"
1696,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme
1697,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable
1698,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him
1699,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”"
1700,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1701,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1702,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and"
1703,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,looking like a very old sheep in a revery.
1704,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1705,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade"
1706,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”"
1707,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait"
1708,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go"
1709,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of"
1710,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and"
1711,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by"
1712,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up"
1713,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his"
1714,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as"
1715,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,agreed upon—
1716,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1717,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1718,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,_One—two—three—and—away!_
1719,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1720,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1721,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop."
1722,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like"
1723,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would"
1724,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what"
1725,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any"
1726,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he
1727,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the"
1728,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very"
1729,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all"
1730,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when
1731,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,I uttered the four last words of my remark.
1732,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1733,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an"
1734,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had"
1735,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of"
1736,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up."
1737,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the"
1738,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing
1739,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of
1740,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,"
1741,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the"
1742,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old
1743,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up"
1744,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the
1745,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had
1746,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded"
1747,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my"
1748,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might
1749,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his"
1750,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I"
1751,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the
1752,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the"
1753,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just"
1754,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so"
1755,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its"
1756,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to"
1757,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this
1758,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come
1759,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,precisely in contact.
1760,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1761,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give
1762,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated"
1763,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all"
1764,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister"
1765,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,"
1766,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels
1767,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,"refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for"
1768,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,dog’s meat.
1769,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,
1770,NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD,

1773,THOU ART THE MAN,THOU ART THE MAN
1774,THOU ART THE MAN,
1775,THOU ART THE MAN,
1776,THOU ART THE MAN,I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to
1777,THOU ART THE MAN,you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected
1778,THOU ART THE MAN,"the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the"
1779,THOU ART THE MAN,"undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to"
1780,THOU ART THE MAN,infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the
1781,THOU ART THE MAN,grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.
1782,THOU ART THE MAN,
1783,THOU ART THE MAN,This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of
1784,THOU ART THE MAN,unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas
1785,THOU ART THE MAN,Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of
1786,THOU ART THE MAN,the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances
1787,THOU ART THE MAN,which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out
1788,THOU ART THE MAN,"from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the"
1789,THOU ART THE MAN,"avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles"
1790,THOU ART THE MAN,"distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his"
1791,THOU ART THE MAN,"departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the"
1792,THOU ART THE MAN,saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal
1793,THOU ART THE MAN,"was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave"
1794,THOU ART THE MAN,rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was
1795,THOU ART THE MAN,"found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the"
1796,THOU ART THE MAN,whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.
1797,THOU ART THE MAN,
1798,THOU ART THE MAN,The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom
1799,THOU ART THE MAN,"friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was"
1800,THOU ART THE MAN,"universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”"
1801,THOU ART THE MAN,"Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the"
1802,THOU ART THE MAN,"name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never"
1803,THOU ART THE MAN,"yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there"
1804,THOU ART THE MAN,"never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,"
1805,THOU ART THE MAN,"good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did"
1806,THOU ART THE MAN,"you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the"
1807,THOU ART THE MAN,"face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of"
1808,THOU ART THE MAN,"no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the"
1809,THOU ART THE MAN,"hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be"
1810,THOU ART THE MAN,called Charles.
1811,THOU ART THE MAN,
1812,THOU ART THE MAN,"Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not"
1813,THOU ART THE MAN,"longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing"
1814,THOU ART THE MAN,"about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no"
1815,THOU ART THE MAN,difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable
1816,THOU ART THE MAN,people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare
1817,THOU ART THE MAN,"word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no"
1818,THOU ART THE MAN,saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of
1819,THOU ART THE MAN,"his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,"
1820,THOU ART THE MAN,that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of
1821,THOU ART THE MAN,recommendation.”
1822,THOU ART THE MAN,
1823,THOU ART THE MAN,
1824,THOU ART THE MAN,I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable
1825,THOU ART THE MAN,"and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old"
1826,THOU ART THE MAN,Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been
1827,THOU ART THE MAN,"his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,"
1828,THOU ART THE MAN,"although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and"
1829,THOU ART THE MAN,"never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent"
1830,THOU ART THE MAN,"the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;"
1831,THOU ART THE MAN,for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four
1832,THOU ART THE MAN,"times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to"
1833,THOU ART THE MAN,"breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine"
1834,THOU ART THE MAN,"that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be"
1835,THOU ART THE MAN,a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was
1836,THOU ART THE MAN,"Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to"
1837,THOU ART THE MAN,"see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one"
1838,THOU ART THE MAN,"day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat"
1839,THOU ART THE MAN,"out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell"
1840,THOU ART THE MAN,"you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old"
1841,THOU ART THE MAN,"fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to"
1842,THOU ART THE MAN,"guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make"
1843,THOU ART THE MAN,"thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr."
1844,THOU ART THE MAN,"Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond"
1845,THOU ART THE MAN,"“Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”"
1846,THOU ART THE MAN,"says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a"
1847,THOU ART THE MAN,"double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,"
1848,THOU ART THE MAN,"I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and"
1849,THOU ART THE MAN,there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some
1850,THOU ART THE MAN,"of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I"
1851,THOU ART THE MAN,"mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,"
1852,THOU ART THE MAN,just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed
1853,THOU ART THE MAN,between the two friends.
1854,THOU ART THE MAN,
1855,THOU ART THE MAN,"Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly"
1856,THOU ART THE MAN,"understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any"
1857,THOU ART THE MAN,one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first
1858,THOU ART THE MAN,"heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his"
1859,THOU ART THE MAN,"master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone"
1860,THOU ART THE MAN,clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing
1861,THOU ART THE MAN,"him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had"
1862,THOU ART THE MAN,"been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if"
1863,THOU ART THE MAN,he had had a fit of the ague.
1864,THOU ART THE MAN,
1865,THOU ART THE MAN,At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing
1866,THOU ART THE MAN,"at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he"
1867,THOU ART THE MAN,endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a
1868,THOU ART THE MAN,"stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a"
1869,THOU ART THE MAN,"week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn"
1870,THOU ART THE MAN,"up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain"
1871,THOU ART THE MAN,his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often
1872,THOU ART THE MAN,"observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who"
1873,THOU ART THE MAN,are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to
1874,THOU ART THE MAN,"be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,"
1875,THOU ART THE MAN,and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse
1876,THOU ART THE MAN,"their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate"
1877,THOU ART THE MAN,over the trouble.
1878,THOU ART THE MAN,
1879,THOU ART THE MAN,"The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom"
1880,THOU ART THE MAN,"and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt"
1881,THOU ART THE MAN,"disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until"
1882,THOU ART THE MAN,"something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I"
1883,THOU ART THE MAN,"believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,"
1884,THOU ART THE MAN,"but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a"
1885,THOU ART THE MAN,"young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad"
1886,THOU ART THE MAN,"character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to"
1887,THOU ART THE MAN,"nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon"
1888,THOU ART THE MAN,making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This
1889,THOU ART THE MAN,was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the
1890,THOU ART THE MAN,"time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of"
1891,THOU ART THE MAN,"“Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the"
1892,THOU ART THE MAN,"party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr."
1893,THOU ART THE MAN,Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances
1894,THOU ART THE MAN,"connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to"
1895,THOU ART THE MAN,"assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered"
1896,THOU ART THE MAN,man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various
1897,THOU ART THE MAN,"members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr."
1898,THOU ART THE MAN,"Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no"
1899,THOU ART THE MAN,"means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for"
1900,THOU ART THE MAN,the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.
1901,THOU ART THE MAN,Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged
1902,THOU ART THE MAN,"excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which"
1903,THOU ART THE MAN,the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have
1904,THOU ART THE MAN,behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the
1905,THOU ART THE MAN,"blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely"
1906,THOU ART THE MAN,muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first
1907,THOU ART THE MAN,"convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition"
1908,THOU ART THE MAN,"of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner"
1909,THOU ART THE MAN,given vent to than forgotten.
1910,THOU ART THE MAN,
1911,THOU ART THE MAN,However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at
1912,THOU ART THE MAN,"issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally"
1913,THOU ART THE MAN,"through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the"
1914,THOU ART THE MAN,determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the
1915,THOU ART THE MAN,missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the
1916,THOU ART THE MAN,first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be
1917,THOU ART THE MAN,"made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should"
1918,THOU ART THE MAN,"disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for"
1919,THOU ART THE MAN,"the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,"
1920,THOU ART THE MAN,"however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”"
1921,THOU ART THE MAN,finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan
1922,THOU ART THE MAN,"that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr."
1923,THOU ART THE MAN,"Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be"
1924,THOU ART THE MAN,"instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old"
1925,THOU ART THE MAN,Charley” himself leading the way.
1926,THOU ART THE MAN,
1927,THOU ART THE MAN,"As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than"
1928,THOU ART THE MAN,"“Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,"
1929,THOU ART THE MAN,"although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,"
1930,THOU ART THE MAN,"by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,"
1931,THOU ART THE MAN,and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a
1932,THOU ART THE MAN,"week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say"
1933,THOU ART THE MAN,"no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,"
1934,THOU ART THE MAN,"to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,"
1935,THOU ART THE MAN,"by his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to"
1936,THOU ART THE MAN,"the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the"
1937,THOU ART THE MAN,track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path
1938,THOU ART THE MAN,"coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of"
1939,THOU ART THE MAN,"the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party"
1940,THOU ART THE MAN,"came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,"
1941,THOU ART THE MAN,"to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track"
1942,THOU ART THE MAN,"was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature"
1943,THOU ART THE MAN,"had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much"
1944,THOU ART THE MAN,"larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the"
1945,THOU ART THE MAN,"pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and"
1946,THOU ART THE MAN,"the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any"
1947,THOU ART THE MAN,"result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of"
1948,THOU ART THE MAN,"draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,"
1949,THOU ART THE MAN,and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and
1950,THOU ART THE MAN,"consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,"
1951,THOU ART THE MAN,"supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,"
1952,THOU ART THE MAN,the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom
1953,THOU ART THE MAN,"visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered"
1954,THOU ART THE MAN,"a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately"
1955,THOU ART THE MAN,recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much
1956,THOU ART THE MAN,"torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the"
1957,THOU ART THE MAN,party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner
1958,THOU ART THE MAN,on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while
1959,THOU ART THE MAN,"there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that"
1960,THOU ART THE MAN,Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the
1961,THOU ART THE MAN,"remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he"
1962,THOU ART THE MAN,had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.
1963,THOU ART THE MAN,Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.
1964,THOU ART THE MAN,
1965,THOU ART THE MAN,"Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was"
1966,THOU ART THE MAN,"observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were"
1967,THOU ART THE MAN,"excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he"
1968,THOU ART THE MAN,"had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,"
1969,THOU ART THE MAN,the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at
1970,THOU ART THE MAN,"once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed"
1971,THOU ART THE MAN,"enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the"
1972,THOU ART THE MAN,magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant
1973,THOU ART THE MAN,lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of
1974,THOU ART THE MAN,"Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere"
1975,THOU ART THE MAN,forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.
1976,THOU ART THE MAN,"Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,"
1977,THOU ART THE MAN,"no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr."
1978,THOU ART THE MAN,"Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of"
1979,THOU ART THE MAN,"his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the"
1980,THOU ART THE MAN,"suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really"
1981,THOU ART THE MAN,"had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every"
1982,THOU ART THE MAN,"exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his"
1983,THOU ART THE MAN,"possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could"
1984,THOU ART THE MAN,"conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly"
1985,THOU ART THE MAN,perplexing piece of business.”
1986,THOU ART THE MAN,
1987,THOU ART THE MAN,
1988,THOU ART THE MAN,"Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much"
1989,THOU ART THE MAN,to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted
1990,THOU ART THE MAN,people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all
1991,THOU ART THE MAN,"sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the"
1992,THOU ART THE MAN,"hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the"
1993,THOU ART THE MAN,"kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his"
1994,THOU ART THE MAN,cause than to advance it.
1995,THOU ART THE MAN,
1996,THOU ART THE MAN,"So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old"
1997,THOU ART THE MAN,"Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,"
1998,THOU ART THE MAN,"yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of"
1999,THOU ART THE MAN,which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in
2000,THOU ART THE MAN,"the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion"
2001,THOU ART THE MAN,"already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse"
2002,THOU ART THE MAN,against him the fury of the mob.
2003,THOU ART THE MAN,
2004,THOU ART THE MAN,One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his
2005,THOU ART THE MAN,allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.
2006,THOU ART THE MAN,Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They
2007,THOU ART THE MAN,had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or
2008,THOU ART THE MAN,two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the
2009,THOU ART THE MAN,"nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance"
2010,THOU ART THE MAN,as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were
2011,THOU ART THE MAN,the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once
2012,THOU ART THE MAN,"to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the"
2013,THOU ART THE MAN,possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And
2014,THOU ART THE MAN,"straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a"
2015,THOU ART THE MAN,question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible
2016,THOU ART THE MAN,"crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me"
2017,THOU ART THE MAN,to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and
2018,THOU ART THE MAN,"simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and"
2019,THOU ART THE MAN,"misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in"
2020,THOU ART THE MAN,"those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who"
2021,THOU ART THE MAN,"quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her"
2022,THOU ART THE MAN,"learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in"
2023,THOU ART THE MAN,"all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of"
2024,THOU ART THE MAN,"Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little"
2025,THOU ART THE MAN,"Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)"
2026,THOU ART THE MAN,"“to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose"
2027,THOU ART THE MAN,"advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal"
2028,THOU ART THE MAN,"phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under"
2029,THOU ART THE MAN,"consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the"
2030,THOU ART THE MAN,probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the
2031,THOU ART THE MAN,"deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?"
2032,THOU ART THE MAN,"very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,"
2033,THOU ART THE MAN,"after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had"
2034,THOU ART THE MAN,"not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been"
2035,THOU ART THE MAN,"altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the"
2036,THOU ART THE MAN,part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and
2037,THOU ART THE MAN,even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the
2038,THOU ART THE MAN,"good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat"
2039,THOU ART THE MAN,"to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once"
2040,THOU ART THE MAN,"the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,"
2041,THOU ART THE MAN,"very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle."
2042,THOU ART THE MAN,
2043,THOU ART THE MAN,"Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,"
2044,THOU ART THE MAN,"after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On"
2045,THOU ART THE MAN,"the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the"
2046,THOU ART THE MAN,"suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a"
2047,THOU ART THE MAN,"little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few"
2048,THOU ART THE MAN,"paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the"
2049,THOU ART THE MAN,"grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of"
2050,THOU ART THE MAN,half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was
2051,THOU ART THE MAN,"noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up"
2052,THOU ART THE MAN,was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized
2053,THOU ART THE MAN,"as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved"
2054,THOU ART THE MAN,upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.
2055,THOU ART THE MAN,
2056,THOU ART THE MAN,"No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon"
2057,THOU ART THE MAN,reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.
2058,THOU ART THE MAN,
2059,THOU ART THE MAN,"Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being"
2060,THOU ART THE MAN,questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s
2061,THOU ART THE MAN,"disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that"
2062,THOU ART THE MAN,"very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the"
2063,THOU ART THE MAN,immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had
2064,THOU ART THE MAN,been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.
2065,THOU ART THE MAN,
2066,THOU ART THE MAN,"This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked"
2067,THOU ART THE MAN,permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed
2068,THOU ART THE MAN,"his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to"
2069,THOU ART THE MAN,"remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man"
2070,THOU ART THE MAN,"(notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)"
2071,THOU ART THE MAN,"had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,"
2072,THOU ART THE MAN,by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the
2073,THOU ART THE MAN,"circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these"
2074,THOU ART THE MAN,circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he
2075,THOU ART THE MAN,"would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his"
2076,THOU ART THE MAN,heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He
2077,THOU ART THE MAN,"then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr."
2078,THOU ART THE MAN,"Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had"
2079,THOU ART THE MAN,"mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his"
2080,THOU ART THE MAN,object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an
2081,THOU ART THE MAN,"unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and"
2082,THOU ART THE MAN,"that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to"
2083,THOU ART THE MAN,the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will
2084,THOU ART THE MAN,"originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)"
2085,THOU ART THE MAN,now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the
2086,THOU ART THE MAN,witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial
2087,THOU ART THE MAN,"particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr."
2088,THOU ART THE MAN,Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.
2089,THOU ART THE MAN,
2090,THOU ART THE MAN,The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables
2091,THOU ART THE MAN,to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this
2092,THOU ART THE MAN,"search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,"
2093,THOU ART THE MAN,russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit
2094,THOU ART THE MAN,"of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been"
2095,THOU ART THE MAN,"abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the"
2096,THOU ART THE MAN,"prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their"
2097,THOU ART THE MAN,"concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter."
2098,THOU ART THE MAN,"The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the"
2099,THOU ART THE MAN,"unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials"
2100,THOU ART THE MAN,"of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim."
2101,THOU ART THE MAN,
2102,THOU ART THE MAN,"At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had"
2103,THOU ART THE MAN,"just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,"
2104,THOU ART THE MAN,and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of
2105,THOU ART THE MAN,"the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of"
2106,THOU ART THE MAN,"discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate"
2107,THOU ART THE MAN,"beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after"
2108,THOU ART THE MAN,considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect
2109,THOU ART THE MAN,"and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,"
2110,THOU ART THE MAN,"was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,"
2111,THOU ART THE MAN,while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or
2112,THOU ART THE MAN,"its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet"
2113,THOU ART THE MAN,"was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,"
2114,THOU ART THE MAN,"and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental"
2115,THOU ART THE MAN,ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself
2116,THOU ART THE MAN,"to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining"
2117,THOU ART THE MAN,"magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately"
2118,THOU ART THE MAN,committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in
2119,THOU ART THE MAN,"the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly"
2120,THOU ART THE MAN,"remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be"
2121,THOU ART THE MAN,required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in
2122,THOU ART THE MAN,accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct
2123,THOU ART THE MAN,during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the
2124,THOU ART THE MAN,present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the
2125,THOU ART THE MAN,"excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,"
2126,THOU ART THE MAN,"when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr."
2127,THOU ART THE MAN,Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the
2128,THOU ART THE MAN,face of the earth.
2129,THOU ART THE MAN,
2130,THOU ART THE MAN,"The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,"
2131,THOU ART THE MAN,"amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at"
2132,THOU ART THE MAN,"the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence"
2133,THOU ART THE MAN,"(strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr."
2134,THOU ART THE MAN,Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the
2135,THOU ART THE MAN,"court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the"
2136,THOU ART THE MAN,"jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of"
2137,THOU ART THE MAN,“Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch
2138,THOU ART THE MAN,"received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await"
2139,THOU ART THE MAN,the inexorable vengeance of the law.
2140,THOU ART THE MAN,
2141,THOU ART THE MAN,"In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had"
2142,THOU ART THE MAN,doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten
2143,THOU ART THE MAN,"times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the"
2144,THOU ART THE MAN,"hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,"
2145,THOU ART THE MAN,the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled
2146,THOU ART THE MAN,"him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,"
2147,THOU ART THE MAN,"when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the"
2148,THOU ART THE MAN,occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended
2149,THOU ART THE MAN,over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.
2150,THOU ART THE MAN,
2151,THOU ART THE MAN,"One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at"
2152,THOU ART THE MAN,the receipt of the following letter:

2178,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2179,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2180,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr."
2181,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised"
2182,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of"
2183,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly
2184,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large"
2185,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of"
2186,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any
2187,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the
2188,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at"
2189,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that
2190,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends
2191,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich"
2192,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and"
2193,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled
2194,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to
2195,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I"
2196,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he"
2197,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt."
2198,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2199,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly"
2200,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough"
2201,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the"
2202,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late"
2203,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been"
2204,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a"
2205,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were"
2206,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be"
2207,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.
2208,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2209,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had"
2210,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a"
2211,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty"
2212,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with"
2213,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously"
2214,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during"
2215,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”
2216,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2217,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2218,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very"
2219,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued."
2220,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with"
2221,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few"
2222,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at"
2223,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing"
2224,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered"
2225,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and"
2226,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the"
2227,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and"
2228,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over"
2229,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs"
2230,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",quiveringly upon the table.
2231,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2232,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the
2233,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the"
2234,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,"
2235,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If"
2236,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony"
2237,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with"
2238,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of
2239,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be"
2240,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,"
2241,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out
2242,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his"
2243,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and"
2244,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed"
2245,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then
2246,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",imprisoned and doomed to die.
2247,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2248,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to
2249,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched
2250,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,"
2251,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by"
2252,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and"
2253,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through
2254,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",the woods.
2255,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2256,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by"
2257,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr."
2258,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained
2259,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",handkerchief and shirt.
2260,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2261,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty
2262,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he"
2263,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—_dead_."
2264,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2265,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2266,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although"
2267,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had"
2268,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when"
2269,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then"
2270,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat"
2271,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared"
2272,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from
2273,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw
2274,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or"
2275,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the"
2276,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in"
2277,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers"
2278,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and"
2279,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after"
2280,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by"
2281,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the
2282,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be
2283,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and"
2284,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.
2285,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong"
2286,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",because I kept it altogether to myself.
2287,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2288,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of"
2289,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as"
2290,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his
2291,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry"
2292,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the"
2293,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","bottom, I discovered what I sought."
2294,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2295,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two
2296,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the"
2297,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a
2298,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and"
2299,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body
2300,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press
2301,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I
2302,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top"
2303,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",would fly off and the body up.
2304,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2305,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as"
2306,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants
2307,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to"
2308,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal"
2309,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I"
2310,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I"
2311,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.
2312,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2313,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was
2314,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by"
2315,"“H., F., B., & CO.”","the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever"
2316,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",afterward a new life.
2317,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",
2318,"“H., F., B., & CO.”",

2561,BON-BON.,"in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially"
2562,BON-BON.,undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but
2563,BON-BON.,what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his
2564,BON-BON.,thoughts _sur l’Ame_—his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If
2565,BON-BON.,"his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable,"

2567,BON-BON.,an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash of “_Idées_” of all

2571,BON-BON.,"would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while"

2574,BON-BON.,"depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no"
2575,BON-BON.,"means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were"
2576,BON-BON.,"difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their"
2577,BON-BON.,self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is
2578,BON-BON.,to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that
2579,BON-BON.,Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed

2583,BON-BON.,"the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the"
2584,BON-BON.,obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was
2585,BON-BON.,Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_—He
2586,BON-BON.,reasoned also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate—or
2587,BON-BON.,otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in
2588,BON-BON.,Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.

2590,BON-BON.,I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I
2591,BON-BON.,"would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling"
2592,BON-BON.,"his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of"
2593,BON-BON.,their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in
2594,BON-BON.,which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion
2595,BON-BON.,the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities
2596,BON-BON.,"of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the"
2597,BON-BON.,"Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all"
2598,BON-BON.,"events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind"
2599,BON-BON.,and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of
2600,BON-BON.,"gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the"
2601,BON-BON.,metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man
2602,BON-BON.,"has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they"
2603,BON-BON.,"were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in"
2604,BON-BON.,"other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues."
2605,BON-BON.,"As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in"
2606,BON-BON.,this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto
2607,BON-BON.,relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general
2608,BON-BON.,disposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.
2609,BON-BON.,
2610,{*1} MD,{*1} MD
2611,{*1} MD,
2612,{*1} MD,Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the
2613,{*1} MD,"satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own"
2614,{*1} MD,proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any
2615,{*1} MD,"kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile"
2616,{*1} MD,"was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a"
2617,{*1} MD,knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.
2618,{*1} MD,
2619,{*1} MD,At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the
2620,{*1} MD,"one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the"
2621,{*1} MD,"epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,"
2622,{*1} MD,"there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,"
2623,{*1} MD,"upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ"
2624,{*1} MD,"widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,"
2625,{*1} MD,or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;
2626,{*1} MD,stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at
2627,{*1} MD,"leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague"
2628,{*1} MD,"longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil"
2629,{*1} MD,for wise purposes of his own.
2630,{*1} MD,
2631,{*1} MD,The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy
2632,{*1} MD,"our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary"
2633,{*1} MD,profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether
2634,{*1} MD,"this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such"
2635,{*1} MD,"profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did"
2636,{*1} MD,not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet
2637,{*1} MD,"in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be"
2638,{*1} MD,supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive
2639,{*1} MD,"discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,"
2640,{*1} MD,his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had
2641,{*1} MD,"its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du"
2642,{*1} MD,Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would
2643,{*1} MD,"sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over"
2644,{*1} MD,"Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had"
2645,{*1} MD,it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the
2646,{*1} MD,peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by
2647,{*1} MD,"no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the"
2648,{*1} MD,philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange
2649,{*1} MD,"intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie"
2650,{*1} MD,of his favorite German studies.
2651,{*1} MD,
2652,{*1} MD,"To enter the little _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was, at the period of"
2653,{*1} MD,"our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of"
2654,{*1} MD,"genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told"
2655,{*1} MD,"you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore"
2656,{*1} MD,to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large
2657,{*1} MD,"water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his"
2658,{*1} MD,"master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a"
2659,{*1} MD,"debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether"
2660,{*1} MD,"unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect"
2661,{*1} MD,might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the
2662,{*1} MD,"metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,"
2663,{*1} MD,have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the
2664,{*1} MD,outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of
2665,{*1} MD,the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the
2666,{*1} MD,little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which
2667,{*1} MD,mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in
2668,{*1} MD,"creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his"
2669,{*1} MD,"head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the"
2670,{*1} MD,rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering
2671,{*1} MD,upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of
2672,{*1} MD,his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his
2673,{*1} MD,immortal soul.
2674,{*1} MD,
2675,{*1} MD,I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of
2676,{*1} MD,"habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I"
2677,{*1} MD,"might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over"
2678,{*1} MD,"his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and"
2679,{*1} MD,tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those
2680,{*1} MD,worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the
2681,{*1} MD,sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that
2682,{*1} MD,"the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with"
2683,{*1} MD,"cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more"
2684,{*1} MD,fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his
2685,{*1} MD,"slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been"
2686,{*1} MD,"manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the"
2687,{*1} MD,brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were
2688,{*1} MD,of the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue
2689,{*1} MD,"cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all"
2690,{*1} MD,"over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a"
2691,{*1} MD,mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the
2692,{*1} MD,"remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it"
2693,{*1} MD,"was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,"
2694,{*1} MD,"or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon"
2695,{*1} MD,"all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal"
2696,{*1} MD,"details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the"
2697,{*1} MD,moral dignity of matter-of-fact.
2698,{*1} MD,
2699,{*1} MD,I have said that “to enter the _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was to
2700,{*1} MD,enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man
2701,{*1} MD,"of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the _sanctum_. A sign,"
2702,{*1} MD,"consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the"
2703,{*1} MD,volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a _paté_. On the back were
2704,{*1} MD,visible in large letters _Œuvres de Bon-Bon_. Thus was delicately shadowed
2705,{*1} MD,forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.
2706,{*1} MD,
2707,{*1} MD,"Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building"
2708,{*1} MD,"presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique"
2709,{*1} MD,"construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the _café_. In a"
2710,{*1} MD,corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of
2711,{*1} MD,"curtains, together with a canopy _à la Grècque_, gave it an air at once"
2712,{*1} MD,"classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in"
2713,{*1} MD,"direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the"
2714,{*1} MD,_bibliotheque_. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here
2715,{*1} MD,lay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo
2716,{*1} MD,_mélanges_. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a
2717,{*1} MD,toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato
2718,{*1} MD,reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts
2719,{*1} MD,were filed away upon the spit.
2720,{*1} MD,
2721,{*1} MD,In other respects the _Café de Bon-Bon_ might be said to differ little from
2722,{*1} MD,the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.
2723,{*1} MD,On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable
2724,{*1} MD,array of labelled bottles.
2725,{*1} MD,
2726,{*1} MD,"It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe"
2727,{*1} MD,"winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to"
2728,{*1} MD,the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that
2729,{*1} MD,"Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked"
2730,{*1} MD,"the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific"
2731,{*1} MD,"mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of"
2732,{*1} MD,blazing fagots.
2733,{*1} MD,
2734,{*1} MD,It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice
2735,{*1} MD,"during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre"
2736,{*1} MD,"with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,"
2737,{*1} MD,"and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of"
2738,{*1} MD,"the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and"
2739,{*1} MD,"papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the"
2740,{*1} MD,"tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its"
2741,{*1} MD,stanchions of solid oak.
2742,{*1} MD,
2743,{*1} MD,"It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his"
2744,{*1} MD,chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a
2745,{*1} MD,"perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of"
2746,{*1} MD,"his meditations. In attempting _des oeufs à la Princesse_, he had"
2747,{*1} MD,unfortunately perpetrated an _omelette à la Reine;_ the discovery of a
2748,{*1} MD,principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and
2749,{*1} MD,"last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains"
2750,{*1} MD,which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a
2751,{*1} MD,successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these
2752,{*1} MD,"unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree"
2753,{*1} MD,of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well
2754,{*1} MD,calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large
2755,{*1} MD,"black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in"
2756,{*1} MD,"his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those"
2757,{*1} MD,distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the
2758,{*1} MD,red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.
2759,{*1} MD,Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible
2760,{*1} MD,"to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and"
2761,{*1} MD,"papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous"
2762,{*1} MD,"manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow."
2763,{*1} MD,
2764,{*1} MD,"He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,"
2765,{*1} MD,"Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment."
2766,{*1} MD,
2767,{*1} MD,"“The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the"
2768,{*1} MD,"table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment."
2769,{*1} MD,
2770,{*1} MD,"“Very true,” calmly replied the voice."
2771,{*1} MD,
2772,{*1} MD,“Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated
2773,{*1} MD,"the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at"
2774,{*1} MD,full length upon the bed.
2775,{*1} MD,
2776,{*1} MD,"“I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the"
2777,{*1} MD,"interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that"
2778,{*1} MD,"the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing"
2779,{*1} MD,"importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have"
2780,{*1} MD,finished your Exposition.”
2781,{*1} MD,
2782,{*1} MD,
2783,{*1} MD,“My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you
2784,{*1} MD,to understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”
2785,{*1} MD,
2786,{*1} MD,
2787,{*1} MD,"“Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly"
2788,{*1} MD,"from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp"
2789,{*1} MD,that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.
2790,{*1} MD,
2791,{*1} MD,The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the
2792,{*1} MD,"stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly"
2793,{*1} MD,"lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,"
2794,{*1} MD,"by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,"
2795,{*1} MD,but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These
2796,{*1} MD,garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their
2797,{*1} MD,present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.
2798,{*1} MD,"In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to"
2799,{*1} MD,the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head
2800,{*1} MD,"was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from"
2801,{*1} MD,"which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,"
2802,{*1} MD,"with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and"
2803,{*1} MD,at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color
2804,{*1} MD,or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a
2805,{*1} MD,"shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme"
2806,{*1} MD,precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by
2807,{*1} MD,side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an
2808,{*1} MD,"ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and"
2809,{*1} MD,demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over
2810,{*1} MD,"his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an"
2811,{*1} MD,instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of
2812,{*1} MD,his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps
2813,{*1} MD,"of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly"
2814,{*1} MD,from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white
2815,{*1} MD,letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even
2816,{*1} MD,"cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the"
2817,{*1} MD,ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an
2818,{*1} MD,expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of
2819,{*1} MD,"the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and"
2820,{*1} MD,altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be
2821,{*1} MD,unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the
2822,{*1} MD,"countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory"
2823,{*1} MD,"survey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and"
2824,{*1} MD,conducted him to a seat.
2825,{*1} MD,
2826,{*1} MD,There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous
2827,{*1} MD,"transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which"
2828,{*1} MD,"might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre"
2829,{*1} MD,"Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was"
2830,{*1} MD,of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of
2831,{*1} MD,exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men
2832,{*1} MD,"and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real"
2833,{*1} MD,character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To
2834,{*1} MD,"say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently"
2835,{*1} MD,remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall
2836,{*1} MD,hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his
2837,{*1} MD,breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.
2838,{*1} MD,"Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself"
2839,{*1} MD,thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all
2840,{*1} MD,"times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much"
2841,{*1} MD,of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in
2842,{*1} MD,regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all
2843,{*1} MD,"conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading"
2844,{*1} MD,"his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,"
2845,{*1} MD,"which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,"
2846,{*1} MD,"enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas"
2847,{*1} MD,"which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known"
2848,{*1} MD,"proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to"
2849,{*1} MD,afford.
2850,{*1} MD,
2851,{*1} MD,"Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,"
2852,{*1} MD,"while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and"
2853,{*1} MD,place upon the now re-established table some bottles of _Mousseux_. Having
2854,{*1} MD,"quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair _vis-à-vis_ to his"
2855,{*1} MD,"companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But"
2856,{*1} MD,plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of
2857,{*1} MD,their application—and the _restaurateur_ found himself _nonplussed_ by
2858,{*1} MD,the very first words of his visitor’s speech.
2859,{*1} MD,
2860,{*1} MD,"“I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!"
2861,{*1} MD,"hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping"
2862,{*1} MD,"at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth"
2863,{*1} MD,"from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,"
2864,{*1} MD,"and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and"
2865,{*1} MD,"uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,"
2866,{*1} MD,"joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,"
2867,{*1} MD,"stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment."
2868,{*1} MD,
2869,{*1} MD,Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh
2870,{*1} MD,"like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the"
2871,{*1} MD,"cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white"
2872,{*1} MD,letters which formed the words “_Rituel Catholique_” on the book in his
2873,{*1} MD,"guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and"
2874,{*1} MD,"in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words _Régitre des"
2875,{*1} MD,"Condamnes_ blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,"
2876,{*1} MD,"when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an"
2877,{*1} MD,"air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been"
2878,{*1} MD,observed.
2879,{*1} MD,
2880,{*1} MD,"“Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak"
2881,{*1} MD,sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the
2882,{*1} MD,"d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I"
2883,{*1} MD,_have_ some faint—some _very_ faint idea—of the
2884,{*1} MD,remarkable honor—”
2885,{*1} MD,
2886,{*1} MD,
2887,{*1} MD,“Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say
2888,{*1} MD,"no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green"
2889,{*1} MD,"spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,"
2890,{*1} MD,and deposited them in his pocket.
2891,{*1} MD,
2892,{*1} MD,"If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement"
2893,{*1} MD,was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to
2894,{*1} MD,"view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain"
2895,{*1} MD,"the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had"
2896,{*1} MD,"anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet"
2897,{*1} MD,hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor
2898,{*1} MD,"white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or"
2899,{*1} MD,"in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre"
2900,{*1} MD,"Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but"
2901,{*1} MD,could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous
2902,{*1} MD,"period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am"
2903,{*1} MD,"constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh."
2904,{*1} MD,
2905,{*1} MD,It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some
2906,{*1} MD,"inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his"
2907,{*1} MD,"Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory."
2908,{*1} MD,
2909,{*1} MD,“Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I
2910,{*1} MD,"perceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given"
2911,{*1} MD,"you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre"
2912,{*1} MD,"Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is"
2913,{*1} MD,"the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these"
2914,{*1} MD,optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is
2915,{*1} MD,more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a
2916,{*1} MD,"pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you"
2917,{*1} MD,"behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the"
2918,{*1} MD,reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it
2919,{*1} MD,"is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail"
2920,{*1} MD,and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most
2921,{*1} MD,"distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of"
2922,{*1} MD,metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my
2923,{*1} MD,"profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable"
2924,{*1} MD,"at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I"
2925,{*1} MD,"allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use"
2926,{*1} MD,them well;—my vision is the soul.”
2927,{*1} MD,
2928,{*1} MD,
2929,{*1} MD,"Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring"
2930,{*1} MD,"out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and"
2931,{*1} MD,make himself perfectly at home.
2932,{*1} MD,
2933,{*1} MD,"“A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our"
2934,{*1} MD,"friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after"
2935,{*1} MD,a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that
2936,{*1} MD,"of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement"
2937,{*1} MD,"of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your"
2938,{*1} MD,notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most
2939,{*1} MD,"intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,"
2940,{*1} MD,as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth
2941,{*1} MD,"in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure"
2942,{*1} MD,"compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well"
2943,{*1} MD,know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”
2944,{*1} MD,
2945,{*1} MD,
2946,{*1} MD,“Cannot say that I—”
2947,{*1} MD,
2948,{*1} MD,
2949,{*1} MD,"“Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men"
2950,{*1} MD,expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”
2951,{*1} MD,
2952,{*1} MD,
2953,{*1} MD,"“Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the"
2954,{*1} MD,"metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,"
2955,{*1} MD,and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.
2956,{*1} MD,
2957,{*1} MD,"“There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly"
2958,{*1} MD,declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there
2959,{*1} MD,"was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a"
2960,{*1} MD,"friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons."
2961,{*1} MD,"He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was"
2962,{*1} MD,"distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ"
2963,{*1} MD,υοῦς εστιν
2964,{*1} MD,"αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went"
2965,{*1} MD,"home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me"
2966,{*1} MD,"for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to"
2967,{*1} MD,"Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing"
2968,{*1} MD,the ‘αυλος.’
2969,{*1} MD,
2970,{*1} MD,
2971,{*1} MD,"“Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So"
2972,{*1} MD,the sentence now read ‘δ
2973,{*1} MD,υοῦς εστιν
2974,{*1} MD,"αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the"
2975,{*1} MD,fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”
2976,{*1} MD,
2977,{*1} MD,
2978,{*1} MD,"“Were you ever at Rome?” asked the _restaurateur_, as he finished his second"
2979,{*1} MD,"bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of"
2980,{*1} MD,Chambertin.
2981,{*1} MD,
2982,{*1} MD,"“But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,"
2983,{*1} MD,as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when
2984,{*1} MD,"occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of"
2985,{*1} MD,"all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,"
2986,{*1} MD,and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at
2987,{*1} MD,"that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I"
2988,{*1} MD,"have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”"
2989,{*1} MD,(*2)
2990,{*1} MD,
2991,{*1} MD,"{*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,"
2992,{*1} MD,Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—_Condorcet_.
2993,{*1} MD,
2994,{*1} MD,“What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”
2995,{*1} MD,
2996,{*1} MD,
2997,{*1} MD,"“What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot"
2998,{*1} MD,surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!
2999,{*1} MD,"Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who"
3000,{*1} MD,wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes
3001,{*1} MD,Laertes.”
3002,{*1} MD,
3003,{*1} MD,
3004,{*1} MD,"“That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little"
3005,{*1} MD,into his head.
3006,{*1} MD,
3007,{*1} MD,"“Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his"
3008,{*1} MD,"Majesty, apparently much flattered."
3009,{*1} MD,
3010,{*1} MD,"“That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a"
3011,{*1} MD,lie!”
3012,{*1} MD,
3013,{*1} MD,
3014,{*1} MD,"“Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and"
3015,{*1} MD,"Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to"
3016,{*1} MD,conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.
3017,{*1} MD,
3018,{*1} MD,"“As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little"
3019,{*1} MD,"while ago, there are some very _outré_ notions in that book of yours"
3020,{*1} MD,"Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about"
3021,{*1} MD,"the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”"
3022,{*1} MD,
3023,{*1} MD,
3024,{*1} MD,"“The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to"
3025,{*1} MD,"his MS., “is undoubtedly—”"
3026,{*1} MD,
3027,{*1} MD,
3028,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3029,{*1} MD,
3030,{*1} MD,
3031,{*1} MD,“Indubitably—”
3032,{*1} MD,
3033,{*1} MD,
3034,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3035,{*1} MD,
3036,{*1} MD,
3037,{*1} MD,“Indisputably—”
3038,{*1} MD,
3039,{*1} MD,
3040,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3041,{*1} MD,
3042,{*1} MD,
3043,{*1} MD,“Evidently—”
3044,{*1} MD,
3045,{*1} MD,
3046,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3047,{*1} MD,
3048,{*1} MD,
3049,{*1} MD,“Incontrovertibly—”
3050,{*1} MD,
3051,{*1} MD,
3052,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3053,{*1} MD,
3054,{*1} MD,
3055,{*1} MD,“Hiccup!—”
3056,{*1} MD,
3057,{*1} MD,
3058,{*1} MD,"“No, sir!”"
3059,{*1} MD,
3060,{*1} MD,
3061,{*1} MD,"“And beyond all question, a—”"
3062,{*1} MD,
3063,{*1} MD,
3064,{*1} MD,"“No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking"
3065,{*1} MD,"daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle"
3066,{*1} MD,of Chambertin.)
3067,{*1} MD,
3068,{*1} MD,"“Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”"
3069,{*1} MD,
3070,{*1} MD,
3071,{*1} MD,"“That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,"
3072,{*1} MD,"musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad"
3073,{*1} MD,"souls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,"
3074,{*1} MD,"and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,"
3075,{*1} MD,was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.
3076,{*1} MD,
3077,{*1} MD,He continued.
3078,{*1} MD,
3079,{*1} MD,“There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:
3080,{*1} MD,"Plato—exquisite—not _your_ Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your"
3081,{*1} MD,Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me
3082,{*1} MD,"see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then"
3083,{*1} MD,"there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear"
3084,{*1} MD,"Quinty! as I called him when he sung a _seculare_ for my amusement, while I"
3085,{*1} MD,"toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want _flavor_, these"
3086,{*1} MD,"Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will _keep_,"
3087,{*1} MD,which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”
3088,{*1} MD,
3089,{*1} MD,
3090,{*1} MD,Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the _nil admirari_ and endeavored
3091,{*1} MD,"to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a"
3092,{*1} MD,"strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although"
3093,{*1} MD,"extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply"
3094,{*1} MD,"kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:"
3095,{*1} MD,
3096,{*1} MD,“I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am
3097,{*1} MD,"fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to"
3098,{*1} MD,"my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of"
3099,{*1} MD,Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus
3100,{*1} MD,Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”
3101,{*1} MD,
3102,{*1} MD,
3103,{*1} MD,"“Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:"
3104,{*1} MD,
3105,{*1} MD,"“But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it"
3106,{*1} MD,"is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I"
3107,{*1} MD,mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long
3108,{*1} MD,"ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a"
3109,{*1} MD,little rancid on account of the gall!”
3110,{*1} MD,
3111,{*1} MD,
3112,{*1} MD,“Shelled!”
3113,{*1} MD,
3114,{*1} MD,
3115,{*1} MD,“I mean taken out of the carcass.”
3116,{*1} MD,
3117,{*1} MD,
3118,{*1} MD,“What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”
3119,{*1} MD,
3120,{*1} MD,
3121,{*1} MD,“Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched
3122,{*1} MD,violently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt
3123,{*1} MD,of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing
3124,{*1} MD,him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”
3125,{*1} MD,
3126,{*1} MD,
3127,{*1} MD,"“The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion"
3128,{*1} MD,of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.
3129,{*1} MD,
3130,{*1} MD,"“After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a"
3131,{*1} MD,"gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and"
3132,{*1} MD,with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”
3133,{*1} MD,
3134,{*1} MD,
3135,{*1} MD,“How so?”
3136,{*1} MD,
3137,{*1} MD,
3138,{*1} MD,"“Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know"
3139,{*1} MD,"that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep"
3140,{*1} MD,"a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless"
3141,{*1} MD,"pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you"
3142,{*1} MD,"understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls"
3143,{*1} MD,are consigned to us in the usual way.”
3144,{*1} MD,
3145,{*1} MD,
3146,{*1} MD,“Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”
3147,{*1} MD,
3148,{*1} MD,
3149,{*1} MD,"Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the"
3150,{*1} MD,"devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he"
3151,{*1} MD,"recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell"
3152,{*1} MD,"you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”"
3153,{*1} MD,
3154,{*1} MD,
3155,{*1} MD,"The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough"
3156,{*1} MD,"comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued."
3157,{*1} MD,
3158,{*1} MD,"“Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put"
3159,{*1} MD,"up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in"
3160,{*1} MD,which case I find they keep very well.”
3161,{*1} MD,
3162,{*1} MD,
3163,{*1} MD,“But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”
3164,{*1} MD,
3165,{*1} MD,
3166,{*1} MD,"“The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I"
3167,{*1} MD,"perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I"
3168,{*1} MD,"have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties"
3169,{*1} MD,"never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and"
3170,{*1} MD,"Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a"
3171,{*1} MD,"thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the"
3172,{*1} MD,"latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why"
3173,{*1} MD,"isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is"
3174,{*1} MD,"_he_ not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who"
3175,{*1} MD,writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I
3176,{*1} MD,have his agreement in my pocket-book.”
3177,{*1} MD,
3178,{*1} MD,
3179,{*1} MD,"Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number"
3180,{*1} MD,of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters
3181,{*1} MD,"_Machi—Maza—Robesp_—with the words _Caligula, George,"
3182,{*1} MD,"Elizabeth_. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it"
3183,{*1} MD,read aloud the following words:
3184,{*1} MD,
3185,{*1} MD,“In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to
3186,{*1} MD,"specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being"
3187,{*1} MD,"aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this"
3188,{*1} MD,"agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my"
3189,{*1} MD,soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did
3190,{*1} MD,not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)
3191,{*1} MD,
3192,{*1} MD,{*4} Quere-Arouet?
3193,{*1} MD,
3194,{*1} MD,"“A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he"
3195,{*1} MD,"was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;"
3196,{*1} MD,Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed
3197,{*1} MD,shadow!”
3198,{*1} MD,
3199,{*1} MD,
3200,{*1} MD,“_Only_ think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our
3201,{*1} MD,"hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of"
3202,{*1} MD,his Majesty’s discourse.
3203,{*1} MD,
3204,{*1} MD,"“Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!"
3205,{*1} MD,"If _I_ would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! _My_ soul, Mr.—humph!”"
3206,{*1} MD,
3207,{*1} MD,
3208,{*1} MD,"“_Your_ soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”"
3209,{*1} MD,
3210,{*1} MD,
3211,{*1} MD,"“Yes, sir—hiccup!—_my_ soul is—”"
3212,{*1} MD,
3213,{*1} MD,
3214,{*1} MD,"“What, sir?”"
3215,{*1} MD,
3216,{*1} MD,
3217,{*1} MD,"“_No_ shadow, damme!”"
3218,{*1} MD,
3219,{*1} MD,
3220,{*1} MD,“Did you mean to say—”
3221,{*1} MD,
3222,{*1} MD,
3223,{*1} MD,"“Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”"
3224,{*1} MD,
3225,{*1} MD,
3226,{*1} MD,“Did you not intend to assert—”
3227,{*1} MD,
3228,{*1} MD,
3229,{*1} MD,“My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”
3230,{*1} MD,
3231,{*1} MD,
3232,{*1} MD,"“What, sir?”"
3233,{*1} MD,
3234,{*1} MD,
3235,{*1} MD,“Stew.”
3236,{*1} MD,
3237,{*1} MD,
3238,{*1} MD,“Ha!”
3239,{*1} MD,
3240,{*1} MD,
3241,{*1} MD,“Soufflee.”
3242,{*1} MD,
3243,{*1} MD,
3244,{*1} MD,“Eh!”
3245,{*1} MD,
3246,{*1} MD,
3247,{*1} MD,“Fricassee.”
3248,{*1} MD,
3249,{*1} MD,
3250,{*1} MD,“Indeed!”
3251,{*1} MD,
3252,{*1} MD,
3253,{*1} MD,"“Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you"
3254,{*1} MD,have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his
3255,{*1} MD,Majesty upon the back.
3256,{*1} MD,
3257,{*1} MD,"“Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time"
3258,{*1} MD,rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.
3259,{*1} MD,
3260,{*1} MD,"“Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty."
3261,{*1} MD,
3262,{*1} MD,“Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.
3263,{*1} MD,
3264,{*1} MD,“Have no funds on hand.”
3265,{*1} MD,
3266,{*1} MD,
3267,{*1} MD,“What?”
3268,{*1} MD,
3269,{*1} MD,
3270,{*1} MD,"“Besides, very unhandsome in me—”"
3271,{*1} MD,
3272,{*1} MD,
3273,{*1} MD,“Sir!”
3274,{*1} MD,
3275,{*1} MD,
3276,{*1} MD,“To take advantage of—”
3277,{*1} MD,
3278,{*1} MD,
3279,{*1} MD,“Hiccup!”
3280,{*1} MD,
3281,{*1} MD,
3282,{*1} MD,“Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”

3296,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3297,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,The _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much
3298,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy."
3299,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it"
3300,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful
3301,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,of supper and go immediately to bed.
3302,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3303,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than
3304,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there"
3305,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,"
3306,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon"
3307,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"four. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded"
3308,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to"
3309,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,"
3310,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed."
3311,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3312,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the"
3313,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon"
3314,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a"
3315,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,profound slumber forthwith.
3316,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3317,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed
3318,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,"
3319,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once."
3320,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife"
3321,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran"
3322,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,thus:
3323,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3324,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3325,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"“Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive"
3326,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I"
3327,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination"
3328,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,of the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it
3329,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"and open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of"
3330,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven"
3331,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,to-night.
3332,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,
3333,SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.,"“Yours, ever,"
3334,PONNONNER.,PONNONNER.
3335,PONNONNER.,
3336,PONNONNER.,
3337,PONNONNER.,"By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide"
3338,PONNONNER.,"awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing"
3339,PONNONNER.,all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set
3340,PONNONNER.,"off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s."
3341,PONNONNER.,
3342,PONNONNER.,There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me
3343,PONNONNER.,with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and
3344,PONNONNER.,the moment I entered its examination was commenced.
3345,PONNONNER.,
3346,PONNONNER.,"It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur"
3347,PONNONNER.,"Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in"
3348,PONNONNER.,"the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile."
3349,PONNONNER.,"The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban"
3350,PONNONNER.,"sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous"
3351,PONNONNER.,illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from
3352,PONNONNER.,"which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such"
3353,PONNONNER.,illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco
3354,PONNONNER.,"paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich"
3355,PONNONNER.,"patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased."
3356,PONNONNER.,
3357,PONNONNER.,The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same
3358,PONNONNER.,"condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,"
3359,PONNONNER.,"the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,"
3360,PONNONNER.,"subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the"
3361,PONNONNER.,complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely
3362,PONNONNER.,"the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once"
3363,PONNONNER.,that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.
3364,PONNONNER.,
3365,PONNONNER.,"Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet"
3366,PONNONNER.,"long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was"
3367,PONNONNER.,oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be
3368,PONNONNER.,"the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we"
3369,PONNONNER.,"found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_,"
3370,PONNONNER.,"composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,"
3371,PONNONNER.,"representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed"
3372,PONNONNER.,"among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of"
3373,PONNONNER.,"hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the"
3374,PONNONNER.,"departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no"
3375,PONNONNER.,"difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and"
3376,PONNONNER.,represented the word _Allamistakeo_.
3377,PONNONNER.,
3378,PONNONNER.,We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but
3379,PONNONNER.,"having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,"
3380,PONNONNER.,"coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,"
3381,PONNONNER.,but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between
3382,PONNONNER.,"the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the"
3383,PONNONNER.,colors of the interior box.
3384,PONNONNER.,
3385,PONNONNER.,"Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a"
3386,PONNONNER.,"third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no"
3387,PONNONNER.,"particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still"
3388,PONNONNER.,emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the
3389,PONNONNER.,second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting
3390,PONNONNER.,accurately within the other.
3391,PONNONNER.,
3392,PONNONNER.,"Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We"
3393,PONNONNER.,"had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or"
3394,PONNONNER.,"bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,"
3395,PONNONNER.,"made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and"
3396,PONNONNER.,painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various
3397,PONNONNER.,"supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,"
3398,PONNONNER.,"with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as"
3399,PONNONNER.,portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a
3400,PONNONNER.,"columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving"
3401,PONNONNER.,"again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations."
3402,PONNONNER.,
3403,PONNONNER.,"Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,"
3404,PONNONNER.,"diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the"
3405,PONNONNER.,"scarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist"
3406,PONNONNER.,was a similar collar or belt.
3407,PONNONNER.,
3408,PONNONNER.,"Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,"
3409,PONNONNER.,"with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,"
3410,PONNONNER.,"smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes"
3411,PONNONNER.,"(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very"
3412,PONNONNER.,"beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too"
3413,PONNONNER.,determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.
3414,PONNONNER.,
3415,PONNONNER.,"Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the"
3416,PONNONNER.,"embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the"
3417,PONNONNER.,"surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the"
3418,PONNONNER.,"powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums"
3419,PONNONNER.,became apparent.
3420,PONNONNER.,
3421,PONNONNER.,We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which
3422,PONNONNER.,"the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none."
3423,PONNONNER.,No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened
3424,PONNONNER.,mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw
3425,PONNONNER.,through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body
3426,PONNONNER.,"was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,"
3427,PONNONNER.,"when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began."
3428,PONNONNER.,
3429,PONNONNER.,"As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing"
3430,PONNONNER.,"his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two"
3431,PONNONNER.,o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until
3432,PONNONNER.,"the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some"
3433,PONNONNER.,one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.
3434,PONNONNER.,
3435,PONNONNER.,The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old
3436,PONNONNER.,"at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,"
3437,PONNONNER.,and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths
3438,PONNONNER.,"in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither"
3439,PONNONNER.,the Egyptian.
3440,PONNONNER.,
3441,PONNONNER.,It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some
3442,PONNONNER.,portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than
3443,PONNONNER.,"other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,"
3444,PONNONNER.,gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with
3445,PONNONNER.,"the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a"
3446,PONNONNER.,"hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,"
3447,PONNONNER.,"when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there"
3448,PONNONNER.,"immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed"
3449,PONNONNER.,"to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and"
3450,PONNONNER.,"which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far"
3451,PONNONNER.,"covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_"
3452,PONNONNER.,remained visible.
3453,PONNONNER.,
3454,PONNONNER.,"With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately"
3455,PONNONNER.,obvious to all.
3456,PONNONNER.,
3457,PONNONNER.,"I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,"
3458,PONNONNER.,"in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for"
3459,PONNONNER.,"the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of"
3460,PONNONNER.,"the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright"
3461,PONNONNER.,fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.
3462,PONNONNER.,"Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk"
3463,PONNONNER.,"Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his"
3464,PONNONNER.,"way, upon all fours, under the table."
3465,PONNONNER.,
3466,PONNONNER.,"After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter"
3467,PONNONNER.,"of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now"
3468,PONNONNER.,directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over
3469,PONNONNER.,"the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis_, and thus"
3470,PONNONNER.,"got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now"
3471,PONNONNER.,"applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of"
3472,PONNONNER.,"exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to"
3473,PONNONNER.,"bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the"
3474,PONNONNER.,"limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,"
3475,PONNONNER.,"which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a"
3476,PONNONNER.,"catapult, through a window into the street below."
3477,PONNONNER.,
3478,PONNONNER.,We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the
3479,PONNONNER.,"victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in"
3480,PONNONNER.,"an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more"
3481,PONNONNER.,than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with
3482,PONNONNER.,vigor and with zeal.
3483,PONNONNER.,
3484,PONNONNER.,"It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound"
3485,PONNONNER.,"incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,"
3486,PONNONNER.,"laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the"
3487,PONNONNER.,wire.
3488,PONNONNER.,
3489,PONNONNER.,Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the
3490,PONNONNER.,"effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked"
3491,PONNONNER.,"very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in"
3492,PONNONNER.,"the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the"
3493,PONNONNER.,"fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,"
3494,PONNONNER.,"turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very"
3495,PONNONNER.,"capital Egyptian, thus:"
3496,PONNONNER.,
3497,PONNONNER.,"“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at"
3498,PONNONNER.,your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He
3499,PONNONNER.,is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But
3500,PONNONNER.,"you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided"
3501,PONNONNER.,"in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say"
3502,PONNONNER.,"who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I"
3503,PONNONNER.,"think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been"
3504,PONNONNER.,led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did
3505,PONNONNER.,anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your
3506,PONNONNER.,standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to
3507,PONNONNER.,"suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,"
3508,PONNONNER.,"and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to"
3509,PONNONNER.,the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little
3510,PONNONNER.,"villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”"
3511,PONNONNER.,
3512,PONNONNER.,
3513,PONNONNER.,"It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech"
3514,PONNONNER.,"under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into"
3515,PONNONNER.,"violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three"
3516,PONNONNER.,"things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of"
3517,PONNONNER.,"conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at"
3518,PONNONNER.,a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the
3519,PONNONNER.,"other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the"
3520,PONNONNER.,"age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now"
3521,PONNONNER.,usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and
3522,PONNONNER.,"impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly"
3523,PONNONNER.,natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.
3524,PONNONNER.,"However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party"
3525,PONNONNER.,"betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any"
3526,PONNONNER.,thing had gone very especially wrong.
3527,PONNONNER.,
3528,PONNONNER.,"For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,"
3529,PONNONNER.,out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands
3530,PONNONNER.,"into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively"
3531,PONNONNER.,red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar
3532,PONNONNER.,"of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb"
3533,PONNONNER.,into the left corner of his mouth.
3534,PONNONNER.,
3535,PONNONNER.,The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and
3536,PONNONNER.,"at length, with a sneer, said:"
3537,PONNONNER.,
3538,PONNONNER.,"“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or"
3539,PONNONNER.,not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”
3540,PONNONNER.,
3541,PONNONNER.,
3542,PONNONNER.,"Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of"
3543,PONNONNER.,"the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his"
3544,PONNONNER.,left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.
3545,PONNONNER.,
3546,PONNONNER.,"Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly"
3547,PONNONNER.,"to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what"
3548,PONNONNER.,we all meant.
3549,PONNONNER.,
3550,PONNONNER.,"Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the"
3551,PONNONNER.,"deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would"
3552,PONNONNER.,"afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his"
3553,PONNONNER.,very excellent speech.
3554,PONNONNER.,
3555,PONNONNER.,"I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent"
3556,PONNONNER.,"conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive"
3557,PONNONNER.,"Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other"
3558,PONNONNER.,"untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of"
3559,PONNONNER.,"Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke"
3560,PONNONNER.,the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I
3561,PONNONNER.,"could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of"
3562,PONNONNER.,"images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)"
3563,PONNONNER.,"the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of"
3564,PONNONNER.,sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.
3565,PONNONNER.,"Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian"
3566,PONNONNER.,"comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a"
3567,PONNONNER.,"bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,"
3568,PONNONNER.,"standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown"
3569,PONNONNER.,"forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the"
3570,PONNONNER.,mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.
3571,PONNONNER.,"Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at"
3572,PONNONNER.,"Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and"
3573,PONNONNER.,consented to take off his own.
3574,PONNONNER.,
3575,PONNONNER.,It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly
3576,PONNONNER.,upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and
3577,PONNONNER.,"disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any"
3578,PONNONNER.,"disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the"
3579,PONNONNER.,individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for
3580,PONNONNER.,"it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were"
3581,PONNONNER.,"now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation"
3582,PONNONNER.,intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.
3583,PONNONNER.,
3584,PONNONNER.,"In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that"
3585,PONNONNER.,"Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did"
3586,PONNONNER.,not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the
3587,PONNONNER.,"apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the"
3588,PONNONNER.,company all round.
3589,PONNONNER.,
3590,PONNONNER.,"When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in"
3591,PONNONNER.,repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We
3592,PONNONNER.,"sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square"
3593,PONNONNER.,inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.
3594,PONNONNER.,
3595,PONNONNER.,"It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of"
3596,PONNONNER.,Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.
3597,PONNONNER.,"The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a"
3598,PONNONNER.,"black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid"
3599,PONNONNER.,"pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,"
3600,PONNONNER.,"a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,"
3601,PONNONNER.,"patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of"
3602,PONNONNER.,"whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between"
3603,PONNONNER.,"the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was"
3604,PONNONNER.,some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of
3605,PONNONNER.,"the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be"
3606,PONNONNER.,"dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a"
3607,PONNONNER.,"comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the"
3608,PONNONNER.,spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.
3609,PONNONNER.,
3610,PONNONNER.,"The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,"
3611,PONNONNER.,expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s
3612,PONNONNER.,still remaining alive.
3613,PONNONNER.,
3614,PONNONNER.,"“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time"
3615,PONNONNER.,you were dead.”
3616,PONNONNER.,
3617,PONNONNER.,
3618,PONNONNER.,"“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than"
3619,PONNONNER.,"seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means"
3620,PONNONNER.,in his dotage when he died.”
3621,PONNONNER.,
3622,PONNONNER.,
3623,PONNONNER.,"Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of"
3624,PONNONNER.,which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly
3625,PONNONNER.,misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since
3626,PONNONNER.,he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.
3627,PONNONNER.,
3628,PONNONNER.,"“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at"
3629,PONNONNER.,"the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are"
3630,PONNONNER.,"still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during"
3631,PONNONNER.,"which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”"
3632,PONNONNER.,
3633,PONNONNER.,
3634,PONNONNER.,“In what?” said the Count.
3635,PONNONNER.,
3636,PONNONNER.,"“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B."
3637,PONNONNER.,
3638,PONNONNER.,"“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to"
3639,PONNONNER.,"answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else"
3640,PONNONNER.,than the Bichloride of Mercury.”
3641,PONNONNER.,
3642,PONNONNER.,
3643,PONNONNER.,"“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor"
3644,PONNONNER.,"Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt"
3645,PONNONNER.,"five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so"
3646,PONNONNER.,delightfully well.”
3647,PONNONNER.,
3648,PONNONNER.,
3649,PONNONNER.,"“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than"
3650,PONNONNER.,"probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the"
3651,PONNONNER.,"infancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common"
3652,PONNONNER.,"thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,"
3653,PONNONNER.,and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should
3654,PONNONNER.,be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of
3655,PONNONNER.,the chief principle of the embalming process?”
3656,PONNONNER.,
3657,PONNONNER.,
3658,PONNONNER.,"“Why, not altogether.”"
3659,PONNONNER.,
3660,PONNONNER.,
3661,PONNONNER.,"“Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot"
3662,PONNONNER.,enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm
3663,PONNONNER.,"(properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal"
3664,PONNONNER.,functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest
3665,PONNONNER.,"sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being."
3666,PONNONNER.,"I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in"
3667,PONNONNER.,"the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the"
3668,PONNONNER.,"animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever"
3669,PONNONNER.,"condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that"
3670,PONNONNER.,"condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of"
3671,PONNONNER.,"the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”"
3672,PONNONNER.,
3673,PONNONNER.,
3674,PONNONNER.,“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.
3675,PONNONNER.,
3676,PONNONNER.,"“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very"
3677,PONNONNER.,distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the
3678,PONNONNER.,"Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is"
3679,PONNONNER.,the insignium. I speak figuratively.”
3680,PONNONNER.,
3681,PONNONNER.,
3682,PONNONNER.,“But what has this to do with you being alive?”
3683,PONNONNER.,
3684,PONNONNER.,
3685,PONNONNER.,"“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before"
3686,PONNONNER.,"embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did"
3687,PONNONNER.,"not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I"
3688,PONNONNER.,should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is
3689,PONNONNER.,inconvenient to live.”
3690,PONNONNER.,
3691,PONNONNER.,
3692,PONNONNER.,"“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire"
3693,PONNONNER.,mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”
3694,PONNONNER.,
3695,PONNONNER.,
3696,PONNONNER.,“Beyond doubt.”
3697,PONNONNER.,
3698,PONNONNER.,
3699,PONNONNER.,"“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one"
3700,PONNONNER.,of the Egyptian gods.”
3701,PONNONNER.,
3702,PONNONNER.,
3703,PONNONNER.,"“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its"
3704,PONNONNER.,feet.
3705,PONNONNER.,
3706,PONNONNER.,“Gods!” repeated the traveller.
3707,PONNONNER.,
3708,PONNONNER.,"“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said"
3709,PONNONNER.,"the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has"
3710,PONNONNER.,"ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were"
3711,PONNONNER.,"with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or"
3712,PONNONNER.,"media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be"
3713,PONNONNER.,more directly approached.”
3714,PONNONNER.,
3715,PONNONNER.,
3716,PONNONNER.,There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor
3717,PONNONNER.,Ponnonner.
3718,PONNONNER.,
3719,PONNONNER.,"“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that"
3720,PONNONNER.,among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the
3721,PONNONNER.,"Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”"
3722,PONNONNER.,
3723,PONNONNER.,
3724,PONNONNER.,"“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei"
3725,PONNONNER.,"embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those"
3726,PONNONNER.,"purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and"
3727,PONNONNER.,still remain in the tomb.”
3728,PONNONNER.,
3729,PONNONNER.,
3730,PONNONNER.,"“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely"
3731,PONNONNER.,so embalmed’?”
3732,PONNONNER.,
3733,PONNONNER.,
3734,PONNONNER.,"“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely"
3735,PONNONNER.,through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to
3736,PONNONNER.,address him a direct question.
3737,PONNONNER.,
3738,PONNONNER.,"“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my"
3739,PONNONNER.,"time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most"
3740,PONNONNER.,"extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer"
3741,PONNONNER.,than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.
3742,PONNONNER.,"After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already"
3743,PONNONNER.,"described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable"
3744,PONNONNER.,"curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of"
3745,PONNONNER.,"science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the"
3746,PONNONNER.,"case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this"
3747,PONNONNER.,"kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age"
3748,PONNONNER.,"of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself"
3749,PONNONNER.,"carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that"
3750,PONNONNER.,they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say
3751,PONNONNER.,five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this
3752,PONNONNER.,"time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of"
3753,PONNONNER.,"hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena"
3754,PONNONNER.,"for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole"
3755,PONNONNER.,"herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under"
3756,PONNONNER.,"the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have"
3757,PONNONNER.,"enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go"
3758,PONNONNER.,"about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was"
3759,PONNONNER.,"never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it"
3760,PONNONNER.,was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work
3761,PONNONNER.,"immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,"
3762,PONNONNER.,the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally
3763,PONNONNER.,"lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,"
3764,PONNONNER.,"pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of"
3765,PONNONNER.,preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”
3766,PONNONNER.,
3767,PONNONNER.,
3768,PONNONNER.,"“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand"
3769,PONNONNER.,"gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may"
3770,PONNONNER.,I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”
3771,PONNONNER.,
3772,PONNONNER.,
3773,PONNONNER.,"“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up."
3774,PONNONNER.,
3775,PONNONNER.,"“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned"
3776,PONNONNER.,the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own
3777,PONNONNER.,"epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were"
3778,PONNONNER.,usually found to be right?”
3779,PONNONNER.,
3780,PONNONNER.,
3781,PONNONNER.,"“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to"
3782,PONNONNER.,be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written
3783,PONNONNER.,"histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of"
3784,PONNONNER.,"either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and"
3785,PONNONNER.,radically wrong.”
3786,PONNONNER.,
3787,PONNONNER.,
3788,PONNONNER.,"“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five"
3789,PONNONNER.,"thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted"
3790,PONNONNER.,"that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were"
3791,PONNONNER.,"sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the"
3792,PONNONNER.,"Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten"
3793,PONNONNER.,centuries before.”
3794,PONNONNER.,
3795,PONNONNER.,
3796,PONNONNER.,“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.
3797,PONNONNER.,
3798,PONNONNER.,"The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional"
3799,PONNONNER.,explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The
3800,PONNONNER.,"latter at length said, hesitatingly:"
3801,PONNONNER.,
3802,PONNONNER.,"“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During"
3803,PONNONNER.,my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the
3804,PONNONNER.,universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at
3805,PONNONNER.,"all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by"
3806,PONNONNER.,"a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_"
3807,PONNONNER.,"and by this individual, the very word _Adam_ (or Red Earth), which"
3808,PONNONNER.,"you make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical"
3809,PONNONNER.,"sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just"
3810,PONNONNER.,as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the
3811,PONNONNER.,"spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously"
3812,PONNONNER.,upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”
3813,PONNONNER.,
3814,PONNONNER.,
3815,PONNONNER.,"Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of"
3816,PONNONNER.,"us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,"
3817,PONNONNER.,first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of
3818,PONNONNER.,"Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:"
3819,PONNONNER.,
3820,PONNONNER.,"“The long duration of human life in your time, together with the"
3821,PONNONNER.,"occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,"
3822,PONNONNER.,"must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and"
3823,PONNONNER.,"conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to"
3824,PONNONNER.,attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars
3825,PONNONNER.,"of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the"
3826,PONNONNER.,"Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”"
3827,PONNONNER.,
3828,PONNONNER.,
3829,PONNONNER.,"“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am"
3830,PONNONNER.,"somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science"
3831,PONNONNER.,do you allude?”
3832,PONNONNER.,
3833,PONNONNER.,
3834,PONNONNER.,"Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the"
3835,PONNONNER.,assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.
3836,PONNONNER.,
3837,PONNONNER.,"Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,"
3838,PONNONNER.,which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had
3839,PONNONNER.,flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly
3840,PONNONNER.,"forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible"
3841,PONNONNER.,tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban
3842,PONNONNER.,"savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things."
3843,PONNONNER.,
3844,PONNONNER.,I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He
3845,PONNONNER.,"smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were."
3846,PONNONNER.,
3847,PONNONNER.,"This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to"
3848,PONNONNER.,"his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as"
3849,PONNONNER.,"yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this"
3850,PONNONNER.,"head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one"
3851,PONNONNER.,Plutarch de facie lunae.
3852,PONNONNER.,
3853,PONNONNER.,"I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in"
3854,PONNONNER.,"general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my"
3855,PONNONNER.,"queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,"
3856,PONNONNER.,and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for
3857,PONNONNER.,"the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns"
3858,PONNONNER.,possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the
3859,PONNONNER.,style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this
3860,PONNONNER.,"question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very"
3861,PONNONNER.,extraordinary way.
3862,PONNONNER.,
3863,PONNONNER.,"“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of"
3864,PONNONNER.,"both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose."
3865,PONNONNER.,
3866,PONNONNER.,"“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New"
3867,PONNONNER.,"York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the"
3868,PONNONNER.,"Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went"
3869,PONNONNER.,"on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he"
3870,PONNONNER.,referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less
3871,PONNONNER.,"than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart."
3872,PONNONNER.,
3873,PONNONNER.,"The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that"
3874,PONNONNER.,"moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of"
3875,PONNONNER.,"the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but"
3876,PONNONNER.,"the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in"
3877,PONNONNER.,"a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,"
3878,PONNONNER.,"(talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a"
3879,PONNONNER.,"kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four"
3880,PONNONNER.,"columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart."
3881,PONNONNER.,"The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two"
3882,PONNONNER.,"miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,"
3883,PONNONNER.,and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could
3884,PONNONNER.,"remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been"
3885,PONNONNER.,"altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,"
3886,PONNONNER.,"within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert"
3887,PONNONNER.,that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built
3888,PONNONNER.,"within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred"
3889,PONNONNER.,of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at
3890,PONNONNER.,"Carnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),"
3891,PONNONNER.,"however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,"
3892,PONNONNER.,"magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as"
3893,PONNONNER.,"described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever"
3894,PONNONNER.,been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.
3895,PONNONNER.,
3896,PONNONNER.,I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.
3897,PONNONNER.,
3898,PONNONNER.,"“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather"
3899,PONNONNER.,"ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of"
3900,PONNONNER.,"course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which"
3901,PONNONNER.,the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and
3902,PONNONNER.,fifty feet in altitude.
3903,PONNONNER.,
3904,PONNONNER.,I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.
3905,PONNONNER.,
3906,PONNONNER.,"He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should"
3907,PONNONNER.,have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the
3908,PONNONNER.,little palace at Carnac.
3909,PONNONNER.,
3910,PONNONNER.,"This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of"
3911,PONNONNER.,Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon
3912,PONNONNER.,"winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently"
3913,PONNONNER.,discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.
3914,PONNONNER.,
3915,PONNONNER.,"I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked"
3916,PONNONNER.,me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the
3917,PONNONNER.,"obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper."
3918,PONNONNER.,
3919,PONNONNER.,This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the
3920,PONNONNER.,"attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and"
3921,PONNONNER.,"read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,"
3922,PONNONNER.,but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.
3923,PONNONNER.,
3924,PONNONNER.,The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in
3925,PONNONNER.,"his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it"
3926,PONNONNER.,never progressed.
3927,PONNONNER.,
3928,PONNONNER.,"We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at"
3929,PONNONNER.,much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we
3930,PONNONNER.,"enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king."
3931,PONNONNER.,
3932,PONNONNER.,"He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused."
3933,PONNONNER.,"When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred"
3934,PONNONNER.,something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined
3935,PONNONNER.,"all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of"
3936,PONNONNER.,"mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious"
3937,PONNONNER.,constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed
3938,PONNONNER.,remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing
3939,PONNONNER.,"ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some"
3940,PONNONNER.,"fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism"
3941,PONNONNER.,that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.
3942,PONNONNER.,
3943,PONNONNER.,I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.
3944,PONNONNER.,
3945,PONNONNER.,"As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob."
3946,PONNONNER.,
3947,PONNONNER.,"Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the"
3948,PONNONNER.,Egyptian ignorance of steam.
3949,PONNONNER.,
3950,PONNONNER.,"The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The"
3951,PONNONNER.,"silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his"
3952,PONNONNER.,elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and
3953,PONNONNER.,demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern
3954,PONNONNER.,"steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de"
3955,PONNONNER.,Caus.
3956,PONNONNER.,
3957,PONNONNER.,"We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck"
3958,PONNONNER.,"would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,"
3959,PONNONNER.,and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the
3960,PONNONNER.,moderns in the all-important particular of dress.

3962,PONNONNER.,"The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and"
3963,PONNONNER.,"then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to"
3964,PONNONNER.,"his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended"
3965,PONNONNER.,itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said
3966,PONNONNER.,any thing in the way of reply.

3968,PONNONNER.,"Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy"
3969,PONNONNER.,"with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a"
3970,PONNONNER.,"gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the"
3971,PONNONNER.,manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.
3972,PONNONNER.,
3973,PONNONNER.,"We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was"
3974,PONNONNER.,not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was
3975,PONNONNER.,triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.
3976,PONNONNER.,"Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s"
3977,PONNONNER.,"mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave."

3979,PONNONNER.,"Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to"

3982,PONNONNER.,"behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of"
3983,PONNONNER.,this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that

3994,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
3995,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either"
3996,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the"
3997,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite"
3998,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which"
3999,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most"
4000,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems of little"
4001,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard"
4002,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully,"
4003,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I
4004,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, “a long"
4005,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms."
4006,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4007,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it
4008,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of"
4009,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal"
4010,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem"
4011,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of"
4012,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it"
4013,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in"
4014,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"effect, and in fact, no longer such."
4015,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4016,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the"
4017,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired
4018,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during"
4019,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand."
4020,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing"
4021,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it"
4022,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its"
4023,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)
4024,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of"
4025,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true
4026,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no"
4027,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the"
4028,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,"
4029,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that
4030,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had
4031,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,"
4032,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a"
4033,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.
4034,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4035,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good"
4036,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the"
4037,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect"
4038,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but"
4039,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic
4040,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem _were _popular"
4041,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem"
4042,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,will ever be popular again.
4043,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4044,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure"
4045,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition"
4046,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly
4047,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly"
4048,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"considered—there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a"
4049,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from"
4050,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment"
4051,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a"
4052,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after _this _fashion
4053,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies
4054,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As _yet, _they have"
4055,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"not _insisted _on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or"
4056,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to _infer _from their
4057,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"continual plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any"
4058,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for"
4059,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the effort—if this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us
4060,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that
4061,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art"
4062,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,rather by the impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than
4063,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained"
4064,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The
4065,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor"
4066,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this"
4067,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as"
4068,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities,"
4069,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,they will not be essentially damaged as truths.
4070,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4071,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue"
4072,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now"
4073,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or"
4074,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon
4075,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and"
4076,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp"
4077,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers"
4078,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind."
4079,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4080,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,"
4081,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following"
4082,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,exquisite little Serenade—
4083,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4084,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4085,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I arise from dreams of thee
4086,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In the first sweet sleep of night,"
4087,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"When the winds are breathing low,"
4088,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And the stars are shining bright.
4089,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I arise from dreams of thee,"
4090,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And a spirit in my feet
4091,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Has led me—who knows how?—
4092,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"To thy chamber-window, sweet!"
4093,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4094,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The wandering airs they faint
4095,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,On the dark the silent stream—
4096,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The champak odors fail
4097,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
4098,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The nightingale’s complaint,"
4099,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"It dies upon her heart,"
4100,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"As I must die on shine,"
4101,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"O, beloved as thou art!"
4102,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4103,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"O, lift me from the grass!"
4104,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I die, I faint, I fail!"
4105,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Let thy love in kisses rain
4106,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,On my lips and eyelids pale.
4107,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"My cheek is cold and white, alas!"
4108,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,My heart beats loud and fast:
4109,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"O, press it close to shine again,"
4110,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Where it will break at last.
4111,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4112,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4113,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet
4114,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal"
4115,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by"
4116,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
4117,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.
4118,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4119,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which
4120,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue"
4121,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the"
4122,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4123,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The shadows lay along Broadway,"
4124,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,’Twas near the twilight-tide—
4125,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And slowly there a lady fair
4126,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Was walking in her pride.
4127,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,"
4128,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Walk’d spirits at her side.
4129,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,"
4130,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And Honor charm’d the air;
4131,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And all astir looked kind on her,"
4132,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And called her good as fair—
4133,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,For all God ever gave to her
4134,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,She kept with chary care.
4135,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,She kept with care her beauties rare
4136,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,From lovers warm and true—
4137,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"For heart was cold to all but gold,"
4138,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And the rich came not to won,"
4139,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,But honor’d well her charms to sell.
4140,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,If priests the selling do.
4141,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Now walking there was one more fair—
4142,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A slight girl, lily-pale;"
4143,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And she had unseen company
4144,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,To make the spirit quail—
4145,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"’Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,"
4146,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And nothing could avail.
4147,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,No mercy now can clear her brow
4148,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,From this world’s peace to pray
4149,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,"
4150,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Her woman’s heart gave way!—
4151,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven
4152,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,By man is cursed alway!
4153,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4154,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has
4155,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly
4156,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident"
4157,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other"
4158,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,works of this author.
4159,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4160,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is"
4161,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the"
4162,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a"
4163,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the"
4164,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more"
4165,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies
4166,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic. _It has been
4167,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate"
4168,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a"
4169,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.
4170,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians"
4171,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads
4172,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such"
4173,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting"
4174,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that
4175,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should
4176,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can
4177,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"_exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than"
4178,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"this very poem, this poem _per se, _this poem which is a poem and"
4179,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake."
4180,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4181,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I"
4182,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I"
4183,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The
4184,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All _that
4185,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,_which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that _with
4186,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,which _she _has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a
4187,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth
4188,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,"
4189,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must"
4190,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the"
4191,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,poetical. _He _must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical
4192,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of
4193,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of"
4194,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the"
4195,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.
4196,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4197,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
4198,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I"
4199,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the"
4200,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but
4201,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle
4202,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues
4203,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio marked
4204,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with
4205,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is"
4206,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the"
4207,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with"
4208,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of
4209,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,"
4210,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty."
4211,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4212,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense
4213,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the
4214,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists."
4215,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in"
4216,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and"
4217,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the"
4218,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,"
4219,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of"
4220,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and"
4221,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sentiments which greet _him _in common with all mankind—he, I"
4222,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something"
4223,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst
4224,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This"
4225,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and
4226,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for
4227,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild"
4228,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of
4229,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among"
4230,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness
4231,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by
4232,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find"
4233,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina"
4234,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,"
4235,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at"
4236,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’"
4237,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"_the poem, or _through _the music, we attain to but brief and"
4238,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,indeterminate glimpses.
4239,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4240,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on"
4241,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all
4242,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,_that _which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to
4243,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,understand and _to feel _as poetic.
4244,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4245,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in"
4246,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very"
4247,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in"
4248,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has"
4249,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly
4250,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,"
4251,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment"
4252,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an
4253,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not"
4254,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps
4255,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired"
4256,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal"
4257,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Beauty. It _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and"
4258,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"then, attained in _fact. _We are often made to feel, with a shivering"
4259,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have"
4260,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in
4261,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the"
4262,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers
4263,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his"
4264,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems."
4265,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4266,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words"
4267,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. _Its sole arbiter is Taste.
4268,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral
4269,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with"
4270,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Duty or with Truth.
4271,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4272,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A few words, however, in explanation. _That _pleasure which is at"
4273,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,"
4274,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation"
4275,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,"
4276,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"or excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the Poetic"
4277,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the"
4278,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of"
4279,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of"
4280,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because"
4281,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as
4282,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been
4283,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most
4284,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"readily _attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that"
4285,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons"
4286,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they"
4287,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the"
4288,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper
4289,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,subjection to that _Beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real
4290,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,essence of the poem.
4291,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4292,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your
4293,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s “Waif”:—"
4294,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4295,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The day is done, and the darkness"
4296,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Falls from the wings of Night,"
4297,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,As a feather is wafted downward
4298,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,From an Eagle in his flight.
4299,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I see the lights of the village
4300,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Gleam through the rain and the mist,"
4301,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,"
4302,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,That my soul cannot resist;
4303,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A feeling of sadness and longing,"
4304,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That is not akin to pain,"
4305,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And resembles sorrow only
4306,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,As the mist resembles the rain.
4307,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Come, read to me some poem,"
4308,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Some simple and heartfelt lay,"
4309,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That shall soothe this restless feeling,"
4310,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And banish the thoughts of day.
4311,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Not from the grand old masters,"
4312,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Not from the bards sublime,"
4313,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Whose distant footsteps echo
4314,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Through the corridors of Time.
4315,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"For, like strains of martial music,"
4316,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Their mighty thoughts suggest
4317,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Life’s endless toil and endeavor;
4318,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And to-night I long for rest.
4319,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Read from some humbler poet,"
4320,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Whose songs gushed from his heart,"
4321,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"As showers from the clouds of summer,"
4322,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Or tears from the eyelids start;
4323,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Who through long days of labor,"
4324,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And nights devoid of ease,"
4325,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Still heard in his soul the music
4326,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Of wonderful melodies.
4327,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Such songs have power to quiet
4328,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The restless pulse of care,"
4329,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And come like the benediction
4330,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,That follows after prayer.
4331,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Then read from the treasured volume
4332,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The poem of thy choice,"
4333,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And lend to the rhyme of the poet
4334,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The beauty of thy voice.
4335,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And the night shall be filled with music,"
4336,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And the cares that infest the day
4337,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,"
4338,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And as silently steal away.
4339,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4340,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired"
4341,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.
4342,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Nothing can be better than—
4343,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4344,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"———————the bards sublime,"
4345,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Whose distant footsteps echo
4346,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Down the corridors of Time.
4347,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4348,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the
4349,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance"
4350,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"_of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the"
4351,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. This"
4352,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"“ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion"
4353,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult
4354,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him
4355,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the
4356,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the"
4357,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"tone, _in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind"
4358,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion."
4359,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should"
4360,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many"
4361,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"_occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be"
4362,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the"
4363,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.
4364,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4365,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one"
4366,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—
4367,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4368,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"There, through the long, long summer hours,"
4369,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The golden light should lie,"
4370,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
4371,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Stand in their beauty by.
4372,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The oriole should build and tell
4373,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"His love-tale, close beside my cell;"
4374,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The idle butterfly
4375,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Should rest him there, and there be heard"
4376,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The housewife-bee and humming bird.
4377,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,"
4378,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Come, from the village sent,"
4379,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,"
4380,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,With fairy laughter blent?
4381,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And what if, in the evening light,"
4382,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Betrothed lovers walk in sight
4383,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Of my low monument?
4384,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I would the lovely scene around
4385,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Might know no sadder sight nor sound.
4386,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I know, I know I should not see"
4387,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The season’s glorious show,"
4388,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Nor would its brightness shine for me;
4389,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Nor its wild music flow;
4390,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"But if, around my place of sleep,"
4391,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The friends I love should come to weep,"
4392,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,They might not haste to go.
4393,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,"
4394,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Should keep them lingering by my tomb.
4395,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,These to their soften’d hearts should bear
4396,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The thoughts of what has been,"
4397,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And speak of one who cannot share
4398,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The gladness of the scene;
4399,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Whose part in all the pomp that fills
4400,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The circuit of the summer hills,"
4401,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Is—that his grave is green;
4402,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And deeply would their hearts rejoice
4403,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,To hear again his living voice.
4404,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4405,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more
4406,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The
4407,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all"
4408,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the"
4409,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The
4410,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining"
4411,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a"
4412,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know"
4413,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the
4414,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,"
4415,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4416,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,A feeling of sadness and longing
4417,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That is not akin to pain,"
4418,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And resembles sorrow only
4419,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,As the mist resembles the rain.
4420,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4421,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
4422,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:—
4423,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4424,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I fill this cup to one made up
4425,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Of loveliness alone,"
4426,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A woman, of her gentle sex"
4427,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The seeming paragon;
4428,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,To whom the better elements
4429,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And kindly stars have given
4430,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A form so fair that, like the air,"
4431,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,’Tis less of earth than heaven.
4432,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Her every tone is music’s own,"
4433,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Like those of morning birds,"
4434,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And something more than melody
4435,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Dwells ever in her words;
4436,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The coinage of her heart are they,"
4437,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And from her lips each flows
4438,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,As one may see the burden’d bee
4439,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Forth issue from the rose.
4440,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Affections are as thoughts to her,"
4441,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The measures of her hours;
4442,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Her feelings have the flagrancy,"
4443,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The freshness of young flowers;
4444,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And lovely passions, changing oft,"
4445,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So fill her, she appears"
4446,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The image of themselves by turns,—"
4447,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The idol of past years!
4448,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Of her bright face one glance will trace
4449,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A picture on the brain,"
4450,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And of her voice in echoing hearts
4451,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,A sound must long remain;
4452,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"But memory, such as mine of her,"
4453,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So very much endears,"
4454,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,When death is nigh my latest sigh
4455,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Will not be life’s, but hers."
4456,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I fill’d this cup to one made up
4457,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Of loveliness alone,"
4458,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"A woman, of her gentle sex"
4459,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The seeming paragon—
4460,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Her health! and would on earth there stood,"
4461,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Some more of such a frame,"
4462,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That life might be all poetry,"
4463,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And weariness a name.
4464,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4465,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had
4466,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as"
4467,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long
4468,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing"
4469,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is especially
4470,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly
4471,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the
4472,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,evident earnestness with which they are uttered.
4473,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4474,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits"
4475,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,_of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for
4476,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us"
4477,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very
4478,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the
4479,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing
4480,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all"
4481,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the chaff _for his reward.
4482,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4483,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by
4484,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that
4485,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.
4486,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an"
4487,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. It"
4488,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,is _not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and
4489,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to"
4490,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,admit that they are _not _merits altogether.
4491,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4492,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character
4493,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude
4494,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to his lines beginning—“Come, rest in this bosom.” The intense"
4495,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There
4496,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all
4497,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"in all _of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps,"
4498,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any"
4499,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,other single sentiment ever embodied in words:—
4500,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4501,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer"
4502,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;"
4503,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,"
4504,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.
4505,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Oh! what was love made for, if ’tis not the same"
4506,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?"
4507,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,"
4508,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art."
4509,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,"
4510,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—"
4511,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,"
4512,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!"
4513,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4514,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while"
4515,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than
4516,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact
4517,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other"
4518,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very"
4519,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _But never was there a"
4520,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.
4521,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more
4522,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"profoundly—more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than"
4523,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which
4524,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to
4525,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,remember them.
4526,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4527,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most"
4528,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had"
4529,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,always for me an inexpressible charm:—
4530,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4531,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,O saw ye not fair Ines?
4532,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"She’s gone into the West,"
4533,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"To dazzle when the sun is down,"
4534,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And rob the world of rest;
4535,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"She took our daylight with her,"
4536,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The smiles that we love best,"
4537,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"With morning blushes on her cheek,"
4538,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And pearls upon her breast.
4539,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"O turn again, fair Ines,"
4540,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Before the fall of night,"
4541,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"For fear the moon should shine alone,"
4542,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And stars unrivalltd bright;
4543,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And blessed will the lover be
4544,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That walks beneath their light,"
4545,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And breathes the love against thy cheek
4546,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,I dare not even write!
4547,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Would I had been, fair Ines,"
4548,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That gallant cavalier,"
4549,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Who rode so gaily by thy side,"
4550,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And whisper’d thee so near!
4551,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Were there no bonny dames at home
4552,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Or no true lovers here,"
4553,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,That he should cross the seas to win
4554,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The dearest of the dear?
4555,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I saw thee, lovely Ines,"
4556,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Descend along the shore,"
4557,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"With bands of noble gentlemen,"
4558,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And banners waved before;
4559,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And gentle youth and maidens gay,"
4560,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And snowy plumes they wore;
4561,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"It would have been a beauteous dream,"
4562,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,If it had been no more!
4563,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Alas, alas, fair Ines,"
4564,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"She went away with song,"
4565,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"With music waiting on her steps,"
4566,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And shootings of the throng;
4567,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"But some were sad and felt no mirth,"
4568,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"But only Music’s wrong,"
4569,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,"
4570,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,To her you’ve loved so long.
4571,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,"
4572,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,That vessel never bore
4573,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So fair a lady on its deck,"
4574,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Nor danced so light before,—"
4575,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Alas for pleasure on the sea,"
4576,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And sorrow on the shorel
4577,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The smile that blest one lover’s heart
4578,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Has broken many more!
4579,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4580,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"“The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever"
4581,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of"
4582,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It"
4583,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length"
4584,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it
4585,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,permit me to offer the universally appreciated “Bridge of Sighs”:—
4586,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4587,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"One more Unfortunate,"
4588,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Weary of breath,"
4589,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Rashly importunate
4590,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Gone to her death!
4591,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Take her up tenderly,"
4592,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Lift her with care;—
4593,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Fashion’d so slenderly,"
4594,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Young and so fair!
4595,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Look at her garments
4596,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Clinging like cerements;
4597,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Whilst the wave constantly
4598,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Drips from her clothing;
4599,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Take her up instantly,"
4600,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Loving not loathing.
4601,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Touch her not scornfully;
4602,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Think of her mournfully,"
4603,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Gently and humanly;
4604,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Not of the stains of her,"
4605,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,All that remains of her
4606,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Now is pure womanly.
4607,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Make no deep scrutiny
4608,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Into her mutiny
4609,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Rash and undutiful;
4610,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Past all dishonor,"
4611,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Death has left on her
4612,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Only the beautiful.
4613,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Where the lamps quiver
4614,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So far in the river,"
4615,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,With many a light
4616,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,From window and casement
4617,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"From garret to basement,"
4618,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"She stood, with amazement,"
4619,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Houseless by night.
4620,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The bleak wind of March
4621,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Made her tremble and shiver,"
4622,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"But not the dark arch,"
4623,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Or the black flowing river:
4624,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Mad from life’s history,"
4625,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Glad to death’s mystery,"
4626,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Swift to be hurl’d—
4627,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Anywhere, anywhere"
4628,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Out of the world!
4629,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In she plunged boldly,"
4630,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,No matter how coldly
4631,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The rough river ran,—"
4632,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Over the brink of it,"
4633,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Picture it,—think of it,"
4634,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Dissolute Man!
4635,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Lave in it, drink of it"
4636,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Then, if you can!"
4637,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Still, for all slips of hers,"
4638,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,One of Eve’s family—
4639,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Wipe those poor lips of hers
4640,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Oozing so clammily,"
4641,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Loop up her tresses
4642,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Escaped from the comb,"
4643,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Her fair auburn tresses;
4644,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Whilst wonderment guesses
4645,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Where was her home?
4646,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Who was her father?
4647,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Who was her mother?
4648,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Had she a sister?
4649,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Had she a brother?
4650,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Or was there a dearer one
4651,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Still, and a nearer one"
4652,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Yet, than all other?"
4653,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Alas! for the rarity
4654,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Of Christian charity
4655,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Under the sun!
4656,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Oh! it was pitiful!
4657,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Near a whole city full,"
4658,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Home she had none.
4659,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Sisterly, brotherly,"
4660,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Fatherly, motherly,"
4661,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Feelings had changed:
4662,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Love, by harsh evidence,"
4663,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Thrown from its eminence;
4664,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Even God’s providence
4665,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Seeming estranged.
4666,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Take her up tenderly;
4667,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Lift her with care;
4668,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Fashion’d so slenderly,"
4669,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Young, and so fair!"
4670,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Ere her limbs frigidly
4671,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Stiffen too rigidly,"
4672,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Decently,—kindly,—"
4673,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Smooth and compose them;
4674,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And her eyes, close them,"
4675,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Staring so blindly!
4676,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Dreadfully staring
4677,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Through muddy impurity,"
4678,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,As when with the daring
4679,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Last look of despairing
4680,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Fixed on futurity.
4681,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Perhishing gloomily,"
4682,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Spurred by contumely,"
4683,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Cold inhumanity,"
4684,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Burning insanity,"
4685,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Into her rest,—"
4686,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Cross her hands humbly,"
4687,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"As if praying dumbly,"
4688,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Over her breast!
4689,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Owning her weakness,"
4690,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Her evil behavior,"
4691,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And leaving, with meekness,"
4692,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Her sins to her Saviour!
4693,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4694,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The
4695,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
4696,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is"
4697,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the thesis of the poem.
4698,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4699,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from
4700,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—
4701,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4702,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though the day of my destiny’s over,"
4703,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And the star of my fate bath declined
4704,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Thy soft heart refused to discover
4705,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The faults which so many could find;
4706,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,"
4707,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"It shrunk not to share it with me,"
4708,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And the love which my spirit bath painted
4709,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,It never bath found but in _thee._
4710,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Then when nature around me is smiling,"
4711,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"The last smile which answers to mine,"
4712,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I do not believe it beguiling,"
4713,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Because it reminds me of shine;
4714,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And when winds are at war with the ocean,"
4715,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"As the breasts I believed in with me,"
4716,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"If their billows excite an emotion,"
4717,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,It is that they bear me from _thee._
4718,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,"
4719,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And its fragments are sunk in the wave,"
4720,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Though I feel that my soul is delivered
4721,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,To pain—it shall not be its slave.
4722,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,There is many a pang to pursue me:
4723,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"They may crush, but they shall not contemn—"
4724,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"They may torture, but shall not subdue me—"
4725,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,’Tis of _thee _that I think—not of them.
4726,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though human, thou didst not deceive me,"
4727,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though woman, thou didst not forsake,"
4728,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,"
4729,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—"
4730,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,"
4731,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though parted, it was not to fly,"
4732,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,"
4733,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Nor mute, that the world might belie."
4734,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,"
4735,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Nor the war of the many with one—
4736,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"If my soul was not fitted to prize it,"
4737,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,’Twas folly not sooner to shun:
4738,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And if dearly that error bath cost me,"
4739,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And more than I once could foresee,"
4740,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"I have found that whatever it lost me,"
4741,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,It could not deprive me of _thee._
4742,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,"
4743,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Thus much I at least may recall,"
4744,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,It bath taught me that which I most cherished
4745,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Deserved to be dearest of all:
4746,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In the desert a fountain is springing,"
4747,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In the wide waste there still is a tree,"
4748,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"And a bird in the solitude singing,"
4749,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Which speaks to my spirit of _thee._
4750,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4751,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification"
4752,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,could scarcely be improved. No nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of
4753,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself
4754,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the
4755,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,unwavering love of woman.
4756,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4757,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the"
4758,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very"
4759,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"brief specimen. I call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets, _not"
4760,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,_because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most
4761,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,profound—_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces
4762,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,is at _all _times the most intense—but because it is at all
4763,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most"
4764,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read"
4765,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—"
4766,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4767,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,"
4768,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Tears from the depth of some divine despair
4769,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,"
4770,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"In looking on the happy Autumn fields,"
4771,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And thinking of the days that are no more.
4772,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,"
4773,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"That brings our friends up from the underworld,"
4774,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Sad as the last which reddens over one
4775,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,That sinks with all we love below the verge;
4776,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more."
4777,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns"
4778,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds
4779,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"To dying ears, when unto dying eyes"
4780,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
4781,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"So sad, so strange, the days that are no more."
4782,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Dear as remember’d kisses after death,"
4783,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d
4784,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"On lips that are for others; deep as love,"
4785,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;"
4786,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"O Death in Life, the days that are no more."
4787,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4788,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored"
4789,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my
4790,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and"
4791,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the"
4792,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul, _quite"
4793,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of"
4794,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to
4795,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul."
4796,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the"
4797,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably
4798,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,"
4799,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a"
4800,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true"
4801,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and"
4802,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the
4803,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,harmony manifest.
4804,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4805,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what"
4806,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements"
4807,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the
4808,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in
4809,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in
4810,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in
4811,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in
4812,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in
4813,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of
4814,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of
4815,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice
4816,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the
4817,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the
4818,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that
4819,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim"
4820,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in"
4821,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,"
4822,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in"
4823,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody
4824,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony"
4825,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning
4826,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in
4827,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above"
4828,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in"
4829,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"the strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love."
4830,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4831,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one
4832,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by
4833,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern and"
4834,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are"
4835,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the
4836,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do"
4837,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old
4838,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,cavalier:—
4839,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,
4840,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,"
4841,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,And don your helmes amaine:
4842,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call
4843,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
4844,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—"
4845,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe"
4846,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,For the fayrest of the land;
4847,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Let piping swaine, and craven wight,"
4848,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,"Thus weepe and poling crye,"
4849,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,Our business is like men to fight.
4850,THE POETIC PRINCIPLE,

4854,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)
4855,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4856,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4857,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with
4858,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to
4859,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love"
4860,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic"
4861,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),sentiment inspired_by their writings should be ascribed to a fact
4862,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and"
4863,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a"
4864,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout
4865,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,"
4866,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,"
4867,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being"
4868,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be"
4869,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This
4870,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the"
4871,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is"
4872,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied.
4873,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in"
4874,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have"
4875,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is,"
4876,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against"
4877,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),the poets _thew. _There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old
4878,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned,"
4879,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough
4880,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley
4881,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With
4882,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet
4883,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he"
4884,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the
4885,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished
4886,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the
4887,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a"
4888,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane
4889,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of
4890,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the
4891,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),man. And he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well
4892,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up
4893,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very"
4894,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their
4895,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that
4896,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),soul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon-to
4897,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle"
4898,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the"
4899,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a"
4900,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be
4901,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris _paribus) more
4902,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),artificial.
4903,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4904,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book of
4905,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible
4906,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to
4907,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered"
4908,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of
4909,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their"
4910,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us.
4911,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion,"
4912,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the Queen of Bohemia”—that"
4913,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"“there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd."
4914,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4915,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy
4916,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here
4917,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession"
4918,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other
4919,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,"
4920,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,"
4921,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without"
4922,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),even an attempt at adaptation.
4923,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4924,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The"
4925,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable"
4926,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the"
4927,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),author says:
4928,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4929,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"“By the murmur of a spring,"
4930,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Or the least boughs rustleling,"
4931,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"By a daisy whose leaves spread,"
4932,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Shut when Titan goes to bed,"
4933,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Or a shady bush or tree,"
4934,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),She could more infuse in me
4935,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Than all Nature’s beauties can
4936,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),In some other wiser man.
4937,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),By her help I also now
4938,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Make this churlish place allow
4939,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Something that may sweeten gladness
4940,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),In the very gall of sadness—
4941,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"The dull loneness, the black shade,"
4942,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),That these hanging vaults have made
4943,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),The strange music of the waves
4944,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Beating on these hollow caves,"
4945,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"This black den which rocks emboss,"
4946,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Overgrown with eldest moss,"
4947,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),The rude portals that give light
4948,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"More to terror than delight,"
4949,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),This my chamber of neglect
4950,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Walled about with disrespect;
4951,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),From all these and this dull air
4952,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"A fit object for despair,"
4953,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),She hath taught me by her might
4954,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),To draw comfort and delight.”
4955,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4956,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4957,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general"
4958,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in
4959,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s “Maiden
4960,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the"
4961,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos,"
4962,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its

4968,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"It oft would challenge me the race,"
4969,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),And when’t had left me far away
4970,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;"
4971,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"For it was nimbler much than hinds,"
4972,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),And trod as if on the four winds.
4973,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"I have a garden of my own,"
4974,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"But so with roses overgrown,"
4975,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"And lilies, that you would it guess"
4976,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),To be a little wilderness;
4977,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),And all the spring-time of the year
4978,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),It only loved to be there.
4979,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Among the beds of lilies I
4980,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Have sought it oft where it should lie,"
4981,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Yet could not, till itself would rise,"
4982,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Find it, although before mine eyes."
4983,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),For in the flaxen lilies’ shade
4984,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),It like a bank of lilies laid;
4985,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),Upon the roses it would feed
4986,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Until its lips even seemed to bleed,"
4987,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"And then to me ’twould boldly trip,"
4988,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"And print those roses on my lip,"
4989,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),But all its chief delight was still
4990,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"With roses thus itself to fill,"
4991,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),And its pure virgin limbs to fold
4992,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
4993,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Had it lived long, it would have been"
4994,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"Lilies without, roses within.”"
4995,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4996,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
4997,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It
4998,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the
4999,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over
5000,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties"
5001,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud
5002,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The whole is"
5003,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea
5004,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the"
5005,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,"
5006,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little
5007,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon
5008,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy"
5009,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her
5010,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the
5011,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the
5012,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the fawn
5013,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running"
5014,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to"
5015,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How
5016,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,"
5017,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5018,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),“And trod as if on the four winds!”
5019,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5020,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5021,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the
5022,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then"
5023,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and"
5024,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the fawn loving to be there,"
5025,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),and there “only”—the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”—and
5026,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would
5027,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),rise”—the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the
5028,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"loving to “fill itself with roses,”"
5029,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5030,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),“And its pure virgin limbs to fold
5031,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”"
5032,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5033,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent
5034,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only"
5035,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the"
5036,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate"
5037,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),admiration of the bereaved child—
5038,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),
5039,OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*),"“Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”"

5067,PREFACE,These trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their
5068,PREFACE,redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected
5069,PREFACE,while going at random the “rounds of the press.” I am naturally anxious
5070,PREFACE,"that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate"
5071,PREFACE,"at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me"
5072,PREFACE,"to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or"
5073,PREFACE,very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have prevented me
5074,PREFACE,"from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier"
5075,PREFACE,"circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me poetry has"
5076,PREFACE,"been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in"
5077,PREFACE,"reverence: they must not-they can not at will be excited, with an eye to"
5078,PREFACE,"the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of man-kind."

5091,THE RAVEN.,THE RAVEN.
5092,THE RAVEN.,
5093,THE RAVEN.,
5094,THE RAVEN.,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,"
5095,THE RAVEN.,"Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,"
5096,THE RAVEN.,"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
5097,THE RAVEN.,"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
5098,THE RAVEN.,"“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—"
5099,THE RAVEN.,"Only this, and nothing more.”"
5100,THE RAVEN.,"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,"
5101,THE RAVEN.,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
5102,THE RAVEN.,Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
5103,THE RAVEN.,From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
5104,THE RAVEN.,For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
5105,THE RAVEN.,Nameless here for evermore.
5106,THE RAVEN.,And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
5107,THE RAVEN.,Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
5108,THE RAVEN.,"So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating"
5109,THE RAVEN.,“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
5110,THE RAVEN.,Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
5111,THE RAVEN.,"This it is, and nothing more.”"
5112,THE RAVEN.,"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
5113,THE RAVEN.,"“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"
5114,THE RAVEN.,"But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
5115,THE RAVEN.,"And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,"
5116,THE RAVEN.,That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door:——
5117,THE RAVEN.,Darkness there and nothing more.
5118,THE RAVEN.,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,"
5119,THE RAVEN.,"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;"
5120,THE RAVEN.,"But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,"
5121,THE RAVEN.,"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”"
5122,THE RAVEN.,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”"
5123,THE RAVEN.,"Merely this, and nothing more."
5124,THE RAVEN.,"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
5125,THE RAVEN.,Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.
5126,THE RAVEN.,"“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;"
5127,THE RAVEN.,"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—"
5128,THE RAVEN.,Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
5129,THE RAVEN.,’Tis the wind and nothing more!”
5130,THE RAVEN.,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,"
5131,THE RAVEN.,In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
5132,THE RAVEN.,Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
5133,THE RAVEN.,"But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—"
5134,THE RAVEN.,Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
5135,THE RAVEN.,"Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
5136,THE RAVEN.,"Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
5137,THE RAVEN.,"By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
5138,THE RAVEN.,"“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,"
5139,THE RAVEN.,Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
5140,THE RAVEN.,Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
5141,THE RAVEN.,Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”
5142,THE RAVEN.,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
5143,THE RAVEN.,Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
5144,THE RAVEN.,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
5145,THE RAVEN.,Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
5146,THE RAVEN.,"Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
5147,THE RAVEN.,With such name as “Nevermore.”
5148,THE RAVEN.,"But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only"
5149,THE RAVEN.,"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour."
5150,THE RAVEN.,Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
5151,THE RAVEN.,Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
5152,THE RAVEN.,"On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”"
5153,THE RAVEN.,Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
5154,THE RAVEN.,"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
5155,THE RAVEN.,"“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store"
5156,THE RAVEN.,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
5157,THE RAVEN.,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
5158,THE RAVEN.,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
5159,THE RAVEN.,Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”
5160,THE RAVEN.,"But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,"
5161,THE RAVEN.,"Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;"
5162,THE RAVEN.,"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking"
5163,THE RAVEN.,"Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—"
5164,THE RAVEN.,"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore"
5165,THE RAVEN.,Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
5166,THE RAVEN.,"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
5167,THE RAVEN.,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
5168,THE RAVEN.,"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
5169,THE RAVEN.,"On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o’er,"
5170,THE RAVEN.,"But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,"
5171,THE RAVEN.,"_She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!"
5172,THE RAVEN.,"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
5173,THE RAVEN.,Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
5174,THE RAVEN.,"“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent"
5175,THE RAVEN.,thee
5176,THE RAVEN.,Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
5177,THE RAVEN.,"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”"
5178,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”"
5179,THE RAVEN.,"“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—"
5180,THE RAVEN.,"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
5181,THE RAVEN.,"Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—"
5182,THE RAVEN.,"On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—"
5183,THE RAVEN.,"Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”"
5184,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”"
5185,THE RAVEN.,"“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!"
5186,THE RAVEN.,By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
5187,THE RAVEN.,"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,"
5188,THE RAVEN.,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
5189,THE RAVEN.,Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
5190,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”"
5191,THE RAVEN.,"“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—"
5192,THE RAVEN.,“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
5193,THE RAVEN.,Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
5194,THE RAVEN.,Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
5195,THE RAVEN.,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”"
5196,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”"
5197,THE RAVEN.,"And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
5198,THE RAVEN.,On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
5199,THE RAVEN.,"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,"
5200,THE RAVEN.,And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
5201,THE RAVEN.,And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
5202,THE RAVEN.,Shall be lifted—nevermore!

5353,ULALUME,"Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,"
5354,ULALUME,In the ultimate climes of the Pole—
5355,ULALUME,That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
5356,ULALUME,In the realms of the Boreal Pole.
5357,ULALUME,"Our talk had been serious and sober,"
5358,ULALUME,But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
5359,ULALUME,Our memories were treacherous and sere;
5360,ULALUME,"For we knew not the month was October,"
5361,ULALUME,And we marked not the night of the year—
5362,ULALUME,"(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)"
5363,ULALUME,"We noted not the dim lake of Auber,"
5364,ULALUME,(Though once we had journeyed down here)
5365,ULALUME,"We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,"
5366,ULALUME,Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
5367,ULALUME,"And now, as the night was senescent,"
5368,ULALUME,And star-dials pointed to morn—
5369,ULALUME,As the star-dials hinted of morn—
5370,ULALUME,At the end of our path a liquescent
5371,ULALUME,"And nebulous lustre was born,"
5372,ULALUME,Out of which a miraculous crescent
5373,ULALUME,Arose with a duplicate horn—
5374,ULALUME,"Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,"
5375,ULALUME,Distinct with its duplicate horn.
5376,ULALUME,And I said—“She is warmer than Dian:
5377,ULALUME,She rolls through an ether of sighs—
5378,ULALUME,She revels in a region of sighs.
5379,ULALUME,She has seen that the tears are not dry on
5380,ULALUME,"These cheeks, where the worm never dies,"
5381,ULALUME,"And has come past the stars of the Lion,"
5382,ULALUME,To point us the path to the skies—
5383,ULALUME,To the Lethean peace of the skies—
5384,ULALUME,"Come up, in despite of the Lion,"
5385,ULALUME,To shine on us with her bright eyes—
5386,ULALUME,"Come up, through the lair of the Lion,"
5387,ULALUME,With love in her luminous eyes.”
5388,ULALUME,"But Psyche, uplifting her finger,"
5389,ULALUME,Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—
5390,ULALUME,Her pallor I strangely mistrust—
5391,ULALUME,"Ah, hasten!—ah, let us not linger!"
5392,ULALUME,"Ah, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”"
5393,ULALUME,In terror she spoke; letting sink her
5394,ULALUME,Wings till they trailed in the dust—
5395,ULALUME,"In agony sobbed, letting sink her"
5396,ULALUME,Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
5397,ULALUME,Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.
5398,ULALUME,I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming.
5399,ULALUME,"Let us on, by this tremulous light!"
5400,ULALUME,Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
5401,ULALUME,Its Sybillic splendor is beaming
5402,ULALUME,With Hope and in Beauty to-night—
5403,ULALUME,See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
5404,ULALUME,"Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,"
5405,ULALUME,And be sure it will lead us aright—
5406,ULALUME,We safely may trust to a gleaming
5407,ULALUME,"That cannot but guide us aright,"
5408,ULALUME,Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”
5409,ULALUME,"Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,"
5410,ULALUME,And tempted her out of her gloom—
5411,ULALUME,And conquered her scruples and gloom;
5412,ULALUME,And we passed to the end of the vista—
5413,ULALUME,But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
5414,ULALUME,By the door of a legended tomb:—
5415,ULALUME,"And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,"
5416,ULALUME,On the door of this legended tomb?”
5417,ULALUME,She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—
5418,ULALUME,’Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”
5419,ULALUME,Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
5420,ULALUME,As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—
5421,ULALUME,As the leaves that were withering and sere—
5422,ULALUME,And I cried—“It was surely October
5423,ULALUME,"On _this_ very night of last year,"
5424,ULALUME,That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—
5425,ULALUME,That I brought a dread burden down here—
5426,ULALUME,"On this night, of all nights in the year,"
5427,ULALUME,"Ah, what demon has tempted me here?"
5428,ULALUME,"Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—"
5429,ULALUME,This misty mid region of Weir:—
5430,ULALUME,"Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—"
5431,ULALUME,This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”

5438,TO HELEN,TO HELEN
5439,TO HELEN,
5440,TO HELEN,
5441,TO HELEN,I saw thee once—once only—years ago:
5442,TO HELEN,I must not say _how_ many—but _not_ many.
5443,TO HELEN,It was a July midnight; and from out
5444,TO HELEN,"A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,"
5445,TO HELEN,"Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,"
5446,TO HELEN,"There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,"
5447,TO HELEN,"With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,"
5448,TO HELEN,Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
5449,TO HELEN,"Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,"
5450,TO HELEN,"Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—"
5451,TO HELEN,Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
5452,TO HELEN,"That gave out, in return for the love-light,"
5453,TO HELEN,Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—
5454,TO HELEN,Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
5455,TO HELEN,"That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted"
5456,TO HELEN,"By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence."
5457,TO HELEN,"Clad all in white, upon a violet bank"
5458,TO HELEN,I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
5459,TO HELEN,"Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,"
5460,TO HELEN,"And on thine own, upturn’d—alas, in sorrow!"
5461,TO HELEN,
5462,TO HELEN,"Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight—"
5463,TO HELEN,"Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)"
5464,TO HELEN,"That bade me pause before that garden-gate,"
5465,TO HELEN,To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
5466,TO HELEN,"No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,"
5467,TO HELEN,"Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!—oh, God!"
5468,TO HELEN,How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)
5469,TO HELEN,Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked—
5470,TO HELEN,And in an instant all things disappeared.
5471,TO HELEN,"(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)"
5472,TO HELEN,The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
5473,TO HELEN,"The mossy banks and the meandering paths,"
5474,TO HELEN,"The happy flowers and the repining trees,"
5475,TO HELEN,Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors
5476,TO HELEN,Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
5477,TO HELEN,All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:
5478,TO HELEN,Save only the divine light in thine eyes—
5479,TO HELEN,Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
5480,TO HELEN,I saw but them—they were the world to me!
5481,TO HELEN,"I saw but them—saw only them for hours,"
5482,TO HELEN,Saw only them until the moon went down.
5483,TO HELEN,What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten
5484,TO HELEN,"Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!"
5485,TO HELEN,"How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!"
5486,TO HELEN,How silently serene a sea of pride!
5487,TO HELEN,How daring an ambition; yet how deep—
5488,TO HELEN,How fathomless a capacity for love!
5489,TO HELEN,"But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,"
5490,TO HELEN,Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
5491,TO HELEN,"And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees"
5492,TO HELEN,Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained;_
5493,TO HELEN,They _would not_ go—they never yet have gone;
5494,TO HELEN,"Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,"
5495,TO HELEN,_They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since;
5496,TO HELEN,They follow me—they lead me through the years.
5497,TO HELEN,They are my ministers—yet I their slave.
5498,TO HELEN,Their office is to illumine and enkindle—
5499,TO HELEN,"My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,"
5500,TO HELEN,"And purified in their electric fire,"
5501,TO HELEN,And sanctified in their elysian fire.
5502,TO HELEN,"They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),"
5503,TO HELEN,And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to
5504,TO HELEN,"In the sad, silent watches of my night;"
5505,TO HELEN,While even in the meridian glare of day
5506,TO HELEN,I see them still—two sweetly scintillant
5507,TO HELEN,"Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"

5513,ANNABEL LEE.,
5514,ANNABEL LEE.,
5515,ANNABEL LEE.,"It was many and many a year ago,"
5516,ANNABEL LEE.,"In a kingdom by the sea,"
5517,ANNABEL LEE.,That a maiden lived whom you may know
5518,ANNABEL LEE.,By the name of ANNABEL LEE;—
5519,ANNABEL LEE.,And this maiden she lived with no other thought
5520,ANNABEL LEE.,Than to love and be loved by me.
5521,ANNABEL LEE.,"_I_ was a child and _She_ was a child,"
5522,ANNABEL LEE.,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
5523,ANNABEL LEE.,But we loved with a love that was more than love—
5524,ANNABEL LEE.,I and my ANNABEL LEE—
5525,ANNABEL LEE.,With a love that the wingéd seraphs of Heaven
5526,ANNABEL LEE.,Coveted her and me.
5527,ANNABEL LEE.,"And this was the reason that, long ago,"
5528,ANNABEL LEE.,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
5529,ANNABEL LEE.,A wind blew out of a cloud by night
5530,ANNABEL LEE.,Chilling my ANNABEL LEE;
5531,ANNABEL LEE.,So that her high-born kinsmen came
5532,ANNABEL LEE.,"And bore her away from me,"
5533,ANNABEL LEE.,"To shut her up, in a sepulchre"
5534,ANNABEL LEE.,In this kingdom by the sea.
5535,ANNABEL LEE.,"The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,"
5536,ANNABEL LEE.,Went envying her and me;
5537,ANNABEL LEE.,"Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,"
5538,ANNABEL LEE.,In this kingdom by the sea)
5539,ANNABEL LEE.,"That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling"
5540,ANNABEL LEE.,And killing my ANNABEL LEE.
5541,ANNABEL LEE.,But our love it was stronger by far than the love
5542,ANNABEL LEE.,Of those who were older than we—
5543,ANNABEL LEE.,Of many far wiser than we—
5544,ANNABEL LEE.,And neither the angels in Heaven above
5545,ANNABEL LEE.,Nor the demons down under the sea
5546,ANNABEL LEE.,Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
5547,ANNABEL LEE.,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:—
5548,ANNABEL LEE.,For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
5549,ANNABEL LEE.,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
5550,ANNABEL LEE.,And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
5551,ANNABEL LEE.,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
5552,ANNABEL LEE.,"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side"
5553,ANNABEL LEE.,"Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride"
5554,ANNABEL LEE.,In her sepulchre there by the sea—

5719,FOR ANNIE,"When the light was extinguished,"

5724,FOR ANNIE,To shield me from harm.
5725,FOR ANNIE,"And I lie so composedly,"
5726,FOR ANNIE,"Now in my bed,"
5727,FOR ANNIE,(Knowing her love)
5728,FOR ANNIE,That you fancy me dead—

6112,NOTES,"1. “The Raven” was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New"
6113,NOTES,York “Evening Mirror”-a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It
6114,NOTES,"was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N."
6115,NOTES,P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the
6116,NOTES,"second number of the “American Review,” the following remarkable poem by"
6117,NOTES,"Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of"
6118,NOTES,"‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in"
6119,NOTES,"English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification,"
6120,NOTES,and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is
6121,NOTES,one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to
6122,NOTES,the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the
6123,NOTES,"“American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was"
6124,NOTES,"introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by"
6125,NOTES,Poe himself.
6126,NOTES,
6127,NOTES,"[“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain"
6128,NOTES,"of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches"
6129,NOTES,"amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the"
6130,NOTES,author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique
6131,NOTES,rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English
6132,NOTES,"rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing"
6133,NOTES,"corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much"
6134,NOTES,"more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic"
6135,NOTES,"tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several"
6136,NOTES,"advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater"
6137,NOTES,"abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and very great advantages of"
6138,NOTES,sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect
6139,NOTES,of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen
6140,NOTES,"that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the"
6141,NOTES,studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its
6142,NOTES,"measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they"
6143,NOTES,"might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon"
6144,NOTES,form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in
6145,NOTES,"the verse” (stanza?)—“which flows continuously, with only an"
6146,NOTES,"aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the"
6147,NOTES,"Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of"
6148,NOTES,"sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different"
6149,NOTES,effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were
6150,NOTES,better understood.”—ED. “Am. Rev.”]

6157,NOTES,
6158,I.,I.
6159,I.,"The bells!-ah, the bells!"
6160,I.,The little silver bells!
6161,I.,How fairy-like a melody there floats
6162,I.,From their throats—
6163,I.,From their merry little throats—
6164,I.,"From the silver, tinkling throats"
6165,I.,"Of the bells, bells, bells—"
6166,I.,Of the bells!
6167,II.,II.
6168,II.,"The bells!-ah, the bells!"
6169,II.,The heavy iron bells!
6170,II.,How horrible a monody there floats
6171,II.,From their throats—
6172,II.,From their deep-toned throats—
6173,II.,From their melancholy throats!
6174,II.,"How I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells—"
6175,II.,Of the bells!
6176,II.,
6177,II.,"In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to"
6178,II.,"the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the"
6179,II.,"following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much"
6180,II.,enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without
6181,II.,"publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version,"
6182,II.,"was sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union"
6183,II.,Magazine.”
6184,II.,
6185,II.,
6186,II.,3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for
6187,II.,"December, 1847, as “To—Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted"
6188,II.,"immediately in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications"
6189,II.,"with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to"
6190,II.,"him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza"
6191,II.,"which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely"
6192,II.,suppressed:
6193,II.,
6194,II.,"Said we then—we two, then—“Ah, can it"
6195,II.,Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—
6196,II.,"The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—"
6197,II.,To bar up our path and to ban it
6198,II.,From the secret that lies in these wolds—
6199,II.,Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
6200,II.,From the limbo of lunary souls—
6201,II.,This sinfully scintillant planet
6202,II.,From the Hell of the planetary souls?”
6203,II.,
6204,II.,
6205,II.,"4. “To Helen” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,"
6206,II.,"1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the"
6207,II.,"“Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or"
6208,II.,"desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats"
6209,II.,in coupling those two words.”
6210,II.,
6211,II.,
6212,II.,"5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression"
6213,II.,"of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one"
6214,II.,of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a
6215,II.,"copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it"
6216,II.,"appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While"
6217,II.,"suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of"
6218,II.,"“Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who"
6219,II.,"published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s"
6220,II.,"death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed"
6221,II.,"into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the"
6222,II.,"poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else"
6223,II.,had an opportunity of publishing it.
6224,II.,
6225,II.,"6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to"
6226,II.,have been written early in 1846.
6227,II.,
6228,II.,"7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent to"
6229,II.,"that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March appeared"
6230,II.,in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”
6231,II.,
6232,II.,
6233,II.,"8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to"
6234,II.,"the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849, but does not appear"
6235,II.,"to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in"
6236,II.,the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.
6237,II.,
6238,II.,"9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the"
6239,II.,"spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly"
6240,II.,afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”
6241,II.,
6242,II.,
6243,II.,10. “To F——” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the
6244,II.,"“Broadway Journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied"
6245,II.,"from those inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for"
6246,II.,"July, 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed,"
6247,II.,"in “Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”"
6248,II.,
6249,II.,
6250,II.,"11. “To F——s S. O—d,” a portion of the poet’s triune"
6251,II.,"tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for"
6252,II.,"September, 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the"
6253,II.,"“Southern Literary Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an"
6254,II.,"Album,” and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter."
6255,II.,"Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine”"
6256,II.,"for August, 1839, as “To——.”"
6257,II.,
6258,II.,
6259,II.,"12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849, in"
6260,II.,"the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the"
6261,II.,author’s finishing touches.

6557,DREAM-LAND,Their still waters—still and chilly
6558,DREAM-LAND,With the snows of the lolling lily.
6559,DREAM-LAND,By the lakes that thus outspread
6560,DREAM-LAND,"Their lone waters, lone and dead,—"

6562,DREAM-LAND,"With the snows of the lolling lily,—"

6654,I.,Rome.—A Hall in a Palace  Alessandra and Castiglione.
6655,I.,"Alessandra.  Thou art sad, Castiglione."
6656,I.,Castiglione.  Sad!—not I.
6657,I.,"Oh, I’m the happiest, happiest man in Rome!"
6658,I.,"A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,"
6659,I.,"Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!"
6660,I.,Aless.  Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
6661,I.,"Thy happiness!—what ails thee, cousin of mine?"
6662,I.,Why didst thou sigh so deeply?
6663,I.,Cas.  Did I sign?
6664,I.,"I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,"
6665,I.,A silly—a most silly fashion I have
6666,I.,When I am very happy. Did I sigh?                         (sighing.)
6667,I.,Aless. Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
6668,I.,"Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it."
6669,I.,"Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these"
6670,I.,Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—
6671,I.,Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away
6672,I.,The constitution as late hours and wine.
6673,I.,"Cas. (musing.)  Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—not even deep"
6674,I.,sorrow—
6675,I.,Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
6676,I.,I will amend.
6677,I.,Aless. Do it! I would have thee drop
6678,I.,"Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born—"
6679,I.,Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio’s heir
6680,I.,And Alessandra’s husband.
6681,I.,Cas.  I will drop them.
6682,I.,Aless.   Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more
6683,I.,To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain
6684,I.,For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends
6685,I.,Upon appearances.
6686,I.,Cas.  I’ll see to it.
6687,I.,"Aless. Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,"
6688,I.,To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest
6689,I.,In dignity.
6690,I.,"Cas.  Much, much, oh! much I want"
6691,I.,In proper dignity.
6692,I.,"Aless.(haughtily)  Thou mockest me, sir!"
6693,I.,"Cas. (abstractedly.)  Sweet, gentle Lalage!"
6694,I.,Aless. Heard I aright?
6695,I.,I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage!
6696,I.,Sir Count! (places her hand on his shoulder) what art thou dreaming?
6697,I.,he’s not well!
6698,I.,"What ails thee, sir?"
6699,I.,Cas. (startling.)  Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!
6700,I.,I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—
6701,I.,"Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please."
6702,I.,This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!
6703,I.,Enter Di Broglio.
6704,I.,"Di Broglio.  My son, I’ve news for thee!—hey?—what’s the"
6705,I.,matter? (observing Alessandra)
6706,I.,"I’ the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,"
6707,I.,"You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!"
6708,I.,I’ve news for you both. Politian is expected
6709,I.,"Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!"
6710,I.,We’ll have him at the wedding. ’Tis his first visit
6711,I.,To the imperial city.
6712,I.,Aless. What! Politian
6713,I.,"Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?"
6714,I.,"Di Brog.  The same, my love."
6715,I.,We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
6716,I.,"In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,"
6717,I.,But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy
6718,I.,"Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,"
6719,I.,And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.
6720,I.,Aless. I have heard much of this Politian.
6721,I.,"Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not?"
6722,I.,And little given to thinking.
6723,I.,"Di Brog.  Far from it, love."
6724,I.,"No branch, they say, of all philosophy"
6725,I.,So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
6726,I.,Learned as few are learned.
6727,I.,Aless. ’Tis very strange!
6728,I.,I have known men have seen Politian
6729,I.,And sought his company. They speak of him
6730,I.,"As of one who entered madly into life,"
6731,I.,Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.
6732,I.,Cas.  Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian
6733,I.,And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.
6734,I.,He is a dreamer and a man shut out
6735,I.,From common passions.
6736,I.,"Di Brog.  Children, we disagree."
6737,I.,Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
6738,I.,"Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear"
6739,I.,Politian was a melancholy man?                             (exeunt.)
6740,II,II
6741,II,"ROME. A Lady’s apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden."
6742,II,"Lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a"
6743,II,hand mirror. In the background Jacinta (a servant maid) leans carelessly
6744,II,upon a chair.
6745,II,Lal. [Lalage] Jacinta! is it thou?
6746,II,"Jac. [Jacinta] (pertly.) Yes, Ma’am, I’m here."
6747,II,"Lal.   I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting."
6748,II,Sit down!—Let not my presence trouble you—
6749,II,"Sit down!—for I am humble, most humble."
6750,II,Jac. (aside.) ’Tis time.
6751,II,"(Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her"
6752,II,"elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look."
6753,II,Lalage continues to read. )
6754,II,"Lal. “It in another climate, so he said,"
6755,II,"Bore a bright golden flower, but not i’ this soil!”"
6756,II,"(pauses—turns over some leaves, and resumes)"
6757,II,"No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower—"
6758,II,But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
6759,II,Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”
6760,II,"O, beautiful!—most beautiful—how like"
6761,II,To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
6762,II,O happy land (pauses) She died!—the maiden died!
6763,II,A still more happy maiden who couldst die!
6764,II,Jacinta!
6765,II,"(Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes.)"
6766,II,Again!—a similar tale
6767,II,Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
6768,II,Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play—
6769,II,“She died full young”—one Bossola answers him—
6770,II,“I think not so—her infelicity
6771,II,Seemed to have years too many”—Ah luckless lady!
6772,II,Jacinta! (still no answer)
6773,II,"Here ’s a far sterner story,"
6774,II,"But like—oh, very like in its despair—"
6775,II,"Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily"
6776,II,A thousand hearts—losing at length her own.
6777,II,She died. Thus endeth the history—and her maids
6778,II,Lean over and weep—two gentle maids
6779,II,With gentle names—Eiros and Charmion!
6780,II,Rainbow and Dove!——Jacinta!
6781,II,"Jac. (pettishly.) Madam, what is it?"
6782,II,"Lal.  Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind"
6783,II,As go down in the library and bring me
6784,II,The Holy Evangelists.
6785,II,Jac. Pshaw!   (exit.)
6786,II,Lal. If there be balm
6787,II,For the wounded spirit in Gilead it is there!
6788,II,Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
6789,II,Will there be found—“dew sweeter far than that
6790,II,Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.”
6791,II,"(re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table.)"
6792,II,"There, ma’am, ’s the book. Indeed she is very troublesome.  (aside.)"
6793,II,"Lal. (astonished.)  What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I done aught"
6794,II,To grieve thee or to vex thee?—I am sorry.
6795,II,For thou hast served me long and ever been
6796,II,Trust-worthy and respectful.                   (resumes her reading.)
6797,II,Jac. I can’t believe
6798,II,She has any more jewels—no—no—she gave me all.    (aside.)
6799,II,"Lal. What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me"
6800,II,Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
6801,II,How fares good Ugo?—and when is it to be?
6802,II,Can I do aught?—is there no farther aid
6803,II,"Thou needest, Jacinta?"
6804,II,Jac. Is there no farther aid!
6805,II,"That’s meant for me. (aside) I’m sure, madam, you need not"
6806,II,Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.
6807,II,"Lal. Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta,"
6808,II,I thought not of the jewels.
6809,II,Jac. Oh! perhaps not!
6810,II,"But then I might have sworn it. After all,"
6811,II,"There ’s Ugo says the ring is only paste,"
6812,II,For he ’s sure the Count Castiglione never
6813,II,Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
6814,II,"And at the best I’m certain, Madam, you cannot"
6815,II,Have use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.          (exit.)
6816,II,(Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table—after a
6817,II,short pause raises it.)
6818,II,Lal.  Poor Lalage!—and is it come to this?
6819,II,Thy servant maid!—but courage!—’tis but a viper
6820,II,Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
6821,II,(taking up the mirror)
6822,II,Ha! here at least ’s a friend—too much a friend
6823,II,In earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.
6824,II,Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
6825,II,A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not
6826,II,Though it be rife with woe: It answers me.
6827,II,"It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,"
6828,II,And Beauty long deceased—remembers me
6829,II,"Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope,"
6830,II,"Inurned and entombed:—now, in a tone"
6831,II,"Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,"
6832,II,Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
6833,II,For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true—thou liest not!
6834,II,Thou hast no end to gain—no heart to break—
6835,II,Castiglione lied who said he loved—
6836,II,Thou true—he false!—false!—false!
6837,II,"(While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment, and approaches"
6838,II,unobserved.)
6839,II,"Monk. Refuge thou hast,"
6840,II,"Sweet daughter, in Heaven. Think of eternal things!"
6841,II,"Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!"
6842,II,Lal. (arising hurriedly.)  I cannot pray!—My soul is at war
6843,II,with God!
6844,II,The frightful sounds of merriment below
6845,II,Disturb my senses—go! I cannot pray—
6846,II,The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
6847,II,Thy presence grieves me—go!—thy priestly raiment
6848,II,Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix
6849,II,With horror and awe!
6850,II,Monk. Think of thy precious soul!
6851,II,Lal.  Think of my early days!—think of my father
6852,II,"And mother in Heaven think of our quiet home,"
6853,II,And the rivulet that ran before the door!
6854,II,Think of my little sisters!—think of them!
6855,II,And think of me!—think of my trusting love
6856,II,And confidence—his vows—my ruin—think—think
6857,II,Of my unspeakable misery!—begone!
6858,II,Yet stay! yet stay!—what was it thou saidst of prayer
6859,II,And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
6860,II,And vows before the throne?
6861,II,Monk.  I did.
6862,II,Lal. Lal. ’Tis well.
6863,II,There is a vow were fitting should be made—
6864,II,"A sacred vow, imperative, and urgent,"
6865,II,A solemn vow!
6866,II,"Monk. Daughter, this zeal is well!"
6867,II,"Lal.  Father, this zeal is anything but well!"
6868,II,Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
6869,II,A crucifix whereon to register
6870,II,This sacred vow?                             (he hands her his own)
6871,II,Not that—Oh! no!—no!—no!                            (shuddering)
6872,II,"Not that! Not that!—I tell thee, holy man,"
6873,II,Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
6874,II,"Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,—"
6875,II,I have a crucifix Methinks ’twere fitting
6876,II,The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—
6877,II,"And the deed’s register should tally, father!"
6878,II,"(draws a cross-handled dagger, and raises it on high)"
6879,II,Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
6880,II,Is written in Heaven!
6881,II,"Monk. Thy words are madness, daughter,"
6882,II,And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—
6883,II,Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine!
6884,II,"Pause ere too late!—oh, be not—be not rash!"
6885,II,"Swear not the oath—oh, swear it not!"
6886,II,Lal. ’Tis sworn!
6887,III.,III.
6888,III.,An apartment in a Palace. Politian and Baldazzar.
6889,III.,"Baldazzar.—Arouse thee now, Politian!"
6890,III.,"Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, shalt not"
6891,III.,Give away unto these humors. Be thyself!
6892,III.,"Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,"
6893,III.,"And live, for now thou diest!"
6894,III.,"Politian.  Not so, Baldazzar! Surely I live."
6895,III.,"Bal. Politian, it doth grieve me"
6896,III.,To see thee thus.
6897,III.,"Pol.  Baldazzar, it doth grieve me"
6898,III.,"To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend."
6899,III.,"Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?"
6900,III.,At thy behest I will shake off that nature
6901,III.,"Which from my forefathers I did inherit,"
6902,III.,"Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,"
6903,III.,"And be no more Politian, but some other."
6904,III.,"Command me, sir!"
6905,III.,"Bal.  To the field, then—to the field—"
6906,III.,To the senate or the field.
6907,III.,Pol. Alas! Alas!
6908,III.,There is an imp would follow me even there!
6909,III.,There is an imp hath followed me even there!
6910,III.,There is—what voice was that?
6911,III.,Bal.  I heard it not.
6912,III.,"I heard not any voice except thine own,"
6913,III.,And the echo of thine own.
6914,III.,Pol.  Then I but dreamed.
6915,III.,"Bal.  Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court,"
6916,III.,Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—
6917,III.,And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
6918,III.,In hearkening to imaginary sounds
6919,III.,And phantom voices.
6920,III.,Pol.  It is a phantom voice!
6921,III.,Didst thou not hear it then?
6922,III.,Bal.  I heard it not.
6923,III.,"Pol.  Thou heardst it not!—Baldazaar, speak no more"
6924,III.,"To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts."
6925,III.,"Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,"
6926,III.,Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
6927,III.,Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!
6928,III.,We have been boys together—schoolfellows—
6929,III.,And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—
6930,III.,For in the eternal city thou shalt do me
6931,III.,"A kind and gentle office, and a Power—"
6932,III.,"A Power august, benignant and supreme—"
6933,III.,Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
6934,III.,Unto thy friend.
6935,III.,Bal.  Thou speakest a fearful riddle
6936,III.,I will not understand.
6937,III.,Pol.  Yet now as Fate
6938,III.,"Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,"
6939,III.,"The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,"
6940,III.,"And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!"
6941,III.,"I cannot die, having within my heart"
6942,III.,So keen a relish for the beautiful
6943,III.,As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
6944,III.,Is balmier now than it was wont to be—
6945,III.,Rich melodies are floating in the winds—
6946,III.,A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—
6947,III.,And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
6948,III.,Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say
6949,III.,"Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?"
6950,III.,Bal.  Indeed I hear not.
6951,III.,Pol.  Not hear it!—listen now!—listen!—the faintest sound
6952,III.,And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
6953,III.,A lady’s voice!—and sorrow in the tone!
6954,III.,"Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!"
6955,III.,Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls
6956,III.,Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
6957,III.,Surely I never heard—yet it were well
6958,III.,Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones
6959,III.,In earlier days!
6960,III.,Bal.  I myself hear it now.
6961,III.,"Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,"
6962,III.,Proceeds from yonder lattice—which you may see
6963,III.,"Very plainly through the window—it belongs,"
6964,III.,Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
6965,III.,The singer is undoubtedly beneath
6966,III.,The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps
6967,III.,Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
6968,III.,"As the betrothed of Castiglione,"
6969,III.,His son and heir.
6970,III.,Pol.  Be still!—it comes again!
6971,III.,Voice        “And is thy heart so strong
6972,III.,(very faintly)   As for to leave me thus
6973,III.,Who hath loved thee so long
6974,III.,In wealth and woe among?
6975,III.,And is thy heart so strong
6976,III.,As for to leave me thus?
6977,III.,Say nay—say nay!”
6978,III.,"Bal.  The song is English, and I oft have heard it"
6979,III.,In merry England—never so plaintively—
6980,III.,Hist! hist! it comes again!
6981,III.,Voice            “Is it so strong
6982,III.,(more loudly)    As for to leave me thus
6983,III.,Who hath loved thee so long
6984,III.,In wealth and woe among?
6985,III.,And is thy heart so strong
6986,III.,As for to leave me thus?
6987,III.,Say nay—say nay!”
6988,III.,Bal.  ’Tis hushed and all is still!
6989,III.,Pol.  All is not still!
6990,III.,Bal.  Let us go down.
6991,III.,"Pol.  Go down, Baldazzar, go!"
6992,III.,Bal.  The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits use—
6993,III.,Thy presence is expected in the hall
6994,III.,"Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?"
6995,III.,Voice           “Who hath loved thee so long
6996,III.,"(distinctly)        In wealth and woe among,"
6997,III.,And is thy heart so strong?
6998,III.,Say nay—say nay!”
6999,III.,"Bal.  Let us descend!—’tis time. Politian, give"
7000,III.,"These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,"
7001,III.,Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
7002,III.,Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember
7003,III.,Pol.  Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.
7004,III.,(going.)
7005,III.,"Let us descend. Believe me I would give,"
7006,III.,Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
7007,III.,To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—
7008,III.,"“To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear"
7009,III.,Once more that silent tongue.”
7010,III.,"Bal.  Let me beg you, sir,"
7011,III.,Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.
7012,III.,"Let us go down, I pray you."
7013,III.,(Voice loudly) Say nay!—say nay!
7014,III.,Pol. (aside)  ’Tis strange!—’tis very strange—methought the
7015,III.,voice
7016,III.,"Chimed in with my desires, and bade me stay!"
7017,III.,(approaching the window.)
7018,III.,"Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay."
7019,III.,"Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,"
7020,III.,"Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make"
7021,III.,Apology unto the Duke for me;
7022,III.,I go not down to-night.
7023,III.,Bal.  Your lordship’s pleasure
7024,III.,"Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian."
7025,III.,"Pol.  Good-night, my friend, good-night."
7026,IV.,IV.
7027,IV.,The gardens of a Palace—Moonlight Lalage and Politian.
7028,IV.,Lalge.  And dost thou speak of love
7029,IV.,"To me, Politian?—dost thou speak of love"
7030,IV.,"To Lalage?—ah, woe—ah, woe is me!"
7031,IV.,This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!
7032,IV.,"Politian.  Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears"
7033,IV.,"Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—"
7034,IV.,"Be comforted! I know—I know it all,"
7035,IV.,"And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest"
7036,IV.,And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!
7037,IV.,"Thou askest me if I could speak of love,"
7038,IV.,"Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen."
7039,IV.,Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—
7040,IV.,Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.                    (kneeling.)
7041,IV.,"Sweet Lalage, I love thee—love thee—love thee;"
7042,IV.,Thro’ good and ill—thro’ weal and wo I love thee.
7043,IV.,"Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,"
7044,IV.,Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
7045,IV.,"Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,"
7046,IV.,Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
7047,IV.,Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?                 (arising.)
7048,IV.,Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes—
7049,IV.,Thy beauty and thy woes.
7050,IV.,"Lal.  Alas, proud Earl,"
7051,IV.,"Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!"
7052,IV.,"How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens"
7053,IV.,"Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,"
7054,IV.,Could the dishonored Lalage abide?
7055,IV.,"Thy wife, and with a tainted memory—"
7056,IV.,"MY seared and blighted name, how would it tally"
7057,IV.,"With the ancestral honors of thy house,"
7058,IV.,And with thy glory?
7059,IV.,Pol.  Speak not to me of glory!
7060,IV.,I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor
7061,IV.,The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
7062,IV.,Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?
7063,IV.,Do I not love—art thou not beautiful—
7064,IV.,What need we more? Ha! glory!—now speak not of it.
7065,IV.,By all I hold most sacred and most solemn—
7066,IV.,By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter—
7067,IV.,By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven—
7068,IV.,"There is no deed I would more glory in,"
7069,IV.,Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
7070,IV.,And trample it under foot. What matters it—
7071,IV.,"What matters it, my fairest, and my best,"
7072,IV.,That we go down unhonored and forgotten
7073,IV.,Into the dust—so we descend together.
7074,IV.,"Descend together—and then—and then, perchance—"
7075,IV.,"Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?"
7076,IV.,"Pol.  And then, perchance"
7077,IV.,"Arise together, Lalage, and roam"
7078,IV.,"The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,"
7079,IV.,And still—
7080,IV.,"Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?"
7081,IV.,Pol.  And still together—together.
7082,IV.,Lal.  Now Earl of Leicester!
7083,IV.,"Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts"
7084,IV.,I feel thou lovest me truly.
7085,IV.,"Pol.  Oh, Lalage!"
7086,IV.,(throwing himself upon his knee.)
7087,IV.,And lovest thou me?
7088,IV.,Lal.  Hist! hush! within the gloom
7089,IV.,Of yonder trees methought a figure passed—
7090,IV.,"A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless—"
7091,IV.,"Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless."
7092,IV.,(walks across and returns.)
7093,IV.,I was mistaken—’twas but a giant bough
7094,IV.,Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!
7095,IV.,Pol.  My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?
7096,IV.,"Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,"
7097,IV.,"Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,"
7098,IV.,Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
7099,IV.,Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs
7100,IV.,Throw over all things a gloom.
7101,IV.,Lal.  Politian!
7102,IV.,Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
7103,IV.,With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—
7104,IV.,Miraculously found by one of Genoa—
7105,IV.,A thousand leagues within the golden west?
7106,IV.,"A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,"
7107,IV.,"And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,"
7108,IV.,"And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds"
7109,IV.,Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe
7110,IV.,"Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter"
7111,IV.,In days that are to come?
7112,IV.,"Pol.  O, wilt thou—wilt thou"
7113,IV.,"Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou"
7114,IV.,"Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,"
7115,IV.,"And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all."
7116,IV.,"And life shall then be mine, for I will live"
7117,IV.,"For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be"
7118,IV.,No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys
7119,IV.,"Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope"
7120,IV.,Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
7121,IV.,"And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,"
7122,IV.,"My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,"
7123,IV.,"My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,"
7124,IV.,Fly thither with me?
7125,IV.,Lal.  A deed is to be done—
7126,IV.,Castiglione lives!
7127,IV.,Pol.  And he shall die!                                (exit)
7128,IV.,Lal. (after a pause.)  And—he—shall—die!—alas!
7129,IV.,Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
7130,IV.,Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!
7131,IV.,"Thou art not gone—thou are not gone, Politian!"
7132,IV.,"I feel thou art not gone—yet dare not look,"
7133,IV.,Lest I behold thee not; thou couldst not go
7134,IV.,"With those words upon thy lips—O, speak to me!"
7135,IV.,"And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,"
7136,IV.,"To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,"
7137,IV.,To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate
7138,IV.,My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone—
7139,IV.,O speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!
7140,IV.,"I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go."
7141,IV.,"Villain, thou art not gone—thou mockest me!"
7142,IV.,"And thus I clutch thee—thus!—He is gone, he is gone"
7143,IV.,Gone—gone. Where am I?—’tis well—’tis very well!
7144,IV.,"So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,"
7145,IV.,"’Tis well, ’tis very well—alas! alas!"
7146,V.,V.
7147,V.,The suburbs. Politian alone.
7148,V.,"Politian.  This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,"
7149,V.,And much I fear me ill—it will not do
7150,V.,"To die ere I have lived!—Stay, stay thy hand,"
7151,V.,"O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers"
7152,V.,"Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!"
7153,V.,"O pity me! let me not perish now,"
7154,V.,In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
7155,V.,Give me to live yet—yet a little while:
7156,V.,’Tis I who pray for life—I who so late
7157,V.,Demanded but to die!—what sayeth the Count?
7158,V.,Enter Baldazzar.
7159,V.,Baldazzar.  That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
7160,V.,Between the Earl Politian and himself.
7161,V.,He doth decline your cartel.
7162,V.,Pol.  What didst thou say?
7163,V.,"What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?"
7164,V.,With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
7165,V.,"Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,"
7166,V.,"Or one more worthy Italy, methinks"
7167,V.,No mortal eyes have seen!—what said the Count?
7168,V.,"Bal.  That he, Castiglione’ not being aware"
7169,V.,"Of any feud existing, or any cause"
7170,V.,"Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,"
7171,V.,Cannot accept the challenge.
7172,V.,Pol.  It is most true—
7173,V.,"All this is very true. When saw you, sir,"
7174,V.,"When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid"
7175,V.,"Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,"
7176,V.,A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free
7177,V.,From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?
7178,V.,"Bal.  No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:"
7179,V.,"The Count Castiglione will not fight,"
7180,V.,Having no cause for quarrel.
7181,V.,Pol.  Now this is true—
7182,V.,"All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,"
7183,V.,And I have not forgotten it—thou’lt do me
7184,V.,A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say
7185,V.,"Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,"
7186,V.,"Hold him a villain?—thus much, I prythee, say"
7187,V.,Unto the Count—it is exceeding just
7188,V.,He should have cause for quarrel.
7189,V.,Bal.  My lord!—my friend!—
7190,V.,Pol.  (aside.) ’Tis he!—he comes himself? (aloud) Thou reasonest
7191,V.,well.
7192,V.,I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message—
7193,V.,Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.
7194,V.,"Now prythee, leave me—hither doth come a person"
7195,V.,With whom affairs of a most private nature
7196,V.,I would adjust.
7197,V.,"Bal.  I go—to-morrow we meet,"
7198,V.,Do we not?—at the Vatican.
7199,V.,Pol.  At the Vatican.                                     (exit
7200,V.,Bal.)
7201,V.,Enter Castigilone.
7202,V.,Cas.  The Earl of Leicester here!
7203,V.,"Pol.  I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,"
7204,V.,Dost thou not? that I am here.
7205,V.,"Cas.  My lord, some strange,"
7206,V.,Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—
7207,V.,Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
7208,V.,"Thereby, in heat of anger, to address"
7209,V.,"Some words most unaccountable, in writing,"
7210,V.,"To me, Castiglione; the bearer being"
7211,V.,"Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware"
7212,V.,"Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,"
7213,V.,Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?
7214,V.,’Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all
7215,V.,Do err at times.
7216,V.,"Pol.  Draw, villain, and prate no more!"
7217,V.,"Cas.  Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,"
7218,V.,Proud Earl!                                   (draws.)
7219,V.,"Pol.  (drawing.)  Thus to the expiatory tomb,"
7220,V.,"Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee"
7221,V.,In the name of Lalage!
7222,V.,Cas.  (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the
7223,V.,stage)
7224,V.,Of Lalage!
7225,V.,"Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!"
7226,V.,Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.
7227,V.,"Pol.  Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?"
7228,V.,Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;
7229,V.,Didst say thou darest not? Ha!
7230,V.,Cas.  I dare not—dare not—
7231,V.,Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name
7232,V.,So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—
7233,V.,I cannot—dare not.
7234,V.,Pol.  Now by my halidom
7235,V.,"I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!"
7236,V.,Cas.  Ha!—coward!—this may not be!
7237,V.,"(clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN, but his purpose"
7238,V.,"is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of"
7239,V.,the Earl)
7240,V.,"Alas! my lord,"
7241,V.,It is—it is—most true. In such a cause
7242,V.,I am the veriest coward. O pity me!
7243,V.,Pol.  (greatly softened.)  Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.
7244,V.,Cas.  And Lalage—
7245,V.,Pol.  Scoundrel!—arise and die!
7246,V.,Cas.  It needeth not be—thus—thus—O let me die
7247,V.,Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
7248,V.,That in this deep humiliation I perish.
7249,V.,For in the fight I will not raise a hand
7250,V.,"Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—"
7251,V.,(baring his bosom.)
7252,V.,Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon—
7253,V.,Strike home. I will not fight thee.
7254,V.,"Pol.  Now, s’ Death and Hell!"
7255,V.,Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted
7256,V.,"To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir,"
7257,V.,Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
7258,V.,For public insult in the streets—before
7259,V.,The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee
7260,V.,Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee
7261,V.,Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest—
7262,V.,"Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,—I’ll taunt thee,"
7263,V.,Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?
7264,V.,Thou liest! thou shalt!                                      (exit.)
7265,V.,Cas.  Now this indeed is just!

7273,NOTE,"light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,"
7274,NOTE,"1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an"
7275,NOTE,"unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845"
7276,NOTE,"collection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft"
7277,NOTE,"subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not"
7278,NOTE,considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty
7279,NOTE,and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;
7280,NOTE,"and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his"
7281,NOTE,"reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the"
7282,NOTE,following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The
7283,NOTE,"Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of"
7284,NOTE,Castiglione her betrothed.
7285,NOTE,
7286,NOTE,Duke. Why do you laugh?
7287,NOTE,Castiglione. Indeed
7288,NOTE,I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not
7289,NOTE,On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?
7290,NOTE,Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.
7291,NOTE,"Alessandra, you and 1, you must remember!"
7292,NOTE,We were walking in the garden.
7293,NOTE,"Duke, Perfectly."
7294,NOTE,I do remember it-what of it-what then?
7295,NOTE,Cas. O nothing-nothing at all.
7296,NOTE,Duke. Nothing at all!
7297,NOTE,It is most singular that you should laugh
7298,NOTE,‘At nothing at all!
7299,NOTE,Cas. Most singular-singular!
7300,NOTE,"Duke. Look you, Castiglione, be so kind"
7301,NOTE,"As tell me, sir, at once what ’tis you mean."
7302,NOTE,What are you talking of?
7303,NOTE,Cas. Was it not so?
7304,NOTE,We differed in opinion touching him.
7305,NOTE,Duke. Him!—Whom?
7306,NOTE,"Cas. Why, sir, the Earl Politian."
7307,NOTE,Duke. The Earl of Leicester! Yes!—is it he you mean?
7308,NOTE,"We differed, indeed. If I now recollect"
7309,NOTE,The words you used were that the Earl you knew
7310,NOTE,Was neither learned nor mirthful.
7311,NOTE,Cas. Ha! ha!—now did I?
7312,NOTE,"Duke. That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time"
7313,NOTE,"You were wrong, it being not the character"
7314,NOTE,Of the Earl-whom all the world allows to be
7315,NOTE,"A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,"
7316,NOTE,Too positive again.
7317,NOTE,Cas. ’Tis singular!
7318,NOTE,Most singular! I could not think it possible
7319,NOTE,So little time could so much alter one!
7320,NOTE,"To say the truth about an hour ago,"
7321,NOTE,"As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,"
7322,NOTE,"All arm in arm, we met this very man"
7323,NOTE,"The Earl-he, with his friend Baldazzar,"
7324,NOTE,Having just arrived in Rome. Hal ha! he is altered!
7325,NOTE,Such an account he gave me of his journey!
7326,NOTE,’Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told
7327,NOTE,Of his caprices and his merry freaks
7328,NOTE,Along the road-such oddity-such humor—
7329,NOTE,Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment
7330,NOTE,Set off too in such full relief by the grave
7331,NOTE,"Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth,"
7332,NOTE,Was gravity itself—
7333,NOTE,Duke. Did I not tell you?
7334,NOTE,"Cas. You did-and yet ’tis strange! but true as strange,"
7335,NOTE,How much I was mistaken! I always thought
7336,NOTE,The Earl a gloomy man.
7337,NOTE,"Duke. So, so, you see! Be not too positive. Whom have we here?"
7338,NOTE,It can not be the Earl?
7339,NOTE,"Cas. The Earl! Oh, no! ’Tis not the Earl-but yet it is-and leaning"

7400,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“Dear B...... Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy
7401,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to include in the
7402,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined
7403,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have
7404,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now omitted, whole lines,"
7405,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the"
7406,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some"

7409,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who
7410,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and _mine _of"
7411,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the"
7412,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few"
7413,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion"
7414,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,"
7415,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet"
7416,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge
7417,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ The"
7418,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’
7419,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man"
7420,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it"
7421,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for"
7422,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read"
7423,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of"
7424,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far"
7425,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean"
7426,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means"
7427,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never"
7428,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great
7429,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion."
7430,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","_This neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one"
7431,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel"
7432,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands"
7433,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",upon the pinnacle.
7434,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7435,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He
7436,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of"
7437,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or
7438,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in"
7439,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,"
7440,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a"
7441,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops
7442,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic"
7443,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many"
7444,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",letters of recommendation.
7445,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7446,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the
7447,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is
7448,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would
7449,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I"
7450,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his"
7451,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not,"
7452,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","I think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on"
7453,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate
7454,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false"
7455,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply"
7456,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many"
7457,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but
7458,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",his opinion with respect to the ‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly
7459,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert
7460,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended
7461,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","to posterity. But, in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all,"
7462,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","inferior to the ‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men"
7463,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading"
7464,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the"
7465,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",first to derive any pleasure from the second.
7466,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7467,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.
7468,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7469,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon"
7470,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is
7471,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been"
7472,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation"
7473,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The
7474,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but,"
7475,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled."
7476,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7477,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most"
7478,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce
7479,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or"
7480,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence"
7481,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence,"
7482,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness."
7483,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is
7484,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be
7485,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the
7486,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",reverse.
7487,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7488,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance"
7489,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and"
7490,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means
7491,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",of obtaining.
7492,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7493,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves"
7494,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to"
7495,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for"
7496,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment;
7497,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are"
7498,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in"
7499,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of
7500,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo"
7501,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any"
7502,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.
7503,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7504,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it
7505,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",becomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest.
7506,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in
7507,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and
7508,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their"
7509,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my"
7510,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect"
7511,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",with the passions-or age with poetry.

7516,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,"
7517,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies
7518,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces
7519,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding—the
7520,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon
7521,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral
7522,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of
7523,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",a man.
7524,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7525,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia"
7526,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","Literaria’—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact,"
7527,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",a treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _He goes wrong by
7528,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in"
7529,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely
7530,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who"
7531,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is
7532,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.
7533,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7534,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the"
7535,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in
7536,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _El Dorado)-but
7537,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at"
7538,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few"
7539,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.
7540,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7541,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end
7542,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light
7543,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is
7544,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany would
7545,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their"
7546,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might"
7547,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of
7548,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",vigor.
7549,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7550,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",“The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration
7551,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such"
7552,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—‘Of
7553,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done,"
7554,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing
7555,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been done before, no"
7556,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act,"
7557,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pickpocket,"
7558,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William"

7560,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",
7561,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","“Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian’s"
7562,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to"
7563,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the"
7564,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",controversy. _Tantaene animis? _Can great minds descend to such
7565,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor
7566,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his"
7567,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the
7568,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in
7569,"“WEST POINT, 1831.",light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads
7570,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","in the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is"
7571,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the author of"
7572,"“WEST POINT, 1831.","‘Peter Bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. We shall see what"

8154,PART I.,A gazer on the lights that shine above—
8155,PART I.,A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
8156,PART I.,"What wonder?  For each star is eye-like there,"
8157,PART I.,And looks so sweetly down on Beauty’s hair—
8158,PART I.,"And they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy"

8164,PART I.,Here sate he with his love—his dark eye bent
8165,PART I.,With eagle gaze along the firmament:
8166,PART I.,Now turn’d it upon her—but ever then
8167,PART I.,It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.
8168,PART I.,"“Iante, dearest, see!  how dim that ray!"

8176,PART I.,On th’Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
8177,PART I.,"Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall—"
8178,PART I.,And on my eye-lids—O the heavy light!
8179,PART I.,How drowsily it weigh’d them into night!
8180,PART I.,"On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran"
8181,PART I.,With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
8182,PART I.,"But O that light!—I slumber’d—Death, the while,"
8183,PART I.,Stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle
8184,PART I.,So softly that no single silken hair
8185,PART I.,Awoke that slept—or knew that it was there.
8186,PART I.,The last spot of Earth’s orb I trod upon
8187,PART I.,*Was a proud temple call’d the Parthenon—
8188,PART I.,More beauty clung around her column’d wall
8189,PART I.,"**Than ev’n thy glowing bosom beats withal,"
8190,PART I.,And when old Time my wing did disenthral
8191,PART I.,"Thence sprang I—as the eagle from his tower,"
8192,PART I.,And years I left behind me in an hour.
8193,PART I.,What time upon her airy bounds I hung
8194,PART I.,One half the garden of her globe was flung

8196,PART I.,Tenantless cities of the desert too!

8211,PART I.,"And roll’d, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart."
8212,PART I.,"Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar"
8213,PART I.,"And fell—not swiftly as I rose before,"
8214,PART I.,"But with a downward, tremulous motion thro’"
8215,PART I.,"Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!"
8216,PART I.,"Nor long the measure of my falling hours,"
8217,PART I.,For nearest of all stars was thine to ours—

8227,PART I.,Never his fairy wing o’er fairer world!
8228,PART I.,"Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes"
8229,PART I.,"Alone could see the phantom in the skies,"
8230,PART I.,When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
8231,PART I.,Headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea—
8232,PART I.,"But when its glory swell’d upon the sky,"
8233,PART I.,"As glowing Beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye,"
8234,PART I.,* Pennon—for pinion.—_Milton_.
8235,PART I.,"We paus’d before the heritage of men,"
8236,PART I.,And thy star trembled—as doth Beauty then!”
8237,PART I.,"Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away"
8238,PART I.,The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
8239,PART I.,They fell:  for Heaven to them no hope imparts

8246,TAMERLANE,
8247,TAMERLANE,
8248,TAMERLANE,Kind solace in a dying hour!
8249,TAMERLANE,"Such, father, is not (now) my theme—"
8250,TAMERLANE,I will not madly deem that power
8251,TAMERLANE,Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
8252,TAMERLANE,Unearthly pride hath revell’d in—
8253,TAMERLANE,I have no time to dote or dream:
8254,TAMERLANE,You call it hope—that fire of fire!
8255,TAMERLANE,It is but agony of desire:
8256,TAMERLANE,If I _can_ hope—Oh God! I can—
8257,TAMERLANE,Its fount is holier—more divine—
8258,TAMERLANE,"I would not call thee fool, old man,"
8259,TAMERLANE,But such is not a gift of thine.
8260,TAMERLANE,Know thou the secret of a spirit
8261,TAMERLANE,Bow’d from its wild pride into shame.
8262,TAMERLANE,O! yearning heart! I did inherit
8263,TAMERLANE,"Thy withering portion with the fame,"
8264,TAMERLANE,The searing glory which hath shone
8265,TAMERLANE,"Amid the jewels of my throne,"
8266,TAMERLANE,Halo of Hell! and with a pain
8267,TAMERLANE,Not Hell shall make me fear again—
8268,TAMERLANE,"O! craving heart, for the lost flowers"
8269,TAMERLANE,And sunshine of my summer hours!
8270,TAMERLANE,"Th’ undying voice of that dead time,"
8271,TAMERLANE,"With its interminable chime,"
8272,TAMERLANE,"Rings, in the spirit of a spell,"
8273,TAMERLANE,Upon thy emptiness—a knell.
8274,TAMERLANE,I have not always been as now:
8275,TAMERLANE,The fever’d diadem on my brow
8276,TAMERLANE,I claim’d and won usurpingly—
8277,TAMERLANE,Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
8278,TAMERLANE,Rome to the Caesar—this to me?
8279,TAMERLANE,"The heritage of a kingly mind,"
8280,TAMERLANE,And a proud spirit which hath striven
8281,TAMERLANE,Triumphantly with human kind.
8282,TAMERLANE,On mountain soil I first drew life:
8283,TAMERLANE,The mists of the Taglay have shed
8284,TAMERLANE,"Nightly their dews upon my head,"
8285,TAMERLANE,"And, I believe, the wingèd strife"
8286,TAMERLANE,And tumult of the headlong air
8287,TAMERLANE,Have nestled in my very hair.
8288,TAMERLANE,So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell
8289,TAMERLANE,(’Mid dreams of an unholy night)
8290,TAMERLANE,"Upon me—with the touch of Hell,"
8291,TAMERLANE,While the red flashing of the light
8292,TAMERLANE,"From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,"
8293,TAMERLANE,Appeared to my half-closing eye
8294,TAMERLANE,"The pageantry of monarchy,"
8295,TAMERLANE,And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar
8296,TAMERLANE,"Came hurriedly upon me, telling"
8297,TAMERLANE,"Of human battle, where my voice,"
8298,TAMERLANE,"My own voice, silly child!—was swelling"
8299,TAMERLANE,"(O! how my spirit would rejoice,"
8300,TAMERLANE,And leap within me at the cry)
8301,TAMERLANE,The battle-cry of Victory!
8302,TAMERLANE,The rain came down upon my head
8303,TAMERLANE,Unshelter’d—and the heavy wind
8304,TAMERLANE,"Was giantlike—so thou, my mind!—"
8305,TAMERLANE,"It was but man, I thought, who shed"
8306,TAMERLANE,Laurels upon me: and the rush—
8307,TAMERLANE,The torrent of the chilly air
8308,TAMERLANE,Gurgled within my ear the crush
8309,TAMERLANE,Of empires—with the captive’s prayer—
8310,TAMERLANE,The hum of suitors—and the tone
8311,TAMERLANE,Of flattery ‘round a sovereign’s throne.
8312,TAMERLANE,"My passions, from that hapless hour,"
8313,TAMERLANE,Usurp’d a tyranny which men
8314,TAMERLANE,"Have deem’d, since I have reach’d to power;"
8315,TAMERLANE,My innate nature—be it so:
8316,TAMERLANE,"But, father, there liv’d one who, then,"
8317,TAMERLANE,Then—in my boyhood—when their fire
8318,TAMERLANE,"Burn’d with a still intenser glow,"
8319,TAMERLANE,"(For passion must, with youth, expire)"
8320,TAMERLANE,E’en _then_ who knew this iron heart
8321,TAMERLANE,In woman’s weakness had a part.
8322,TAMERLANE,I have no words—alas!—to tell
8323,TAMERLANE,The loveliness of loving well!
8324,TAMERLANE,Nor would I now attempt to trace
8325,TAMERLANE,The more than beauty of a face
8326,TAMERLANE,"Whose lineaments, upon my mind,"
8327,TAMERLANE,Are—shadows on th’ unstable wind:
8328,TAMERLANE,Thus I remember having dwelt
8329,TAMERLANE,"Some page of early lore upon,"
8330,TAMERLANE,"With loitering eye, till I have felt"
8331,TAMERLANE,The letters—with their meaning—melt
8332,TAMERLANE,To fantasies—with none.
8333,TAMERLANE,"O, she was worthy of all love!"
8334,TAMERLANE,Love—as in infancy was mine—
8335,TAMERLANE,’Twas such as angel minds above
8336,TAMERLANE,Might envy; her young heart the shrine
8337,TAMERLANE,On which my ev’ry hope and thought
8338,TAMERLANE,"Were incense—then a goodly gift,"
8339,TAMERLANE,For they were childish—and upright—
8340,TAMERLANE,Pure—as her young example taught:
8341,TAMERLANE,"Why did I leave it, and, adrift,"
8342,TAMERLANE,"Trust to the fire within, for light?"
8343,TAMERLANE,"We grew in age—and love—together,"
8344,TAMERLANE,"Roaming the forest, and the wild;"
8345,TAMERLANE,My breast her shield in wintry weather—
8346,TAMERLANE,"And, when the friendly sunshine smil’d,"
8347,TAMERLANE,"And she would mark the opening skies,"
8348,TAMERLANE,_I_ saw no Heaven—but in her eyes.
8349,TAMERLANE,Young Love’s first lesson is—the heart:
8350,TAMERLANE,"For ‘mid that sunshine, and those smiles,"
8351,TAMERLANE,"When, from our little cares apart,"
8352,TAMERLANE,"And laughing at her girlish wiles,"
8353,TAMERLANE,"I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,"
8354,TAMERLANE,And pour my spirit out in tears—
8355,TAMERLANE,There was no need to speak the rest—
8356,TAMERLANE,No need to quiet any fears
8357,TAMERLANE,"Of her—who ask’d no reason why,"
8358,TAMERLANE,But turn’d on me her quiet eye!
8359,TAMERLANE,Yet _more_ than worthy of the love
8360,TAMERLANE,"My spirit struggled with, and strove,"
8361,TAMERLANE,"When, on the mountain peak, alone,"
8362,TAMERLANE,Ambition lent it a new tone—
8363,TAMERLANE,I had no being—but in thee:
8364,TAMERLANE,"The world, and all it did contain"
8365,TAMERLANE,In the earth—the air—the sea—
8366,TAMERLANE,Its joy—its little lot of pain
8367,TAMERLANE,"That was new pleasure—the ideal,"
8368,TAMERLANE,"Dim, vanities of dreams by night—"
8369,TAMERLANE,And dimmer nothings which were real—
8370,TAMERLANE,(Shadows—and a more shadowy light!)
8371,TAMERLANE,"Parted upon their misty wings,"
8372,TAMERLANE,"And, so, confusedly, became"
8373,TAMERLANE,"Thine image, and—a name—a name!"
8374,TAMERLANE,Two separate—yet most intimate things.
8375,TAMERLANE,I was ambitious—have you known
8376,TAMERLANE,"The passion, father? You have not:"
8377,TAMERLANE,"A cottager, I mark’d a throne"
8378,TAMERLANE,"Of half the world as all my own,"
8379,TAMERLANE,And murmur’d at such lowly lot—
8380,TAMERLANE,"But, just like any other dream,"
8381,TAMERLANE,Upon the vapour of the dew
8382,TAMERLANE,"My own had past, did not the beam"
8383,TAMERLANE,Of beauty which did while it thro’
8384,TAMERLANE,The minute—the hour—the day—oppress
8385,TAMERLANE,My mind with double loveliness.
8386,TAMERLANE,We walk’d together on the crown
8387,TAMERLANE,Of a high mountain which look’d down
8388,TAMERLANE,Afar from its proud natural towers
8389,TAMERLANE,"Of rock and forest, on the hills—"
8390,TAMERLANE,The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
8391,TAMERLANE,And shouting with a thousand rills.
8392,TAMERLANE,"I spoke to her of power and pride,"
8393,TAMERLANE,But mystically—in such guise
8394,TAMERLANE,That she might deem it naught beside
8395,TAMERLANE,The moment’s converse; in her eyes
8396,TAMERLANE,"I read, perhaps too carelessly—"
8397,TAMERLANE,A mingled feeling with my own—
8398,TAMERLANE,"The flush on her bright cheek, to me"
8399,TAMERLANE,Seem’d to become a queenly throne
8400,TAMERLANE,Too well that I should let it be
8401,TAMERLANE,Light in the wilderness alone.
8402,TAMERLANE,"I wrapp’d myself in grandeur then,"
8403,TAMERLANE,And donn’d a visionary crown—
8404,TAMERLANE,Yet it was not that Fantasy
8405,TAMERLANE,Had thrown her mantle over me—
8406,TAMERLANE,"But that, among the rabble—men,"
8407,TAMERLANE,Lion ambition is chain’d down—
8408,TAMERLANE,And crouches to a keeper’s hand—
8409,TAMERLANE,Not so in deserts where the grand
8410,TAMERLANE,The wild—the terrible conspire
8411,TAMERLANE,With their own breath to fan his fire.
8412,TAMERLANE,Look ‘round thee now on Samarcand!—
8413,TAMERLANE,Is not she queen of Earth? her pride
8414,TAMERLANE,Above all cities? in her hand
8415,TAMERLANE,Their destinies? in all beside
8416,TAMERLANE,Of glory which the world hath known
8417,TAMERLANE,Stands she not nobly and alone?
8418,TAMERLANE,Falling—her veriest stepping-stone
8419,TAMERLANE,Shall form the pedestal of a throne—
8420,TAMERLANE,And who her sovereign? Timour—he
8421,TAMERLANE,Whom the astonished people saw
8422,TAMERLANE,Striding o’er empires haughtily
8423,TAMERLANE,A diadem’d outlaw—
8424,TAMERLANE,"O! human love! thou spirit given,"
8425,TAMERLANE,"On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!"
8426,TAMERLANE,Which fall’st into the soul like rain
8427,TAMERLANE,"Upon the Siroc wither’d plain,"
8428,TAMERLANE,And failing in thy power to bless
8429,TAMERLANE,But leav’st the heart a wilderness!
8430,TAMERLANE,Idea! which bindest life around
8431,TAMERLANE,With music of so strange a sound
8432,TAMERLANE,And beauty of so wild a birth—
8433,TAMERLANE,Farewell! for I have won the Earth!
8434,TAMERLANE,"When Hope, the eagle that tower’d, could see"
8435,TAMERLANE,"No cliff beyond him in the sky,"
8436,TAMERLANE,His pinions were bent droopingly—
8437,TAMERLANE,And homeward turn’d his soften’d eye.
8438,TAMERLANE,’Twas sunset: when the sun will part
8439,TAMERLANE,There comes a sullenness of heart
8440,TAMERLANE,To him who still would look upon
8441,TAMERLANE,The glory of the summer sun.
8442,TAMERLANE,"That soul will hate the ev’ning mist,"
8443,TAMERLANE,"So often lovely, and will list"
8444,TAMERLANE,To the sound of the coming darkness (known
8445,TAMERLANE,To those whose spirits hearken) as one
8446,TAMERLANE,"Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly"
8447,TAMERLANE,But _cannot_ from a danger nigh.
8448,TAMERLANE,What tho’ the moon—tho’ the white moon
8449,TAMERLANE,"Shed all the splendour of her noon,"
8450,TAMERLANE,"_Her_ smile is chilly—and _her_ beam,"
8451,TAMERLANE,"In that time of dreariness, will seem"
8452,TAMERLANE,(So like you gather in your breath)
8453,TAMERLANE,A portrait taken after death.
8454,TAMERLANE,And boyhood is a summer sun
8455,TAMERLANE,Whose waning is the dreariest one—
8456,TAMERLANE,"For all we live to know is known,"
8457,TAMERLANE,And all we seek to keep hath flown—
8458,TAMERLANE,"Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall"
8459,TAMERLANE,With the noon-day beauty—which is all.
8460,TAMERLANE,I reach’d my home—my home no more—
8461,TAMERLANE,For all had flown who made it so—
8462,TAMERLANE,"I pass’d from out its mossy door,"
8463,TAMERLANE,"And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,"
8464,TAMERLANE,A voice came from the threshold stone
8465,TAMERLANE,Of one whom I had earlier known—
8466,TAMERLANE,"O! I defy thee, Hell, to show"
8467,TAMERLANE,"On beds of fire that burn below,"
8468,TAMERLANE,A humbler heart—a deeper woe.
8469,TAMERLANE,"Father, I firmly do believe—"
8470,TAMERLANE,"I _know_—for Death, who comes for me"
8471,TAMERLANE,"From regions of the blest afar,"
8472,TAMERLANE,"Where there is nothing to deceive,"
8473,TAMERLANE,"Hath left his iron gate ajar,"
8474,TAMERLANE,And rays of truth you cannot see
8475,TAMERLANE,Are flashing thro’ Eternity—
8476,TAMERLANE,I do believe that Eblis hath
8477,TAMERLANE,A snare in ev’ry human path—
8478,TAMERLANE,"Else how, when in the holy grove"
8479,TAMERLANE,"I wandered of the idol, Love,"
8480,TAMERLANE,Who daily scents his snowy wings
8481,TAMERLANE,With incense of burnt offerings
8482,TAMERLANE,"From the most unpolluted things,"
8483,TAMERLANE,Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
8484,TAMERLANE,Above with trelliced rays from Heaven
8485,TAMERLANE,No mote may shun—no tiniest fly
8486,TAMERLANE,The light’ning of his eagle eye—
8487,TAMERLANE,"How was it that Ambition crept,"
8488,TAMERLANE,"Unseen, amid the revels there,"
8489,TAMERLANE,"Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt"
8490,TAMERLANE,In the tangles of Love’s very hair?

9167,NOTES,includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was
9168,NOTES,"subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published"
9169,NOTES,volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised
9170,NOTES,"versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”"
9171,NOTES,"first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and"
9172,NOTES,"is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however,"
9173,NOTES,"this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following"
9174,NOTES,"twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in—all subsequent"

9183,AL AARAAF,Of thee will I write;
9184,AL AARAAF,Meantime from afar
9185,AL AARAAF,Bathe me in light I
9186,AL AARAAF,"Thy world has not the dross of ours,"
9187,AL AARAAF,Yet all the beauty-all the flowers
9188,AL AARAAF,That list our love or deck our bowers
9189,AL AARAAF,"In dreamy gardens, where do lie"
9190,AL AARAAF,Dreamy maidens all the day;
9191,AL AARAAF,While the silver winds of Circassy
9192,AL AARAAF,On violet couches faint away.
9193,AL AARAAF,Little—oh “little dwells in thee”
9194,AL AARAAF,Like unto what on earth we see:
9195,AL AARAAF,Beauty’s eye is here the bluest
9196,AL AARAAF,In the falsest and untruest—On the sweetest
9197,AL AARAAF,air doth float
9198,AL AARAAF,The most sad and solemn note—
9199,AL AARAAF,"If with thee be broken hearts,"
9200,AL AARAAF,"Joy so peacefully departs,"
9201,AL AARAAF,"That its echo still doth dwell,"
9202,AL AARAAF,Like the murmur in the shell.
9203,AL AARAAF,Thou! thy truest type of grief
9204,AL AARAAF,Is the gently falling leaf!
9205,AL AARAAF,Thy framing is so holy
9206,AL AARAAF,Sorrow is not melancholy.

9209,AL AARAAF,"volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now"
9210,AL AARAAF,"published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and"
9211,AL AARAAF,"improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the"

9216,AL AARAAF,"of Unrest” (as “The Valley Nis”), “Israfel,” and one or two others of the"
9217,AL AARAAF,"youthful pieces. The poem styled “Romance,” constituted the Preface of the"
9218,AL AARAAF,"1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:"
9219,AL AARAAF,
9220,AL AARAAF,"Succeeding years, too wild for song,"
9221,AL AARAAF,"Then rolled like tropic storms along,"
9222,AL AARAAF,"Where, through the garish lights that fly"
9223,AL AARAAF,"Dying along the troubled sky,"
9224,AL AARAAF,"Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,"
9225,AL AARAAF,"The blackness of the general Heaven,"
9226,AL AARAAF,That very blackness yet doth Ring
9227,AL AARAAF,Light on the lightning’s silver wing.
9228,AL AARAAF,For being an idle boy lang syne;
9229,AL AARAAF,"Who read Anacreon and drank wine,"
9230,AL AARAAF,I early found Anacreon rhymes
9231,AL AARAAF,Were almost passionate sometimes—
9232,AL AARAAF,And by strange alchemy of brain
9233,AL AARAAF,His pleasures always turned to pain—
9234,AL AARAAF,His naiveté to wild desire—
9235,AL AARAAF,His wit to love-his wine to fire—
9236,AL AARAAF,"And so, being young and dipt in folly,"
9237,AL AARAAF,"I fell in love with melancholy,"
9238,AL AARAAF,And used to throw my earthly rest
9239,AL AARAAF,And quiet all away in jest—
9240,AL AARAAF,I could not love except where Death
9241,AL AARAAF,Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath—
9242,AL AARAAF,"Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,"
9243,AL AARAAF,Were stalking between her and me.
9244,AL AARAAF,
9245,AL AARAAF,But now my soul hath too much room—
9246,AL AARAAF,Gone are the glory and the gloom—
9247,AL AARAAF,"The black hath mellow’d into gray,"
9248,AL AARAAF,And all the fires are fading away.
9249,AL AARAAF,My draught of passion hath been deep—
9250,AL AARAAF,"I revell’d, and I now would sleep"
9251,AL AARAAF,And after drunkenness of soul
9252,AL AARAAF,Succeeds the glories of the bowl
9253,AL AARAAF,An idle longing night and day
9254,AL AARAAF,To dream my very life away.
9255,AL AARAAF,"But dreams—of those who dream as I,"
9256,AL AARAAF,"Aspiringly, are damned, and die:"
9257,AL AARAAF,"Yet should I swear I mean alone,"
9258,AL AARAAF,"By notes so very shrilly blown,"
9259,AL AARAAF,"To break upon Time’s monotone,"
9260,AL AARAAF,While yet my vapid joy and grief
9261,AL AARAAF,Are tintless of the yellow leaf—
9262,AL AARAAF,"Why not an imp the graybeard hath,"
9263,AL AARAAF,Will shake his shadow in my path—
9264,AL AARAAF,And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook

9284,ALONE,My heart to joy at the same tone—
9285,ALONE,And all I lov’d—_I_ lov’d alone—
9286,ALONE,_Then_—in my childhood—in the dawn
9287,ALONE,Of a most stormy life—was drawn
9288,ALONE,From ev’ry depth of good and ill
9289,ALONE,The mystery which binds me still—
9290,ALONE,"From the torrent, or the fountain—"
9291,ALONE,From the red cliff of the mountain—
9292,ALONE,From the sun that ‘round me roll’d
9293,ALONE,In its autumn tint of gold—
9294,ALONE,From the lightning in the sky
9295,ALONE,As it pass’d me flying by—
9296,ALONE,"From the thunder, and the storm—"
9297,ALONE,And the cloud that took the form
9298,ALONE,(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
9299,ALONE,Of a demon in my view—

9312,I,"Beneath the vine-clad eaves,"
9313,I,Whose shadows fall before
9314,I,Thy lowly cottage door
9315,I,Under the lilac’s tremulous leaves—
9316,I,Within thy snowy claspeèd hand
9317,I,The purple flowers it bore.
9318,I,"Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,"
9319,I,Like queenly nymphs from Fairy-land—
9320,I,"Enchantress of the flowery wand,"
9321,I,Most beauteous Isadore!
9322,II,II
9323,II,And when I bade the dream
9324,II,"Upon thy spirit flee,"
9325,II,Thy violet eyes to me
9326,II,"Upturned, did overflowing seem"
9327,II,"With the deep, untold delight"
9328,II,Of Love’s serenity;
9329,II,"Thy classic brow, like lilies white"
9330,II,And pale as the Imperial Night
9331,II,"Upon her throne, with stars bedight,"
9332,II,Enthralled my soul to thee!
9333,III,III
9334,III,Ah I ever I behold
9335,III,"Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,"
9336,III,Blue as the languid skies
9337,III,Hung with the sunset’s fringe of gold;
9338,III,"Now strangely clear thine image grows,"
9339,III,And olden memories
9340,III,Are startled from their long repose
9341,III,Like shadows on the silent snows
9342,III,When suddenly the night-wind blows
9343,III,Where quiet moonlight ties.
9344,IV,IV
9345,IV,"Like music heard in dreams,"
9346,IV,"Like strains of harps unknown,"

9348,IV,Audible as the voice of streams
9349,IV,"That murmur in some leafy dell,"
9350,IV,"I hear thy gentlest tone,"
9351,IV,And Silence cometh with her spell
9352,IV,"Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,"
9353,IV,When tremulous in dreams I tell
9354,IV,My love to thee alone!

9356,V,"In every valley heard,"
9357,V,"Floating from tree to tree,"
9358,V,"Less beautiful to, me,"
9359,V,"The music of the radiant bird,"
9360,V,Than artless accents such as thine
9361,V,Whose echoes never flee!
9362,V,Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:—
9363,V,For uttered in thy tones benign
9364,V,(Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
9365,V,Doth seem a melody!

9373,THE VILLAGE STREET,"In these rapid, restless shadows,"
9374,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Once I walked at eventide,"
9375,THE VILLAGE STREET,"When a gentle, silent maiden,"
9376,THE VILLAGE STREET,Wal    ked in beauty at my side
9377,THE VILLAGE STREET,She alone there walked beside me
9378,THE VILLAGE STREET,"All in beauty, like a bride."
9379,THE VILLAGE STREET,Pallidly the moon was shining
9380,THE VILLAGE STREET,On the dewy meadows nigh;
9381,THE VILLAGE STREET,"On the silvery, silent rivers,"
9382,THE VILLAGE STREET,On the mountains far and high
9383,THE VILLAGE STREET,"On the ocean’s star-lit waters,"
9384,THE VILLAGE STREET,Where the winds a-weary die.
9385,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Slowly, silently we wandered"
9386,THE VILLAGE STREET,"From the open cottage door,"
9387,THE VILLAGE STREET,Underneath the elm’s long branches
9388,THE VILLAGE STREET,To the pavement bending o’er;
9389,THE VILLAGE STREET,Underneath the mossy willow
9390,THE VILLAGE STREET,And the dying sycamore.
9391,THE VILLAGE STREET,With the myriad stars in beauty
9392,THE VILLAGE STREET,"All bedight, the heavens were seen,"
9393,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Radiant hopes were bright around me,"
9394,THE VILLAGE STREET,Like the light of stars serene;
9395,THE VILLAGE STREET,Like the mellow midnight splendor
9396,THE VILLAGE STREET,Of the Night’s irradiate queen.
9397,THE VILLAGE STREET,Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
9398,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Peaceful, pleasant melodies,"
9399,THE VILLAGE STREET,Like the distant murmured music
9400,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Of unquiet, lovely seas:"
9401,THE VILLAGE STREET,While the winds were hushed in slumber
9402,THE VILLAGE STREET,In the fragrant flowers and trees.
9403,THE VILLAGE STREET,Wondrous and unwonted beauty
9404,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Still adorning all did seem,"
9405,THE VILLAGE STREET,While I told my love in fables
9406,THE VILLAGE STREET,‘Neath the willows by the stream;
9407,THE VILLAGE STREET,Would the heart have kept unspoken
9408,THE VILLAGE STREET,Love that was its rarest dream!
9409,THE VILLAGE STREET,Instantly away we wandered
9410,THE VILLAGE STREET,"In the shadowy twilight tide,"
9411,THE VILLAGE STREET,"She, the silent, scornful maiden,"
9412,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Walking calmly at my side,"
9413,THE VILLAGE STREET,"With a step serene and stately,"
9414,THE VILLAGE STREET,"All in beauty, all in pride."
9415,THE VILLAGE STREET,Vacantly I walked beside her.
9416,THE VILLAGE STREET,On the earth mine eyes were cast;
9417,THE VILLAGE STREET,Swift and keen there came unto me
9418,THE VILLAGE STREET,Ritter memories of the past
9419,THE VILLAGE STREET,"On me, like the rain in Autumn"
9420,THE VILLAGE STREET,"On the dead leaves, cold and fast."
9421,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Underneath the elms we parted,"
9422,THE VILLAGE STREET,By the lowly cottage door;
9423,THE VILLAGE STREET,One brief word alone was uttered
9424,THE VILLAGE STREET,Never on our lips before;
9425,THE VILLAGE STREET,"And away I walked forlornly,"
9426,THE VILLAGE STREET,Broken-hearted evermore.
9427,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Slowly, silently I loitered,"
9428,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Homeward, in the night, alone;"
9429,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Sudden anguish bound my spirit,"
9430,THE VILLAGE STREET,That my youth had never known;
9431,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Wild unrest, like that which cometh"
9432,THE VILLAGE STREET,When the Night’s first dream hath flown.
9433,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper"
9434,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Mad, discordant melodies,"
9435,THE VILLAGE STREET,And keen melodies like shadows
9436,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Haunt the moaning willow trees,"
9437,THE VILLAGE STREET,And the sycamores with laughter
9438,THE VILLAGE STREET,Mock me in the nightly breeze.
9439,THE VILLAGE STREET,Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
9440,THE VILLAGE STREET,Through the sighing foliage streams;
9441,THE VILLAGE STREET,"And each morning, midnight shadow,"
9442,THE VILLAGE STREET,Shadow of my sorrow seems;
9443,THE VILLAGE STREET,"Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!"
9444,THE VILLAGE STREET,"And, O soul, forget thy dreams!"

9455,THE FOREST REVERIE,"And hoary trees with groans of woe,"
9456,THE FOREST REVERIE,"Like warriors by an unknown foe,"
9457,THE FOREST REVERIE,"Were in their strength subdued,"
9458,THE FOREST REVERIE,The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
9459,THE FOREST REVERIE,To springs that ne’er did flow
9460,THE FOREST REVERIE,"That in the sun Did rivulets run,"

9493,NOTES,"Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe, and"
9494,NOTES,"not included among his known writings, the lines entitled “Alone” have the"
9495,NOTES,chief claim to our notice. _Fac-simile _copies of this piece had been
9496,NOTES,in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication
9497,NOTES,"in “Scribner’s Magazine” for September, 1875; but as proofs of the"
9498,NOTES,"authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from"
9499,NOTES,"publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been adduced,"
9500,NOTES,"and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us."
9501,NOTES,“Alone” is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore
9502,NOTES,"lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the facsimile given in"
9503,NOTES,“Scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be
9504,NOTES,"Poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many"
9505,NOTES,"specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the"
9506,NOTES,"heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the"
9507,NOTES,"poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not"
9508,NOTES,"by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made"
9509,NOTES,"public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not"
9510,NOTES,unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.”
9511,NOTES,
9512,NOTES,"While Edgar Poe was editor of the “Broadway Journal,” some lines “To"
9513,NOTES,"Isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no"
9514,NOTES,"signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy"
9515,NOTES,"questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were"
9516,NOTES,"by “A. Ide, junior.” Two previous poems had appeared in the “Broadway"
9517,NOTES,"journal” over the signature of “A. M. Ide,” and whoever wrote them was"
9518,NOTES,"also the author of the lines “To Isadore.” In order, doubtless, to give a"
9519,NOTES,"show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his"
9520,NOTES,"journal over _noms de plume, _and as no other writings whatever can"
9521,NOTES,"be traced to any person bearing the name of “A. M. Ide,” it is not"
9522,NOTES,impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the
9523,NOTES,author of “The Raven.” Having been published without his usual elaborate
9524,NOTES,"revision, Poe may have wished to _hide _his hasty work under an"
9525,NOTES,"assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so"
9526,NOTES,the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by
9527,NOTES,the author of “The Raven.”
