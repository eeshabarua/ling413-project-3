80,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,"THE piping of our slender, peaceful reeds"
81,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,Whispers uncared for while the trumpets bray;
82,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,Song is thin air; our hearts' exulting play
83,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,"Beats time but to the tread of marching deeds,"
84,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,"Following the mighty van that Freedom leads,"
85,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,Her glorious standard flaming to the day!
86,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,The crimsoned pavement where a hero bleeds
87,BROTHER JONATHAN'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE,Breathes nobler lessons than the poet's lay.

113,AGNES,
114,AGNES,The story of Sir Harry Frankland and Agnes Surriage is told in the
115,AGNES,ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts. These were obtained
116,AGNES,"from information afforded me by the Rev. Mr. Webster, of Hopkinton, in"
117,AGNES,"company with whom I visited the Frankland Mansion in that town, then"
118,AGNES,"standing; from a very interesting Memoir, by the Rev. Elias Nason, of"
119,AGNES,"Medford; and from the manuscript diary of Sir Harry, or more properly"
120,AGNES,"Sir Charles Henry Frankland, now in the library of the Massachusetts"
121,AGNES,Historical Society.
122,AGNES,
123,AGNES,"At the time of the visit referred to, old Julia was living, and on our"
124,AGNES,return we called at the house where she resided.--[She was living June
125,AGNES,"10, 1861, when this ballad was published]--Her account is little more"
126,AGNES,than paraphrased in the poem. If the incidents are treated with a
127,AGNES,"certain liberality at the close of the fifth part, the essential fact"
128,AGNES,"that Agnes rescued Sir Harry from the ruins after the earthquake, and"
129,AGNES,"their subsequent marriage as related, may be accepted as literal truth."
130,AGNES,So with regard to most of the trifling details which are given; they are
131,AGNES,taken from the record. It is greatly to be regretted that the Frankland
132,AGNES,Mansion no longer exists. It was accidentally burned on the 23d of
133,AGNES,"January, 1858, a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was"
134,AGNES,written. A visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the
135,AGNES,"years before the Revolution. A new house, similar in plan and"
136,AGNES,"arrangements to the old one, has been built upon its site, and the"
137,AGNES,"terraces, the clump of box, and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear"
138,AGNES,witness to the truth of this story.
139,AGNES,
140,AGNES,"The story, which I have told literally in rhyme, has been made"
141,AGNES,the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by Mr.
142,AGNES,E. L. Bynner.

149,THE KNIGHT,
150,THE KNIGHT,"THE tale I tell is gospel true,"
151,THE KNIGHT,"As all the bookmen know,"
152,THE KNIGHT,And pilgrims who have strayed to view
153,THE KNIGHT,The wrecks still left to show.
154,THE KNIGHT,
155,THE KNIGHT,"The old, old story,--fair, and young,"
156,THE KNIGHT,"And fond,--and not too wise,--"
157,THE KNIGHT,"That matrons tell, with sharpened tongue,"
158,THE KNIGHT,To maids with downcast eyes.
159,THE KNIGHT,
160,THE KNIGHT,Ah! maidens err and matrons warn
161,THE KNIGHT,Beneath the coldest sky;
162,THE KNIGHT,Love lurks amid the tasselled corn
163,THE KNIGHT,As in the bearded rye!
164,THE KNIGHT,
165,THE KNIGHT,But who would dream our sober sires
166,THE KNIGHT,"Had learned the old world's ways,"
167,THE KNIGHT,And warmed their hearths with lawless fires
168,THE KNIGHT,In Shirley's homespun days?
169,THE KNIGHT,
170,THE KNIGHT,'T is like some poet's pictured trance
171,THE KNIGHT,"His idle rhymes recite,--"
172,THE KNIGHT,This old New England-born romance
173,THE KNIGHT,Of Agnes and the Knight;
174,THE KNIGHT,
175,THE KNIGHT,"Yet, known to all the country round,"
176,THE KNIGHT,"Their home is standing still,"
177,THE KNIGHT,Between Wachusett's lonely mound
178,THE KNIGHT,And Shawmut's threefold hill.
179,THE KNIGHT,
180,THE KNIGHT,"One hour we rumble on the rail,"
181,THE KNIGHT,"One half-hour guide the rein,"
182,THE KNIGHT,"We reach at last, o'er hill and dale,"
183,THE KNIGHT,The village on the plain.
184,THE KNIGHT,
185,THE KNIGHT,"With blackening wall and mossy roof,"
186,THE KNIGHT,"With stained and warping floor,"
187,THE KNIGHT,A stately mansion stands aloof
188,THE KNIGHT,And bars its haughty door.
189,THE KNIGHT,
190,THE KNIGHT,"This lowlier portal may be tried,"
191,THE KNIGHT,That breaks the gable wall;
192,THE KNIGHT,"And lo! with arches opening wide,"
193,THE KNIGHT,Sir Harry Frankland's hall!
194,THE KNIGHT,
195,THE KNIGHT,'T was in the second George's day
196,THE KNIGHT,"They sought the forest shade,"
197,THE KNIGHT,"The knotted trunks they cleared away,"
198,THE KNIGHT,"The massive beams they laid,"
199,THE KNIGHT,
200,THE KNIGHT,"They piled the rock-hewn chimney tall,"
201,THE KNIGHT,"They smoothed the terraced ground,"
202,THE KNIGHT,They reared the marble-pillared wall
203,THE KNIGHT,That fenced the mansion round.
204,THE KNIGHT,
205,THE KNIGHT,Far stretched beyond the village bound
206,THE KNIGHT,The Master's broad domain;
207,THE KNIGHT,"With page and valet, horse and hound,"
208,THE KNIGHT,He kept a goodly train.
209,THE KNIGHT,
210,THE KNIGHT,"And, all the midland county through,"
211,THE KNIGHT,The ploughman stopped to gaze
212,THE KNIGHT,Whene'er his chariot swept in view
213,THE KNIGHT,"Behind the shining bays,"
214,THE KNIGHT,
215,THE KNIGHT,"With mute obeisance, grave and slow,"
216,THE KNIGHT,"Repaid by nod polite,--"
217,THE KNIGHT,For such the way with high and low
218,THE KNIGHT,Till after Concord fight.
219,THE KNIGHT,
220,THE KNIGHT,Nor less to courtly circles known
221,THE KNIGHT,That graced the three-hilled town
222,THE KNIGHT,"With far-off splendors of the Throne,"
223,THE KNIGHT,And glimmerings from the Crown;
224,THE KNIGHT,
225,THE KNIGHT,"Wise Phipps, who held the seals of state"
226,THE KNIGHT,For Shirley over sea;
227,THE KNIGHT,"Brave Knowles, whose press-gang moved of late"
228,THE KNIGHT,The King Street mob's decree;
229,THE KNIGHT,
230,THE KNIGHT,"And judges grave, and colonels grand,"
231,THE KNIGHT,"Fair dames and stately men,"
232,THE KNIGHT,"The mighty people of the land,"
233,THE KNIGHT,"The ""World"" of there and then."
234,THE KNIGHT,
235,THE KNIGHT,"'T was strange no Chloe's ""beauteous Form,"""
236,THE KNIGHT,"And ""Eyes' celestial Blew,"""
237,THE KNIGHT,"This Strephon of the West could warm,"
238,THE KNIGHT,No Nymph his Heart subdue.
239,THE KNIGHT,
240,THE KNIGHT,"Perchance he wooed as gallants use,"
241,THE KNIGHT,"Whom fleeting loves enchain,"
242,THE KNIGHT,"But still unfettered, free to choose,"
243,THE KNIGHT,Would brook no bridle-rein.
244,THE KNIGHT,
245,THE KNIGHT,"He saw the fairest of the fair,"
246,THE KNIGHT,But smiled alike on all;
247,THE KNIGHT,"No band his roving foot might snare,"
248,THE KNIGHT,No ring his hand enthrall.

254,THE MAIDEN,THE MAIDEN
255,THE MAIDEN,
256,THE MAIDEN,Why seeks the knight that rocky cape
257,THE MAIDEN,Beyond the Bay of Lynn?
258,THE MAIDEN,What chance his wayward course may shape
259,THE MAIDEN,To reach its village inn?
260,THE MAIDEN,
261,THE MAIDEN,"No story tells; whate'er we guess,"
262,THE MAIDEN,"The past lies deaf and still,"
263,THE MAIDEN,"But Fate, who rules to blight or bless,"
264,THE MAIDEN,Can lead us where she will.
265,THE MAIDEN,
266,THE MAIDEN,"Make way! Sir Harry's coach and four,"
267,THE MAIDEN,And liveried grooms that ride!
268,THE MAIDEN,"They cross the ferry, touch the shore"
269,THE MAIDEN,On Winnisimmet's side.
270,THE MAIDEN,
271,THE MAIDEN,"They hear the wash on Chelsea Beach,--"
272,THE MAIDEN,"The level marsh they pass,"
273,THE MAIDEN,Where miles on miles the desert reach
274,THE MAIDEN,Is rough with bitter grass.
275,THE MAIDEN,
276,THE MAIDEN,"The shining horses foam and pant,"
277,THE MAIDEN,And now the smells begin
278,THE MAIDEN,"Of fishy Swampscott, salt Nahant,"
279,THE MAIDEN,And leather-scented Lynn.
280,THE MAIDEN,
281,THE MAIDEN,"Next, on their left, the slender spires"
282,THE MAIDEN,And glittering vanes that crown
283,THE MAIDEN,"The home of Salem's frugal sires,"
284,THE MAIDEN,"The old, witch-haunted town."
285,THE MAIDEN,
286,THE MAIDEN,"So onward, o'er the rugged way"
287,THE MAIDEN,"That runs through rocks and sand,"
288,THE MAIDEN,"Showered by the tempest-driven spray,"
289,THE MAIDEN,"From bays on either hand,"
290,THE MAIDEN,
291,THE MAIDEN,That shut between their outstretched arms
292,THE MAIDEN,"The crews of Marblehead,"
293,THE MAIDEN,"The lords of ocean's watery farms,"
294,THE MAIDEN,Who plough the waves for bread.
295,THE MAIDEN,
296,THE MAIDEN,"At last the ancient inn appears,"
297,THE MAIDEN,"The spreading elm below,"
298,THE MAIDEN,Whose flapping sign these fifty years
299,THE MAIDEN,Has seesawed to and fro.
300,THE MAIDEN,
301,THE MAIDEN,How fair the azure fields in sight
302,THE MAIDEN,Before the low-browed inn
303,THE MAIDEN,The tumbling billows fringe with light
304,THE MAIDEN,The crescent shore of Lynn;
305,THE MAIDEN,
306,THE MAIDEN,Nahant thrusts outward through the waves
307,THE MAIDEN,"Her arm of yellow sand,"
308,THE MAIDEN,And breaks the roaring surge that braves
309,THE MAIDEN,The gauntlet on her hand;
310,THE MAIDEN,
311,THE MAIDEN,With eddying whirl the waters lock
312,THE MAIDEN,"Yon treeless mound forlorn,"
313,THE MAIDEN,"The sharp-winged sea-fowl's breeding-rock,"
314,THE MAIDEN,That fronts the Spouting Horn;
315,THE MAIDEN,
316,THE MAIDEN,"Then free the white-sailed shallops glide,"
317,THE MAIDEN,"And wide the ocean smiles,"
318,THE MAIDEN,"Till, shoreward bent, his streams divide"
319,THE MAIDEN,The two bare Misery Isles.
320,THE MAIDEN,
321,THE MAIDEN,The master's silent signal stays
322,THE MAIDEN,The wearied cavalcade;
323,THE MAIDEN,The coachman reins his smoking bays
324,THE MAIDEN,Beneath the elm-tree's shade.
325,THE MAIDEN,
326,THE MAIDEN,A gathering on the village green!
327,THE MAIDEN,"The cocked-hats crowd to see,"
328,THE MAIDEN,"On legs in ancient velveteen,"
329,THE MAIDEN,With buckles at the knee.
330,THE MAIDEN,
331,THE MAIDEN,A clustering round the tavern-door
332,THE MAIDEN,"Of square-toed village boys,"
333,THE MAIDEN,"Still wearing, as their grandsires wore,"
334,THE MAIDEN,The old-world corduroys!
335,THE MAIDEN,
336,THE MAIDEN,"A scampering at the ""Fountain"" inn,---"
337,THE MAIDEN,"A rush of great and small,--"
338,THE MAIDEN,With hurrying servants' mingled din
339,THE MAIDEN,And screaming matron's call.
340,THE MAIDEN,
341,THE MAIDEN,Poor Agnes! with her work half done
342,THE MAIDEN,They caught her unaware;
343,THE MAIDEN,"As, humbly, like a praying nun,"
344,THE MAIDEN,She knelt upon the stair;
345,THE MAIDEN,
346,THE MAIDEN,"Bent o'er the steps, with lowliest mien"
347,THE MAIDEN,"She knelt, but not to pray,--"
348,THE MAIDEN,"Her little hands must keep them clean,"
349,THE MAIDEN,And wash their stains away.
350,THE MAIDEN,
351,THE MAIDEN,"A foot, an ankle, bare and white,"
352,THE MAIDEN,"Her girlish shapes betrayed,--"
353,THE MAIDEN,"""Ha! Nymphs and Graces!"" spoke the Knight;"
354,THE MAIDEN,"""Look up, my beauteous Maid!"""
355,THE MAIDEN,
356,THE MAIDEN,"She turned,--a reddening rose in bud,"
357,THE MAIDEN,"Its calyx half withdrawn,--"
358,THE MAIDEN,Her cheek on fire with damasked blood
359,THE MAIDEN,Of girlhood's glowing dawn!
360,THE MAIDEN,
361,THE MAIDEN,"He searched her features through and through,"
362,THE MAIDEN,As royal lovers look
363,THE MAIDEN,"On lowly maidens, when they woo"
364,THE MAIDEN,Without the ring and book.
365,THE MAIDEN,
366,THE MAIDEN,"""Come hither, Fair one! Here, my Sweet!"
367,THE MAIDEN,"Nay, prithee, look not down!"
368,THE MAIDEN,"Take this to shoe those little feet,""--"
369,THE MAIDEN,He tossed a silver crown.
370,THE MAIDEN,
371,THE MAIDEN,"A sudden paleness struck her brow,--"
372,THE MAIDEN,A swifter blush succeeds;
373,THE MAIDEN,It burns her cheek; it kindles now
374,THE MAIDEN,Beneath her golden beads.
375,THE MAIDEN,
376,THE MAIDEN,"She flitted, but the glittering eye"
377,THE MAIDEN,Still sought the lovely face.
378,THE MAIDEN,"Who was she? What, and whence? and why"
379,THE MAIDEN,Doomed to such menial place?
380,THE MAIDEN,
381,THE MAIDEN,"A skipper's daughter,--so they said,--"
382,THE MAIDEN,Left orphan by the gale
383,THE MAIDEN,That cost the fleet of Marblehead
384,THE MAIDEN,And Gloucester thirty sail.
385,THE MAIDEN,
386,THE MAIDEN,Ah! many a lonely home is found
387,THE MAIDEN,"Along the Essex shore,"
388,THE MAIDEN,"That cheered its goodman outward bound,"
389,THE MAIDEN,And sees his face no more!
390,THE MAIDEN,
391,THE MAIDEN,"""Not so,"" the matron whispered,--""sure"
392,THE MAIDEN,"No orphan girl is she,--"
393,THE MAIDEN,The Surriage folk are deadly poor
394,THE MAIDEN,"Since Edward left the sea,"
395,THE MAIDEN,
396,THE MAIDEN,"""And Mary, with her growing brood,"
397,THE MAIDEN,Has work enough to do
398,THE MAIDEN,To find the children clothes and food
399,THE MAIDEN,"With Thomas, John, and Hugh."
400,THE MAIDEN,
401,THE MAIDEN,"""This girl of Mary's, growing tall,--"
402,THE MAIDEN,"(Just turned her sixteenth year,)--"
403,THE MAIDEN,"To earn her bread and help them all,"
404,THE MAIDEN,"Would work as housemaid here."""
405,THE MAIDEN,
406,THE MAIDEN,"So Agnes, with her golden beads,"
407,THE MAIDEN,"And naught beside as dower,"
408,THE MAIDEN,"Grew at the wayside with the weeds,"
409,THE MAIDEN,Herself a garden-flower.
410,THE MAIDEN,
411,THE MAIDEN,"'T was strange, 't was sad,--so fresh, so fair!"
412,THE MAIDEN,Thus Pity's voice began.
413,THE MAIDEN,Such grace! an angel's shape and air!
414,THE MAIDEN,The half-heard whisper ran.
415,THE MAIDEN,
416,THE MAIDEN,"For eyes could see in George's time,"
417,THE MAIDEN,"As now in later days,"
418,THE MAIDEN,"And lips could shape, in prose and rhyme,"
419,THE MAIDEN,The honeyed breath of praise.
420,THE MAIDEN,
421,THE MAIDEN,No time to woo! The train must go
422,THE MAIDEN,"Long ere the sun is down,"
423,THE MAIDEN,"To reach, before the night-winds blow,"
424,THE MAIDEN,The many-steepled town.
425,THE MAIDEN,
426,THE MAIDEN,"'T is midnight,--street and square are still;"
427,THE MAIDEN,Dark roll the whispering waves
428,THE MAIDEN,That lap the piers beneath the hill
429,THE MAIDEN,Ridged thick with ancient graves.
430,THE MAIDEN,
431,THE MAIDEN,"Ah, gentle sleep! thy hand will smooth"
432,THE MAIDEN,"The weary couch of pain,"
433,THE MAIDEN,When all thy poppies fail to soothe
434,THE MAIDEN,The lover's throbbing brain!
435,THE MAIDEN,
436,THE MAIDEN,"'T is morn,--the orange-mantled sun"
437,THE MAIDEN,"Breaks through the fading gray,"
438,THE MAIDEN,And long and loud the Castle gun
439,THE MAIDEN,Peals o'er the glistening bay.
440,THE MAIDEN,
441,THE MAIDEN,"""Thank God 't is day!"" With eager eye"
442,THE MAIDEN,He hails the morning shine:--
443,THE MAIDEN,"""If art can win, or gold can buy,"
444,THE MAIDEN,"The maiden shall be mine!"""

969,SPRING,WINTER is past; the heart of Nature warms
970,SPRING,Beneath the wrecks of unresisted storms;
971,SPRING,"Doubtful at first, suspected more than seen,"
972,SPRING,The southern slopes are fringed with tender green;
973,SPRING,"On sheltered banks, beneath the dripping eaves,"
974,SPRING,"Spring's earliest nurslings spread their glowing leaves,"
975,SPRING,"Bright with the hues from wider pictures won,"
976,SPRING,"White, azure, golden,--drift, or sky, or sun,--"
977,SPRING,"The snowdrop, bearing on her patient breast"
978,SPRING,The frozen trophy torn from Winter's crest;
979,SPRING,"The violet, gazing on the arch of blue"
980,SPRING,Till her own iris wears its deepened hue;
981,SPRING,"The spendthrift crocus, bursting through the mould"
982,SPRING,Naked and shivering with his cup of gold.
983,SPRING,"Swelled with new life, the darkening elm on high"
984,SPRING,Prints her thick buds against the spotted sky
985,SPRING,On all her boughs the stately chestnut cleaves
986,SPRING,The gummy shroud that wraps her embryo leaves;
987,SPRING,"The house-fly, stealing from his narrow grave,"
988,SPRING,"Drugged with the opiate that November gave,"
989,SPRING,"Beats with faint wing against the sunny pane,"
990,SPRING,"Or crawls, tenacious, o'er its lucid plain;"

992,SPRING,"In languid curves, the gliding serpent crawls;"

1003,SPRING,"O'er the soft meadows starred with opening buds,"
1004,SPRING,"In tears and blushes sighs herself away,"
1005,SPRING,And hides her cheek beneath the flowers of May.
1006,SPRING,

1020,SPRING,Then flash the wings returning Summer calls
1021,SPRING,"Through the deep arches of her forest halls,--"
1022,SPRING,"The bluebird, breathing from his azure plumes"
1023,SPRING,The fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms;
1024,SPRING,"The thrush, poor wanderer, dropping meekly down,"
1025,SPRING,Clad in his remnant of autumnal brown;
1026,SPRING,"The oriole, drifting like a flake of fire"
1027,SPRING,Rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire.
1028,SPRING,"The robin, jerking his spasmodic throat,"
1029,SPRING,"Repeats, imperious, his staccato note;"
1030,SPRING,"The crack-brained bobolink courts his crazy mate,"
1031,SPRING,Poised on a bulrush tipsy with his weight;
1032,SPRING,"Nay, in his cage the lone canary sings,"
1033,SPRING,"Feels the soft air, and spreads his idle wings."
1034,SPRING,
1035,SPRING,"Why dream I here within these caging walls,"
1036,SPRING,"Deaf to her voice, while blooming Nature calls;"
1037,SPRING,Peering and gazing with insatiate looks
1038,SPRING,"Through blinding lenses, or in wearying books?"
1039,SPRING,"Off, gloomy spectres of the shrivelled past!"
1040,SPRING,Fly with the leaves that fill the autumn blast
1041,SPRING,"Ye imps of Science, whose relentless chains"

1346,THE OLD PLAYER,THE curtain rose; in thunders long and loud
1347,THE OLD PLAYER,The galleries rung; the veteran actor bowed.
1348,THE OLD PLAYER,In flaming line the telltales of the stage
1349,THE OLD PLAYER,Showed on his brow the autograph of age;
1350,THE OLD PLAYER,"Pale, hueless waves amid his clustered hair,"
1351,THE OLD PLAYER,"And umbered shadows, prints of toil and care;"
1352,THE OLD PLAYER,"Round the wide circle glanced his vacant eye,--"
1353,THE OLD PLAYER,"He strove to speak,--his voice was but a sigh."
1354,THE OLD PLAYER,
1355,THE OLD PLAYER,Year after year had seen its short-lived race
1356,THE OLD PLAYER,Flit past the scenes and others take their place;
1357,THE OLD PLAYER,"Yet the old prompter watched his accents still,"
1358,THE OLD PLAYER,His name still flaunted on the evening's bill.
1359,THE OLD PLAYER,"Heroes, the monarchs of the scenic floor,"
1360,THE OLD PLAYER,Had died in earnest and were heard no more;
1361,THE OLD PLAYER,"Beauties, whose cheeks such roseate bloom o'er-spread"
1362,THE OLD PLAYER,"They faced the footlights in unborrowed red,"
1363,THE OLD PLAYER,Had faded slowly through successive shades
1364,THE OLD PLAYER,"To gray duennas, foils of younger maids;"
1365,THE OLD PLAYER,Sweet voices lost the melting tones that start
1366,THE OLD PLAYER,"With Southern throbs the sturdy Saxon heart,"
1367,THE OLD PLAYER,While fresh sopranos shook the painted sky
1368,THE OLD PLAYER,"With their long, breathless, quivering locust-cry."
1369,THE OLD PLAYER,"Yet there he stood,--the man of other days,"
1370,THE OLD PLAYER,"In the clear present's full, unsparing blaze,"
1371,THE OLD PLAYER,As on the oak a faded leaf that clings
1372,THE OLD PLAYER,While a new April spreads its burnished wings.
1373,THE OLD PLAYER,
1374,THE OLD PLAYER,"How bright yon rows that soared in triple tier,"
1375,THE OLD PLAYER,Their central sun the flashing chandelier!
1376,THE OLD PLAYER,How dim the eye that sought with doubtful aim
1377,THE OLD PLAYER,Some friendly smile it still might dare to claim
1378,THE OLD PLAYER,How fresh these hearts! his own how worn and cold!
1379,THE OLD PLAYER,Such the sad thoughts that long-drawn sigh had told.
1380,THE OLD PLAYER,No word yet faltered on his trembling tongue;
1381,THE OLD PLAYER,"Again, again, the crashing galleries rung."
1382,THE OLD PLAYER,As the old guardsman at the bugle's blast
1383,THE OLD PLAYER,"Hears in its strain the echoes of the past,"
1384,THE OLD PLAYER,"So, as the plaudits rolled and thundered round,"
1385,THE OLD PLAYER,A life of memories startled at the sound.
1386,THE OLD PLAYER,"He lived again,--the page of earliest days,--"
1387,THE OLD PLAYER,Days of small fee and parsimonious praise;
1388,THE OLD PLAYER,"Then lithe young Romeo--hark that silvered tone,"
1389,THE OLD PLAYER,From those smooth lips--alas! they were his own.
1390,THE OLD PLAYER,"Then the bronzed Moor, with all his love and woe,"
1391,THE OLD PLAYER,Told his strange tale of midnight melting snow;
1392,THE OLD PLAYER,"And dark--plumed Hamlet, with his cloak and blade,"
1393,THE OLD PLAYER,"Looked on the royal ghost, himself a shade."
1394,THE OLD PLAYER,"All in one flash, his youthful memories came,"
1395,THE OLD PLAYER,"Traced in bright hues of evanescent flame,"
1396,THE OLD PLAYER,"As the spent swimmer's in the lifelong dream,"
1397,THE OLD PLAYER,While the last bubble rises through the stream.
1398,THE OLD PLAYER,
1399,THE OLD PLAYER,"Call him not old, whose visionary brain"
1400,THE OLD PLAYER,Holds o'er the past its undivided reign.
1401,THE OLD PLAYER,For him in vain the envious seasons roll
1402,THE OLD PLAYER,Who bears eternal summer in his soul.
1403,THE OLD PLAYER,"If yet the minstrel's song, the poet's lay,"
1404,THE OLD PLAYER,"Spring with her birds, or children at their play,"
1405,THE OLD PLAYER,"Or maiden's smile, or heavenly dream of art,"
1406,THE OLD PLAYER,"Stir the few life-drops creeping round his heart,"
1407,THE OLD PLAYER,"Turn to the record where his years are told,--"
1408,THE OLD PLAYER,"Count his gray hairs,--they cannot make him old!"
1409,THE OLD PLAYER,What magic power has changed the faded mime?
1410,THE OLD PLAYER,One breath of memory on the dust of time.
1411,THE OLD PLAYER,As the last window in the buttressed wall
1412,THE OLD PLAYER,"Of some gray minster tottering to its fall,"
1413,THE OLD PLAYER,"Though to the passing crowd its hues are spread,"
1414,THE OLD PLAYER,"A dull mosaic, yellow, green, and red,"
1415,THE OLD PLAYER,"Viewed from within, a radiant glory shows"
1416,THE OLD PLAYER,"When through its pictured screen the sunlight flows,"
1417,THE OLD PLAYER,And kneeling pilgrims on its storied pane
1418,THE OLD PLAYER,See angels glow in every shapeless stain;
1419,THE OLD PLAYER,"So streamed the vision through his sunken eye,"
1420,THE OLD PLAYER,Clad in the splendors of his morning sky.
1421,THE OLD PLAYER,"All the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew,"
1422,THE OLD PLAYER,"All the young fancies riper years proved true,"
1423,THE OLD PLAYER,"The sweet, low-whispered words, the winning glance"
1424,THE OLD PLAYER,"From queens of song, from Houris of the dance,"
1425,THE OLD PLAYER,"Wealth's lavish gift, and Flattery's soothing phrase,"
1426,THE OLD PLAYER,"And Beauty's silence when her blush was praise,"
1427,THE OLD PLAYER,"And melting Pride, her lashes wet with tears,"
1428,THE OLD PLAYER,"Triumphs and banquets, wreaths and crowns and cheers,"
1429,THE OLD PLAYER,"Pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue,"
1430,THE OLD PLAYER,"And all that poets dream, but leave unsung!"
1431,THE OLD PLAYER,
1432,THE OLD PLAYER,In every heart some viewless founts are fed
1433,THE OLD PLAYER,From far-off hillsides where the dews were shed;
1434,THE OLD PLAYER,On the worn features of the weariest face
1435,THE OLD PLAYER,"Some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace,"
1436,THE OLD PLAYER,As in old gardens left by exiled kings
1437,THE OLD PLAYER,"The marble basins tell of hidden springs,"
1438,THE OLD PLAYER,"But, gray with dust, and overgrown with weeds,"
1439,THE OLD PLAYER,"Their choking jets the passer little heeds,"
1440,THE OLD PLAYER,"Till time's revenges break their seals away,"
1441,THE OLD PLAYER,"And, clad in rainbow light, the waters play."
1442,THE OLD PLAYER,
1443,THE OLD PLAYER,"Good night, fond dreamer! let the curtain fall"
1444,THE OLD PLAYER,"The world's a stage, and we are players all."
1445,THE OLD PLAYER,"A strange rehearsal! Kings without their crowns,"
1446,THE OLD PLAYER,"And threadbare lords, and jewel-wearing clowns,"
1447,THE OLD PLAYER,"Speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts,"
1448,THE OLD PLAYER,"As Want, stern prompter! spells them out their parts."
1449,THE OLD PLAYER,The tinselled hero whom we praise and pay
1450,THE OLD PLAYER,Is twice an actor in a twofold play.
1451,THE OLD PLAYER,We smile at children when a painted screen
1452,THE OLD PLAYER,Seems to their simple eyes a real scene;
1453,THE OLD PLAYER,"Ask the poor hireling, who has left his throne"
1454,THE OLD PLAYER,"To seek the cheerless home he calls his own,"
1455,THE OLD PLAYER,"Which of his double lives most real seems,"
1456,THE OLD PLAYER,The world of solid fact or scenic dreams?
1457,THE OLD PLAYER,"Canvas, or clouds,--the footlights, or the spheres,--"
1458,THE OLD PLAYER,"The play of two short hours, or seventy years?"
1459,THE OLD PLAYER,"Dream on! Though Heaven may woo our open eyes,"
1460,THE OLD PLAYER,Through their closed lids we look on fairer skies;
1461,THE OLD PLAYER,"Truth is for other worlds, and hope for this;"
1462,THE OLD PLAYER,The cheating future lends the present's bliss;
1463,THE OLD PLAYER,"Life is a running shade, with fettered hands,"
1464,THE OLD PLAYER,That chases phantoms over shifting sands;
1465,THE OLD PLAYER,"Death a still spectre on a marble seat,"
1466,THE OLD PLAYER,With ever clutching palms and shackled feet;
1467,THE OLD PLAYER,"The airy shapes that mock life's slender chain,"
1468,THE OLD PLAYER,"The flying joys he strives to clasp in vain,"
1469,THE OLD PLAYER,"Death only grasps; to live is to pursue,--"
1470,THE OLD PLAYER,Dream on! there 's nothing but illusion true!

1483,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",No sable car along the winding road
1484,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Has borne to earth its unresisting load;
1485,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",No sudden mound has risen yet to show

1487,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",No marble gleams to bid his memory live

1491,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
1492,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Fair is the scene; its sweetness oft beguiled
1493,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",From their dim paths the children of the wild;
1494,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The dark-haired maiden loved its grassy dells,"
1495,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells,"

1498,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil,--"
1499,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil!
1500,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store
1501,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Till the brown arms of Labor held no more;
1502,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The scythe's broad meadow with its dusky blush;
1503,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The sickle's harvest with its velvet flush;
1504,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The green-haired maize, her silken tresses laid,"
1505,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In soft luxuriance, on her harsh brocade;"
1506,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume;
1507,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom,--"
1508,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Its coral stems and milk-white flowers alive
1509,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",With the wide murmurs of the scattered hive;
1510,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak
1511,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Of morning painted on its southern cheek;
1512,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The pear's long necklace strung with golden drops,"
1513,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Arched, like the banian, o'er its pillared props;"
1514,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Here crept the growths that paid the laborer's care
1515,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",With the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare;
1516,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Here sprang the healing herbs which could not save
1517,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The hand that reared them from the neighboring grave.
1518,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
1519,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Yet all its varied charms, forever free"

1522,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The sower's hand shall cast its flying grain;
1523,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","No more, when Autumn strews the flaming leaves,"
1524,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The reaper's band shall gird its yellow sheaves;
1525,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",For thee alike the circling seasons flow
1526,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Till the first blossoms heave the latest snow.
1527,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In the stiff clod below the whirling drifts,"
1528,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In the loose soil the springing herbage lifts,"
1529,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In the hot dust beneath the parching weeds,"
1530,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Life's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds;

1536,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Come from the bowers where Summer's life-blood flows
1537,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Through the red lips of June's half-open rose,"
1538,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Dressed in bright hues, the loving sunshine's dower;"
1539,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",For tranquil Nature owns no mourning flower.
1540,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Come from the forest where the beech's screen

1542,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains,"
1543,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Stanch the deep wound That dries the maple's veins.

1549,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",From their twin thrones the Giants of the North
1550,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","On the huge shapes, that, crouching at their knees,"
1551,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Stretch their broad shoulders, rough with shaggy trees."
1552,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Through the wide waste of ether, not in vain,"

1555,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","On the blue mounds that print the bluer skies,"
1556,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Nature shall whisper that the fading view

1558,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Cherub of Wisdom! let thy marble page

1561,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","To the chill winds that waft us on to death,"

1566,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",While with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread
1567,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","That soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed,"
1568,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","With the low whisper,--Who shall first be laid"
1569,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",In the dark chamber's yet unbroken shade?--
1570,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Let thy sweet radiance shine rekindled here,"
1571,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",And all we cherish grow more truly dear.
1572,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Here in the gates of Death's o'erhanging vault,"

1574,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod,"
1575,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",And lead our hearts to Mercy and its God.
1576,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
1577,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",FATHER of all! in Death's relentless claim
1578,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",We read thy mercy by its sterner name;

1580,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",We see thy glory in its narrowed sphere;
1581,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In the deep lessons that affliction draws,"
1582,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",We trace the curves of thy encircling laws;
1583,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In the long sigh that sets our spirits free,"

1590,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Track the still burden, rolling slow before,"
1591,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",That love and kindness can protect no more;
1592,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The smiling babe that, called to mortal strife,"
1593,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life;
1594,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The drooping child who prays in vain to live,"
1595,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",And pleads for help its parent cannot give;
1596,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The pride of beauty stricken in its flower;
1597,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The strength of manhood broken in an hour;
1598,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Age in its weakness, bowed by toil and care,"
1599,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair.
1600,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
1601,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The sun shall set, and heaven's resplendent spheres"
1602,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Gild the smooth turf unhallowed yet by tears,"
1603,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",But ah! how soon the evening stars will shed
1604,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Their sleepless light around the slumbering dead!
1605,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
1606,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Take them, O Father, in immortal trust!"
1607,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Ashes to ashes, dust to kindred dust,"
