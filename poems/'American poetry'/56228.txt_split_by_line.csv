167,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,"Though brightest paths remain unknown,"
168,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,"And few the heights we tread,"
169,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,Though we must struggle on alone

177,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,"Perhaps they do, and yet,"
178,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,"Upon the darkest, dullest way"
179,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,How many flowers are met.
180,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,The happy hours so quickly flee
181,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,"We sigh to see them go,"
182,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,When out upon life's troubled sea
183,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,The moments move so slow.

186,_THE SWEETEST SONGS._,The sweetest themes unread?

218,_SEA AND CLIFF._,The lurid breakers dash in rifts of white
219,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Upon the reef, rebounding to the sky,"
220,_SEA AND CLIFF._,And yet by yonder point the trembling surf
221,_SEA AND CLIFF._,In distance dies; as darkness coils around
222,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Our rugged path we pause, each nerve alert."
223,_SEA AND CLIFF._,How grand the march majestic of the night
224,_SEA AND CLIFF._,Amid the raging tempest's grim display
225,_SEA AND CLIFF._,Of rain and hail and that too vivid flash
226,_SEA AND CLIFF._,Which makes the inky blackness more intense!
227,_SEA AND CLIFF._,But now the pall is riven and behold!
228,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"The beauteous sun, whose rich, prismatic glow"
229,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Illumes a jewelled curtain, poised thereon"
230,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"A rainbow plumed for flight, while earth lies wrapped"
231,_SEA AND CLIFF._,In golden glory. Many a sail full set
232,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Is homeward speeding, bearing happy hearts"
233,_SEA AND CLIFF._,To where love anxious waits and eager eyes
234,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Will sweetest welcome give. O, World rejoice!"
235,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Confronted by the swift incoming tide,"
236,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"With hurried step we scale the dizzy cliff,"
237,_SEA AND CLIFF._,"Delivered by the one all-potent hand,"
238,_SEA AND CLIFF._,That ever waits to still life's sternest storms.

248,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,Moments and months and days and years
249,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,Laden with hope and love and tears.
250,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,
251,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,Laden with hope that cheered the way
252,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"When earth lay wrapped in twilight gray,"
253,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"In twilight gray, till shining through"
254,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"The fair, sweet promise grew and grew."
255,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,
256,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"Fair, sweet promise of joy, of bliss,"
257,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"We should not, could not, would not, miss"
258,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"Of bliss so perfect, bliss so true,"
259,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,We fain would keep that bliss in view.
260,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,
261,_THE MARCH OF TIME._,"Steadily marching, swift or slow,"

272,_A GIFT._,"It was given him in youth,"
273,_A GIFT._,Bestowed by a kingly hand;
274,_A GIFT._,"Sweet as the flower of truth,"
275,_A GIFT._,When its first fair buds expand.
276,_A GIFT._,"It was given him to prize,"
277,_A GIFT._,To guard with a jealous care;
278,_A GIFT._,This gift in a humble guise
279,_A GIFT._,But precious beyond compare.
280,_A GIFT._,
281,_A GIFT._,It was given himâ€”he turned
282,_A GIFT._,"From promise so close concealed,"
283,_A GIFT._,Although in his soul he yearned
284,_A GIFT._,To follow the unrevealed.
285,_A GIFT._,He turned from a gift which came
286,_A GIFT._,"In the flush of boyhood days,"
287,_A GIFT._,It clung to him just the same
288,_A GIFT._,As he trod the world's wild maze.
289,_A GIFT._,
290,_A GIFT._,"It was given himâ€”it slept,"
291,_A GIFT._,But would not be cast aside;
292,_A GIFT._,Till into his heart it crept
293,_A GIFT._,A-quiver with love and pride.
294,_A GIFT._,"Yes, into his heart it crept,"
295,_A GIFT._,He worked with a new-born skill;
296,_A GIFT._,And whether he laughed or wept
297,_A GIFT._,He worked with a steadfast will.
298,_A GIFT._,
299,_A GIFT._,It was given himâ€”he caught
300,_A GIFT._,It close to his heaving breast
301,_A GIFT._,"And a miracle was wrought,"
302,_A GIFT._,For a genius stood confessed.
303,_A GIFT._,The gift which he held the least
304,_A GIFT._,Was the gift the Lord had sent;
305,_A GIFT._,"Lo, the angel at the feast"
306,_A GIFT._,"He had misnamed, discontent."
