246,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],It may be so--ere mighty Cæsar died
247,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Presaging Nature felt his doom, and sighed;"
248,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"A bellowing voice through midnight groves was heard,"
249,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],And threatening ghosts at dusk of eve appeared--
250,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Ere Brutus fell, to adverse fates a prey,                         15"
251,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"His evil genius met him on the way,"

254,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],Shame seize my crown ere such a deed be mine--
255,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"No--to the last my squadrons shall combine,                       20"
256,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And slay my foes, while foes remain to slay,"
257,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],Or heaven shall grant me one successful day.
258,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Is there a robber close in Newgate hemmed,"
259,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Is there a cut-throat, fettered and condemned?"
260,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Haste, loyal slaves, to George's standard come,                   25"
261,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],Attend his lectures when you hear the drum;
262,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Your chains I break--for better days prepare,"
263,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Come out, my friends, from prison and from care,"
264,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Far to the west I plan your desperate sway,"

266,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"There, without fear, your bloody aims pursue,"
267,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],And shew mankind what English thieves can do.
268,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"That day, when first I mounted to the throne,"
269,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],I swore to let all foreign foes alone.
270,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Through love of peace to terms did I advance,                     35"
271,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And made, they say, a shameful league with France.[2]"
272,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"But different scenes rise horrid to my view,"
273,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],I charged my hosts to plunder and subdue--
274,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"At first, indeed, I thought short wars to wage"
275,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And sent some jail-birds to be led by Gage,[3]                    40"
276,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"For 'twas but right, that those we marked for slaves"
277,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Should be reduced by cowards, fools, and knaves;"
278,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Awhile directed by his feeble hand,"
279,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Whose troops were kicked and pelted through the land,"
280,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Or starved in Boston, cursed the unlucky hour                     45"
281,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],They left their dungeons for that fatal shore.
282,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"France aids them now, a desperate game I play,"
283,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And hostile Spain will do the same, they say;"
284,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My armies vanquished, and my heroes fled,"
285,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My people murmuring, and my commerce dead,                        50"
286,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My shattered navy pelted, bruised, and clubbed,"
287,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"By Dutchmen bullied, and by Frenchmen drubbed,"
288,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My name abhorred, my nation in disgrace,"
289,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],How should I act in such a mournful case!
290,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My hopes and joys are vanished with my coin,                      55"
291,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"My ruined army, and my lost Burgoyne!"
292,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"What shall I do--confess my labours vain,"
293,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Or whet my tusks, and to the charge again!"
294,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"But where's my force--my choicest troops are fled,"
295,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Some thousands crippled, and a myriad dead--                      60"
296,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"If I were owned the boldest of mankind,"
297,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And hell with all her flames inspired my mind,"
298,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Could I at once with Spain and France contend,"
299,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],And fight the rebels on the world's green end?--
300,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"The pangs of parting I can ne'er endure,                          65"
301,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Yet part we must, and part to meet no more!"
302,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Oh, blast this Congress, blast each upstart State,"
303,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],On whose commands ten thousand captains wait;
304,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"From various climes that dire Assembly came,"
305,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"True to their trust, as hostile to my fame,                       70"
306,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"'Tis these, ah these, have ruined half my sway,"
307,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Disgraced my arms, and led my slaves astray--"
308,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Cursed be the day when first I saw the sun,"
309,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],Cursed be the hour when I these wars begun:
310,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"The fiends of darkness then possessed my mind,                    75"
311,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],And powers unfriendly to the human kind.
312,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"To wasting grief, and sullen rage a prey,"
313,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"To Scotland's utmost verge I'll take my way,"
314,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],There with eternal storms due concert keep
315,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"And while the billows rage, as fiercely weep--                    80"
316,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Ye highland lads, my rugged fate bemoan,"
317,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"Assist me with one sympathizing groan,[4]"
318,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"For late I find the nations are my foes,"
319,GEORGE THE THIRD'S SOLILOQUY[1],"I must submit, and that with bloody nose,"

837,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,_Amid these ills no tyrant dared refuse
838,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"My right to pen the dictates of the muse,"
839,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To paint the terrors of the infernal place,"
840,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And fiends from Europe, insolent as base._"
841,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,
842,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Assist me, Clio! while in verse I tell"
843,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The dire misfortunes that a ship befell,"
844,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Which outward bound, to St. Eustatia's shore,"
845,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Death and disaster through the billows bore.
846,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,From Philadelphia's crowded port she came;
847,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"For there the builder plann'd her lofty frame,"
848,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"With wond'rous skill, and excellence of art"
849,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"He form'd, dispos'd, and order'd every part,"
850,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,With joy beheld the stately fabric rise
851,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To a stout bulwark of stupendous size,"
852,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"'Till launch'd at last, capacious of the freight,"
853,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"He left her to the Pilots, and her fate."
854,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"First from her depths the tapering masts ascend,"
855,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"On whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend,"
856,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,By shrouds and stays secur'd from side to side
857,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Trees grew on trees, suspended o'er the tide,"
858,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Firm to the yards extended, broad and vast"
859,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"They hung the sails susceptive of the blast,"
860,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Far o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay,"
861,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Supporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay,"
862,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Twice ten six pounders at their port holes plac'd
863,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And rang'd in rows, stood hostile in the waist:"
864,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Thus all prepar'd, impatient for the seas,"
865,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"She left her station with an adverse breeze,"
866,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"This her first outset from her native shore,"
867,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To seas a stranger, and untry'd before."
868,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,From the bright radiance that his glories spread
869,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Ere from the east gay Phoebus lifts his head,"
870,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"From the sweet morn, a kindred name she won,"
871,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"_Aurora_ call'd, the offspring of the sun,"
872,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Whose form projecting, the broad prow displays,"
873,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Far glittering o'er the wave, a mimic blaze."
874,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The gay ship now, in all her pomp and pride,"
875,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"With sails expanded, flew along the tide;"
876,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware, that bore"
877,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"This pile intended for a southern shore,"
878,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns,"
879,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Fair fruits, gay blossoms, and enamell'd plains;"
880,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Where sloping lawns the roving swain invite,"
881,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night,"
882,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings
883,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And sky-topt mountains teem with golden springs.
884,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"From Cape Henlopen, urg'd by favouring gales,"
885,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"When morn emerg'd, we sea-ward spread our sails,"
886,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Then east-south-east explor'd the briny way,"
887,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Close to the wind, departing from the bay;"
888,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No longer seen the hoarse resounding strand,"
889,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"With hearts elate we hurried from the land,"
890,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Escap'd the dangers of that shelvy ground,"
891,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To sailors fatal, and for wrecks renown'd.--"
892,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The gale increases as we stem the main,"
893,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Now scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain,"
894,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,At last they sink beneath the rolling wave
895,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"That seems their summits, as they sink, to lave;"
896,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Abaft the beam the freshening breezes play,"
897,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No mists advancing to deform the day,"
898,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No tempests rising o'er the splendid scene,"
899,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"A sea unruffled, and a heaven serene."
900,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Now Sol's bright lamp, the heav'n born source of light,"
901,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Had pass'd the line of his meridian height,"
902,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And westward hung--retreating from the view
903,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Shores disappear'd, and every hill withdrew,"
904,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"When, still suspicious of some neighbouring foe,"
905,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Aloft the Master bade a Seaman go,"
906,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To mark if, from the mast's aspiring height"
907,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Through all the round a vessel came in sight.
908,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Too soon the Seaman's glance, extending wide,"
909,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Far distant in the east a ship espy'd,"
910,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale,"
911,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Close to the wind was brac'd each shivering sail;
912,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe,"
913,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Her spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow
914,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,When to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste
915,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And her lee-guns lay delug'd in the waste:
916,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,From her top-gallant flow'd an English Jack;
917,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"With all her might she strove to gain our track,"
918,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Nor strove in vain--with pride and power elate,"
919,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Wing'd on by hell, she drove us to our fate;"
920,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No stop no stay her bloody crew intends,"
921,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,(So flies a comet with its host of fiends)
922,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Nor oaths, nor prayers arrest her swift career,"
923,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Death in her front, and ruin in her rear."
924,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Struck at the sight, the Master gave command"
925,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To change our course, and steer toward the land--"
926,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Swift to the task the ready sailors run,"
927,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And while the word was utter'd, half was done:"
928,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,As from the south the fiercer breezes rise
929,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Swift from her foe alarm'd Aurora flies,"
930,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,With every sail extended to the wind
931,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,She fled the unequal foe that chac'd behind;
932,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Along her decks dispos'd in close array
933,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Each at its port, the grim artillery lay,"
934,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Soon on the foe with brazen throat to roar;
935,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"But, small their size, and narrow was their bore;"
936,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Yet faithful they their destin'd station keep
937,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"To guard the barque that wafts them o'er the deep,"
938,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Who now must bend to steer a homeward course
939,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And trust her swiftness rather than her force,"
940,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Unfit to combat with a powerful foe;
941,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Her decks too open, and her waist too low."
942,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"While o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,"
943,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Once more emerging, distant landscapes rise;"
944,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"High in the air the starry streamer plays,"
945,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And every sail its various tribute pays:
946,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,To gain the land we bore the weighty blast;
947,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And now the wish'd for cape appear'd at last;
948,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"But the vext foe, impatient of delay,"
949,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Prepar'd for ruin, press'd upon her prey;"
950,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Near, and more near, in aweful grandeur came"
951,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The frigate _Iris_, not unknown to fame;"
952,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"_Iris_ her name, but _Hancock_ once she bore,"
953,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Fram'd and completed on New Albion's shore,"
954,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"By Manly lost, the swiftest of the train"
955,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,That fly with wings of canvas o'er the main.
956,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Now, while for combat some with zeal prepare,"
957,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Thus to the heavens the Boatswain sent his prayer:
958,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""List, all ye powers that rule the skies and seas!"
959,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""Shower down perdition on such thieves as these,"
960,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""Fate, strike their hearts with terror and dismay,"
961,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""And sprinkle on their powder salt-sea spray!"
962,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""May bursting cannon, while his aim he tries,"
963,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""Destroy the Gunner, and be-damn his eyes--"
964,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""The chief who awes the quarter-deck, may he,"
965,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""Tripp'd from his stand, be tumbled in the sea."
966,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""May they who rule the round-top's giddy height"
967,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""Be canted headlong to perpetual night;"
968,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""May fiends torment them on a leeward coast,"
969,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""And help forsake them when they want it most--"
970,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""From their wheel'd engines torn be every gun--"
971,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""And now, to sum up every curse in one,"
972,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""May latent flames, to save us, intervene,"
973,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"""And hell-ward drive them from their magazine!""--"
974,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The Frigate now had every sail unfurl'd,"
975,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And rush'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world;
976,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Thus fierce Pelides, eager to destroy,"
977,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Chac'd the proud Trojan to the gates of Troy--
978,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Swift o'er the waves while hostile they pursue
979,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"As swiftly from their fangs _Aurora_ flew,"
980,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"At length Henlopen's cape we gain'd once more,"
981,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And vainly strove to force the ship ashore;
982,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Stern fate forbade the barren shore to gain,"
983,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Denial sad, and source of future pain!"
984,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"For then the inspiring breezes ceas'd to blow,"
985,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Lost were they all, and smooth the seas below;"
986,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"By the broad cape becalm'd, our lifeless sails"
987,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,No longer swell'd their bosoms to the gales;
988,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The ship, unable to pursue her way,"
989,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Tumbling about, at her own guidance lay,"
990,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No more the helm its wonted influence lends,"
991,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"No oars assist us, and no breeze befriends;"
992,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Meantime the foe, advancing from the sea,"
993,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Rang'd her black cannon, pointed on our lee,"
994,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Then up she luff'd, and blaz'd her entrails dire,"
995,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Bearing destruction, terror, death and fire."
996,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Vext at our fate, we prim'd a piece, and then"
997,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Return'd the shot, to shew them we were men."
998,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Dull night at length her dusky pinions spread,"
999,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,And every hope to 'scape the foe was fled;
1000,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Close to thy cape, Henlopen, though we press'd,"
1001,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"We could not gain thy desert, dreary breast;"
1002,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Though ruin'd trees beshroud thy barren shore
1003,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"With mounds of sand half hid, or cover'd o'er,"
1004,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Though ruffian winds disturb thy summit bare,"
1005,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Yet every hope and every wish was there;
1006,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"In vain we sought to reach the joyless strand,"
1007,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Fate stood between, and barr'd us from the land."
1008,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"All dead becalm'd, and helpless as we lay,"
1009,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The ebbing current forc'd us back to sea,"
1010,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"While vengeful _Iris_, thirsting for our blood,"
1011,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Flash'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood,"
1012,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,At every flash a storm of ruin came
1013,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,'Till our shock'd vessel shook through all her frame--
1014,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Mad for revenge, our breasts with fury glow"
1015,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,To wreak returns of vengeance on the foe;
1016,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Full at his hull our pointed guns we rais'd,"
1017,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,His hull resounded as the cannon blaz'd;
1018,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Through his main top-sail one a passage tore,"
1019,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"His sides re-echo'd to the dreadful roar,"
1020,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Alternate fires dispell'd the shades of night--
1021,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,But how unequal was this daring fight!
1022,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Our stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball,"
1023,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Twelve pounders from the foe our sides did maul,"
1024,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And, while no power to save him intervenes,"
1025,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,A bullet struck our captain of Marines;
1026,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Fierce, though he bid defiance to the foe"
1027,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"He felt his death and ruin in the blow,"
1028,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Headlong he fell, distracted with the wound,"
1029,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"The deck distain'd, and heart blood streaming round."
1030,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Another blast, as fatal in its aim,"
1031,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Wing'd by destruction, through our rigging came,"
1032,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"And, whistling tunes from hell upon its way,"
1033,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Shrouds, stays, and braces tore at once away,"
1034,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Sails, blocks, and oars in scatter'd fragments fly--"
1035,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,"Their softest language was--_submit, or die!_"
1036,CANTO I.--THE CAPTURE,Repeated cries throughout the ship resound;

1630,THE SPY[33],_Pasq._ And when the general gives a dance or an entertainment or a
1631,THE SPY[33],"ball, we see none of the true-heart Americans invited. His guests are a"
1632,THE SPY[33],"lukewarm, half-disaffected sort of people, who say more than for their"
1633,THE SPY[33],own sakes I would choose to mention to everybody.
1634,THE SPY[33],
1635,THE SPY[33],"_Jeff._ Well, this may all be true, and yet I cannot help thinking our"
1636,THE SPY[33],master is a hearty friend to his country. He does these things for a
1637,THE SPY[33],"feint, under a mask, as it were, to find out secrets from the enemy. In"
1638,THE SPY[33],"good faith, I am of opinion he will shortly drive every British soldier"
1639,THE SPY[33],"off the continent and then become possessed of his Lordship or Manor, or"
1640,THE SPY[33],what-so you call it.
1641,THE SPY[33],
1642,THE SPY[33],"_Pasq._ Amen, I say, and so let us work on in hopes of better times."
1643,THE SPY[33],
1644,THE SPY[33],
1645,THE SPY[33],SCENE II.--_Scene changes to New York._ SIR HENRY CLINTON _and_ MAJOR
1646,THE SPY[33],ANDRÉ _in a private apartment_.
1647,THE SPY[33],
1648,THE SPY[33],"_Sir Henry._ André, my friend and faithful confidant,"
1649,THE SPY[33],"Since Fortune now vouchsafes to smile again,"
1650,THE SPY[33],"And stubborn Charlestown bends to Britain's yoke,"
1651,THE SPY[33],What shall we next attempt or next achieve?
1652,THE SPY[33],I have transmitted home a full account
1653,THE SPY[33],"Of that great capture, that important city"
1654,THE SPY[33],"Which long has bid defiance to our arms,"
1655,THE SPY[33],With all particulars and circumstances
1656,THE SPY[33],"Attending on the siege, and in the list"
1657,THE SPY[33],"Of British officers with honour mentioned,"
1658,THE SPY[33],"You, sir, are not forgot. I must confess,"
1659,THE SPY[33],"By your advice I planned that expedition,"
1660,THE SPY[33],"Which now shall set me high in royal favor,"
1661,THE SPY[33],"By your unconquered spirit and perseverance,"
1662,THE SPY[33],"A mind that laughs at toils and difficulties,"
1663,THE SPY[33],I carried on the siege with fire and vigour
1664,THE SPY[33],"Against a foe with hearts of adamant,"
1665,THE SPY[33],And found them to submit--but princely favor
1666,THE SPY[33],Is like a fire that only burns as long
1667,THE SPY[33],As you afford it fuel. Before this conquest
1668,THE SPY[33],"Of Charlestown wears away, and hardly leaves"
1669,THE SPY[33],"A faint impression on the royal mind,"
1670,THE SPY[33],"Let's hatch some great exploit, some daring action"
1671,THE SPY[33],"That strikes into the heart of this rebellion,"
1672,THE SPY[33],"That one deed, treading on the heels of t'other,"
1673,THE SPY[33],May make us great indeed.
1674,THE SPY[33],
1675,THE SPY[33],_Maj. André._          I have been thinking
1676,THE SPY[33],"Some time, Sir Henry, what we should be doing."
1677,THE SPY[33],'Tis yet but early in the active season;
1678,THE SPY[33],"The summer scarce has finished her career,"
1679,THE SPY[33],"And in this mild, this pleasing temperate climate"
1680,THE SPY[33],Three months as yet are open for campaigns;
1681,THE SPY[33],"But then our worn-out, dying, wounded soldiers"
1682,THE SPY[33],Demand our pity. Those who came from Charlestown
1683,THE SPY[33],Have brought with them a lingering hectic fever
1684,THE SPY[33],Which hardly one survives. Our soldiers here
1685,THE SPY[33],"Who do the duty of the garrison,"
1686,THE SPY[33],"With constant watching, unremitted labor,"
1687,THE SPY[33],Cannot be spared from hence. Were we sufficient
1688,THE SPY[33],"In horse and foot to combat with the foe,"
1689,THE SPY[33],I forthwith would advise your Excellency
1690,THE SPY[33],"Once more to try the force of Washington,"
1691,THE SPY[33],"That so, by killing and by captivating"
1692,THE SPY[33],"Him and his troops, we totally might ruin"
1693,THE SPY[33],"This only stay, this bulwark of rebellion."
1694,THE SPY[33],But since our circumstances don't allow
1695,THE SPY[33],"With open force t' attack the hostile lines,"
1696,THE SPY[33],Let's try the witching power of bribery.
1697,THE SPY[33],We read the Prince of Macedon declared
1698,THE SPY[33],That those strong gates his javelins could not pierce
1699,THE SPY[33],"Nor battering ram effect a breach upon,"
1700,THE SPY[33],Were open still to gold.                             [_Pauses_
1701,THE SPY[33],
1702,THE SPY[33],"_Sir Henry._ Speak on, my friend,"
1703,THE SPY[33],For I approve the motion to my soul
1704,THE SPY[33],"If any project likely to succeed,"
1705,THE SPY[33],"Or well-planned scheme thou canst impart to me,"
1706,THE SPY[33],Gold shall not be deficient. Millions lie
1707,THE SPY[33],"Appropriated to this very purpose,"
1708,THE SPY[33],And often have I sent to sound some chiefs
1709,THE SPY[33],Whose qualities and influence are great
1710,THE SPY[33],"In yonder hostile camp, but their stern souls"
1711,THE SPY[33],Are so well armed with more than Spartan virtue
1712,THE SPY[33],"That there corruption seems to have no power,"
1713,THE SPY[33],And all my schemes and plans are come to nothing.
1714,THE SPY[33],
1715,THE SPY[33],_Maj. André._                     I know a man
1716,THE SPY[33],"Who, wouldst thou think it, by his chieftain trusted,"
1717,THE SPY[33],"And even this moment placed in high command,"
1718,THE SPY[33],And honoured to profusion by his country--
1719,THE SPY[33],The Americans in truth almost adore him--
1720,THE SPY[33],"That I do correspond with daily. O Britain, Britain,"
1721,THE SPY[33],That one descended from thy true-born sons
1722,THE SPY[33],"Should plot against the soil that gave him birth,"
1723,THE SPY[33],And for the value of a little gold
1724,THE SPY[33],Betray its dearest rights.
1725,THE SPY[33],But traitors are the growth of every country
1726,THE SPY[33],And Arnold is our own!
1727,THE SPY[33],
1728,THE SPY[33],_Sir Henry._ What say you? Arnold?
1729,THE SPY[33],Can Arnold then be bought? I greet you now!
1730,THE SPY[33],"Arnold, in chief command at West Point fort?"
1731,THE SPY[33],"Arnold, who galled our sides in Canada?"
1732,THE SPY[33],"Arnold, who took and plundered Montreal?"
1733,THE SPY[33],Gold shall not here be scarce if gold can buy him;
1734,THE SPY[33],"Ten thousand sterling pounds are at his service,"
1735,THE SPY[33],And twice ten thousand more if he deliver
1736,THE SPY[33],This West Point fort with its dependencies
1737,THE SPY[33],Into the hand of Clinton.
1738,THE SPY[33],
1739,THE SPY[33],"_Maj. André._ If we can gain the fort we all things gain,"
1740,THE SPY[33],The country round must at our mercy lie;
1741,THE SPY[33],"Then may our shipping sail to Albany,"
1742,THE SPY[33],"Disbark the troops that march for Saratoga,"
1743,THE SPY[33],"Who, taking thence the route to Lake Champlain,"
1744,THE SPY[33],"May soon reduce the forts, and in a month"
1745,THE SPY[33],"Open a new acquaintance with the north,"
1746,THE SPY[33],Communicated free to Canada.--
1747,THE SPY[33],Another great advantage we shall gain:
1748,THE SPY[33],"By being masters then of Hudson's river,"
1749,THE SPY[33],We shall cut off all intercourse and passage
1750,THE SPY[33],"Between the eastern and the southern states,"
1751,THE SPY[33],Which I conceive will be of consequence
1752,THE SPY[33],Toward the speedy ending of the war.
1753,THE SPY[33],
1754,THE SPY[33],_Sir Henry._ And so you say that we can buy the fort;
1755,THE SPY[33],Then happy I--my fame and fortune sure;
1756,THE SPY[33],This service will be of such eminence
1757,THE SPY[33],That Britain never can requite Sir Henry.
1758,THE SPY[33],
1759,THE SPY[33],"_Maj. André._ I do report that you can buy the fort,"
1760,THE SPY[33],For well I know the man I have to deal with;
1761,THE SPY[33],For just ten thousand guineas
1762,THE SPY[33],"The troops, the fort, and Arnold are your own."
1763,THE SPY[33],"And to this man, altho' he be a rascal,"
1764,THE SPY[33],You must consider we are obligated.
1765,THE SPY[33],"He quits his friends, his honour, and his country,"
1766,THE SPY[33],"The fame of all his great and brilliant actions,"
1767,THE SPY[33],"And the encomiums both of France and Spain,"
1768,THE SPY[33],"Perhaps all Europe, Britain not excepted,"
1769,THE SPY[33],Sold for ten thousand guineas and to serve us.
1770,THE SPY[33],
1771,THE SPY[33],_Sir Henry._ And obligated we confess ourselves.
1772,THE SPY[33],This West Point fort--for this a long campaign
1773,THE SPY[33],"I spent along the shores of Hudson's river,"
1774,THE SPY[33],"And failed at last with loss of Stony Point,"
1775,THE SPY[33],"The works, the stores, and twice three hundred soldiers,"
1776,THE SPY[33],"The prime of all my pack;--yes, powerful gold,"
1777,THE SPY[33],I own thy aid in this extremity.
1778,THE SPY[33],Tho' Britain be the greatest in the world
1779,THE SPY[33],"In ships and men with genius for the sea,"
1780,THE SPY[33],Yet cannot her stout navy take this fort
1781,THE SPY[33],By open force with all its weight of cannon.
1782,THE SPY[33],"It stands upon a craggy eminence,"
1783,THE SPY[33],"All fenced around with towers and battlements,"
1784,THE SPY[33],The works of mighty nature.
1785,THE SPY[33],To these subjoined the nicest aids of art--
1786,THE SPY[33],"Glacis and bastions, flanks and counter scarps,"
1787,THE SPY[33],"Horn works and moat, half moons and covert way,"
1788,THE SPY[33],"Trenches and mines, tenaille and battery,"
1789,THE SPY[33],"With guns of every size and every bore,"
1790,THE SPY[33],"And such a host of desperadoes there,"
1791,THE SPY[33],"Who to the last drop of their blood would hold it,"
1792,THE SPY[33],"That none but devils, I presume, can take it."
1793,THE SPY[33],"Beside, in sailing up the Hudson river,"
1794,THE SPY[33],"When from this fort you're yet a full mile distant,"
1795,THE SPY[33],You turn a point at whose extremity
1796,THE SPY[33],So high the mountains swell above the flood
1797,THE SPY[33],That in a moment all your sails are lifeless;
1798,THE SPY[33],"The southern breezes die that blew with vigor,"
1799,THE SPY[33],"And there you lie at mercy of the fort,"
1800,THE SPY[33],Your ships raked fore and aft and ruin around you.
1801,THE SPY[33],But all these difficulties cease if Arnold
1802,THE SPY[33],"Betray the place, as you would fain assure me."
1803,THE SPY[33],"Now tell me, friend, the manner, how and when"
1804,THE SPY[33],You did entice this champion from his duty.
1805,THE SPY[33],
1806,THE SPY[33],"_Maj. André._ From some connection I have had with him,"
1807,THE SPY[33],I found the leading feature of his soul
1808,THE SPY[33],"Was avarice. He could feign and counterfeit,"
1809,THE SPY[33],"Persuade you black was white or white was black,"
1810,THE SPY[33],"And swear, as interest prompted, false or true."
1811,THE SPY[33],"This known, I reasoned thus: If his base soul"
1812,THE SPY[33],"Can toil and fret and browbeat death itself,"
1813,THE SPY[33],Endure the summer suns and winter snows
1814,THE SPY[33],"In tedious route through hyperborean wilds,"
1815,THE SPY[33],"And sordid wealth alone incites him to it,"
1816,THE SPY[33],Why may not British gold have some effect
1817,THE SPY[33],On such a slavish soul? I wrote him straight
1818,THE SPY[33],"(Your pardon, sir, it was without your leave)"
1819,THE SPY[33],"And by a trusty lad I sent the letter,"
1820,THE SPY[33],"Sewed in a jacket, to the following import:"
1821,THE SPY[33],"That if he would forego his present station,"
1822,THE SPY[33],"Betray the fortress and the garrison,"
1823,THE SPY[33],"And he himself come over to our interest,"
1824,THE SPY[33],He should be recompensed in such a manner
1825,THE SPY[33],"That he might sit him down at ease in England,"
1826,THE SPY[33],Up to the eyes in wealth and laugh at rebels.
1827,THE SPY[33],
1828,THE SPY[33],"_Sir Henry._ And, pray, what answer did he send to this?"
1829,THE SPY[33],
1830,THE SPY[33],_Maj. André._ One that almost outdid my expectation.
1831,THE SPY[33],He wrote me back that if I would adventure
1832,THE SPY[33],"To trust myself within the Americ lines,"
1833,THE SPY[33],"He would, by means of secret friends and passports,"
1834,THE SPY[33],Gain me admittance to his residence;
1835,THE SPY[33],Or meeting close in personal interview
1836,THE SPY[33],"In some lone place hereafter to be fixed on,"
1837,THE SPY[33],Confer with me upon the fittest means
1838,THE SPY[33],Of rendering up his charge. He further added
1839,THE SPY[33],"That he was weary of this damned rebellion,"
1840,THE SPY[33],"For ten thousand guineas would be yours,"
1841,THE SPY[33],"That doing thus he meant his country's good,"
1842,THE SPY[33],And would pursue it to his utmost power.
1843,THE SPY[33],
1844,THE SPY[33],_Sir Henry._  Upon a lucky hour you thought of Arnold.
1845,THE SPY[33],"But, friend, I charge you, if this scheme succeed,"
1846,THE SPY[33],Take not the merit of it to yourself;
1847,THE SPY[33],But let the world imagine it was Clinton
1848,THE SPY[33],"Who schemed, who plotted, and seduced the villain;"
1849,THE SPY[33],That by this deed more honour I may gain
1850,THE SPY[33],Than if I had defeated Washington
1851,THE SPY[33],By dint of blows on yonder Jersey plain.
1852,THE SPY[33],"Your recompense shall not be wanting, André;"
1853,THE SPY[33],"My trusty friend, go make haste toward the highlands."
1854,THE SPY[33],A frigate shall be ready to convey you.
1855,THE SPY[33],"Accept the proffered conference, and bring"
1856,THE SPY[33],"Plans of the fort and all its avenues,"
1857,THE SPY[33],"The number of the soldiers that defend it,"
1858,THE SPY[33],And whate'er else may be of service to us;
1859,THE SPY[33],"That tho' if by chance his treason be discovered,"
1860,THE SPY[33],"And his designments lose their consummation,"
1861,THE SPY[33],We may have somewhat to facilitate--
1862,THE SPY[33],Some bold attack that may hereafter be
1863,THE SPY[33],Upon this proud and self-sufficient fortress.
1864,THE SPY[33],
1865,THE SPY[33],"_Maj. André._ But, sir, consider. If I undertake"
1866,THE SPY[33],"So bold a stroke as this, I risk my life,"
1867,THE SPY[33],Perhaps may meet an ignominious death.
1868,THE SPY[33],"When once I pass the British lines, that instant"
1869,THE SPY[33],Do I become a spy. That character
1870,THE SPY[33],"Ever belongs to common, vulgar men,"
1871,THE SPY[33],"To suttlers and to pedlars, desperate wretches,"
1872,THE SPY[33],The rubbish and the scourings of the world;
1873,THE SPY[33],Can I descend to so desperate an office?
1874,THE SPY[33],
1875,THE SPY[33],"_Sir Henry._ But, then, your country!--"
1876,THE SPY[33],Consider what it is you owe your country.
1877,THE SPY[33],"Distressed she combats with revolted nations,"
1878,THE SPY[33],And can't by force reduce them to subjection;
1879,THE SPY[33],"Assist her while you can, and take my word,"
1880,THE SPY[33],You need not fear an apprehension.
1881,THE SPY[33],"I charge you, be not found within their lines;"
1882,THE SPY[33],"Remember still to keep on neutral ground,"
1883,THE SPY[33],Unless a flag of truce be sent from Arnold
1884,THE SPY[33],That will secure your person and the plot.
1885,THE SPY[33],But if by chance you should be questioned
1886,THE SPY[33],"By any scouting parties of militia,"
1887,THE SPY[33],A purse of shillings scattered to the wretches
1888,THE SPY[33],Will soon procure a passage unmolested.
1889,THE SPY[33],"I long to hear the upshot of this meeting,"
1890,THE SPY[33],"The _Vulture_ man-of-war is at your service,"
1891,THE SPY[33],And shall to-morrow take you up the river
1892,THE SPY[33],As far as she with safety may adventure.
1893,THE SPY[33],
1894,THE SPY[33],_Maj. André._ Then for the sake of Britain and of you
1895,THE SPY[33],"Will I to Arnold haste away, Sir Harry."
1896,THE SPY[33],"If things succeed, as I expect they shall,"
1897,THE SPY[33],Within three days will I be back to tell you
1898,THE SPY[33],The means we fall upon to gain the fort.

1902,ACT II.,ACT II.
1903,ACT II.,
1904,ACT II.,
1905,ACT II.,SCENE I.--_Enter an aide-de-camp from_ GENERAL WASHINGTON _to_ ARNOLD.
1906,ACT II.,"_Scene, West Point Fort. Time, midnight._"
1907,ACT II.,
1908,ACT II.,"_Aide D. C._ Sir, I am sent by our renowned general"
1909,ACT II.,To let you know that in his best opinion
1910,ACT II.,Five hundred men in reason are too few
1911,ACT II.,To man the works of this important post.
1912,ACT II.,"Three thousand, he informs, are at your service,"
1913,ACT II.,"Lying at camp, with stores and baggage ready,"
1914,ACT II.,Whene'er you send a requisition for them.
1915,ACT II.,
1916,ACT II.,"_Arnold._ Five hundred are too few! Why, sir, what means he?"
1917,ACT II.,"I do assert, and do insist upon it,"
1918,ACT II.,That with the aid of scant two hundred men
1919,ACT II.,I could defend this fort and all its outworks
1920,ACT II.,(Its strength is so prodigious in defence)
1921,ACT II.,"Against ten legions of the boldest Britons,"
1922,ACT II.,"With Clinton at the head to lead them on,"
1923,ACT II.,Whether he choose to come by sea or land.
1924,ACT II.,
1925,ACT II.,_Aide D. C._ Well be it so. I have discharged my duty
1926,ACT II.,In bringing you our noble general's message.
1927,ACT II.,"Pray, sir, have you commands to send from hence?"
1928,ACT II.,My time to stay is short; I must be going.
1929,ACT II.,
1930,ACT II.,"_Arnold._ Tho' I am steady to my sentiment,"
1931,ACT II.,"That these five hundred men are full sufficient,"
1932,ACT II.,"Yet, to comply with the spirit of his meaning,"
1933,ACT II.,"You may inform the general, two hours' warning"
1934,ACT II.,Will bring me in four thousand of militia.
1935,ACT II.,"They are as rugged and as hardy fellows,"
1936,ACT II.,"As bold and desperate in the works of war,"
1937,ACT II.,"As skilled to hit the mark or push the bagnet,"
1938,ACT II.,As any of the choicest continentals.
1939,ACT II.,"Pray tell the general this, and I am sure,"
1940,ACT II.,"I'm satisfied, he'll be of my opinion.      [_Exit Aide D. C._"
1941,ACT II.,
1942,ACT II.,_Arnold_ (_solus_). This is the time for dark and dangerous action;
1943,ACT II.,This is the time that thieves and murderers choose
1944,ACT II.,To execute their desperate designs.
1945,ACT II.,"But art thou, Arnold, less than murderer,"
1946,ACT II.,Who thus prepare to stab thy bleeding country?
1947,ACT II.,And can I then descend to be a traitor!
1948,ACT II.,"By honest toils a name have I acquired,"
1949,ACT II.,Great and unequalled in the rolls of fame;
1950,ACT II.,And shall that name to infamy be doomed
1951,ACT II.,By one base act that mars and cankers all?
1952,ACT II.,For this have I in winter's joyless reign
1953,ACT II.,"Explored the naked wilds of northern clime,"
1954,ACT II.,When mid the snows and frosts and chilling winds
1955,ACT II.,"Cold earth has been my bed. Ambition, rise"
1956,ACT II.,And fire my soul to nobler purposes.
1957,ACT II.,"To-morrow Major André comes to meet me,"
1958,ACT II.,And I am to consult on ways and means
1959,ACT II.,To give this fort up to my country's foes.
1960,ACT II.,"Shall I repent of my unjust proceedings,"
1961,ACT II.,"Admit this daring Briton to my portal,"
1962,ACT II.,And say I did thus to entrap the man
1963,ACT II.,Who is grand vizar to Sir Henry Clinton?
1964,ACT II.,Whose scheming head doth hurt our country more
1965,ACT II.,Than all their host beside?
1966,ACT II.,"But that would be ungenerous--more than that,"
1967,ACT II.,Ten thousand guineas are the offered price
1968,ACT II.,"Of my desertion--more than that, perhaps"
1969,ACT II.,I shall henceforward be caressed by kings
1970,ACT II.,And bear a generalship that may reduce
1971,ACT II.,These states revolted back to Britain's sway.
1972,ACT II.,*    *    *    *    *  For now I do imagine
1973,ACT II.,"They have no rights, no claims to independence."
1974,ACT II.,"Born were we all, subjected to a king,"
1975,ACT II.,And that subjection must return again.
1976,ACT II.,"The people are not dull republicans,"
1977,ACT II.,By nature they incline to monarchy.
1978,ACT II.,How glorious should I be to have a share
1979,ACT II.,In bringing back my country to allegiance.
1980,ACT II.,"Can France uphold them in their proud demand,"
1981,ACT II.,"That race of puny, base, perfidious dogs?"
1982,ACT II.,Sooner shall all the house of Bourbon sink
1983,ACT II.,"Their Rochambault, D'Estang and La Fayette,"
1984,ACT II.,"And Spain confederate cease to be a nation,"
1985,ACT II.,"And all their allies dwindle into atoms,"
1986,ACT II.,Ere Britain will withdraw her righteous claim
1987,ACT II.,Or yield a jot of her dominion here
1988,ACT II.,"To any people living. Then, André, come,"

1992,ACT II.,"SCENE II.--MAJOR ANDRÉ, LUCINDA. _Parlor._"
1993,ACT II.,
1994,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ I cannot leave this city, sweet Lucinda, without imparting"
1995,ACT II.,"to you that I am going a little way toward the American lines, at the"
1996,ACT II.,"request of his Excellency, upon some business of importance. I am come"
1997,ACT II.,to chat a little with you ere I go. It may be some days before you see
1998,ACT II.,me again.
1999,ACT II.,
2000,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ If it be not too great a presumption in me, my dear Major, I"
2001,ACT II.,would beg to know whether you depart on a peaceable or hostile errand.
2002,ACT II.,You must pardon a woman's curiosity. I had a frightful dream about you a
2003,ACT II.,"few nights ago, which I cannot banish from my mind ever since."
2004,ACT II.,
2005,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ I am happy, madam, in being the subject of your dreams."
2006,ACT II.,"But dreams are delusions of the mind, mere vagaries and whimsies not to"
2007,ACT II.,"be attended to. You may remember that, prior to our Charlestown"
2008,ACT II.,"expedition, you discouraged me a good deal with a vision you had of a"
2009,ACT II.,"vessel shipwrecked, and myself with the other passengers drowned, and"
2010,ACT II.,"yet little or nothing was intimated thereby. We made our passage safe,"
2011,ACT II.,"conquered the place, and returned with victory and honor."
2012,ACT II.,
2013,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ True. But your fleet endured a terrible hurricane, in which"
2014,ACT II.,many perished.
2015,ACT II.,
2016,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ O Lucinda, thou art a dreamer of dreams, thou thinkest,"
2017,ACT II.,love.
2018,ACT II.,
2019,ACT II.,_Lucinda._ This last was represented to my mind in quite a different
2020,ACT II.,"manner, in such lively colours that I cannot help thinking some evil is"
2021,ACT II.,foreboded to you.
2022,ACT II.,
2023,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ Poh! Let's hear the extraordinary dream, then, that we may"
2024,ACT II.,laugh a little at it.
2025,ACT II.,
2026,ACT II.,_Lucinda._ I imagined myself in a country where the skies were forever
2027,ACT II.,"cloudy and gloomy, with frequent bursts of thunder and flashes of"
2028,ACT II.,"lightning. Among many other objects, all of which seemed disconsolate"
2029,ACT II.,"and melancholy, I saw you endeavouring to reach the summit of a sharp,"
2030,ACT II.,craggy precipice. You leaped with surprising agility over dark gulfs and
2031,ACT II.,"apertures therein, which no other man would have thought of passing. The"
2032,ACT II.,spectators admired your activity and daring spirit. The continual
2033,ACT II.,"obstacles in your way seemed nothing to you, and at length you bid fair"
2034,ACT II.,"to gain the summit, when, catching hold of a shrub, which was but"
2035,ACT II.,"slightly rooted in one of the crevices of the rock, it instantly gave"
2036,ACT II.,"way, and you tumbled to the bottom, dashed to pieces on the pointed"
2037,ACT II.,crags and torn in a shocking manner. I shrieked out and waked.
2038,ACT II.,
2039,ACT II.,_Maj. André._ Your dream was frightful indeed; but still it was nothing
2040,ACT II.,"but a dream. Why, I have imagined before now in my sleep that I have"
2041,ACT II.,tumbled down ten thousand fathoms in a perpendicular line; but all this
2042,ACT II.,"was owing to mere mechanical causes, the motion of the animal spirits or"
2043,ACT II.,the veins being rather too replete with blood.
2044,ACT II.,
2045,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ Well, be it so. I hope my dream may be the forerunner of no"
2046,ACT II.,"mischief. But are you going out on a fighting expedition, sir, if I may"
2047,ACT II.,be so bold to ask the question?
2048,ACT II.,
2049,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ My dearest love, I will conceal nothing from you. I know"
2050,ACT II.,you are the girl of a thousand for keeping a secret. It must not take
2051,ACT II.,air. I have corrupted General Arnold. He is to sell West Point fort to
2052,ACT II.,"me, and this evening I am to set out and consult with him upon the"
2053,ACT II.,fittest means to blind the eyes of the Samson and deliver up the place
2054,ACT II.,to Sir Henry without danger of failure.
2055,ACT II.,
2056,ACT II.,_Lucinda._ But could not some person be deputized for this purpose whose
2057,ACT II.,life is not of such value to Britain as yours? You are a proud soul to
2058,ACT II.,Sir Henry Clinton. He enterprises nothing without first having your
2059,ACT II.,advice and direction. If you should be intercepted in your way by the
2060,ACT II.,"Americans, would it not endanger your life, my dear André, to be found"
2061,ACT II.,without some mission or any plausible excuse for being within an enemy's
2062,ACT II.,lines?
2063,ACT II.,
2064,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ You are too timorous, Lucinda. I shall go and come by"
2065,ACT II.,water in an armed ship. I may perhaps just venture on shore in a
2066,ACT II.,"----[34] of time, but shall take care not to expose myself to any"
2067,ACT II.,"danger. I well know how far to venture, but if the worst come to the"
2068,ACT II.,"worst, I can tell them I have deserted from the British. Then I shall be"
2069,ACT II.,caressed among them till such times as I can find an opportunity to
2070,ACT II.,escape and join my countrymen.
2071,ACT II.,
2072,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ You venture all this, you say, at the request of Sir Henry?"
2073,ACT II.,
2074,ACT II.,_Maj. André._ Yes; but chiefly to serve my country. Had I a thousand
2075,ACT II.,"lives, I would lay them all down for Britain and my king. But I must go."
2076,ACT II.,"You deject my spirits, my girl. A woman is destructive to the spirit of"
2077,ACT II.,enterprise in a man. Poh! I am growing melancholy too. You must cheer my
2078,ACT II.,"drooping soul, Lucinda. I heard you humming a little song the other day."
2079,ACT II.,"Do let's have it. I think it begins thus: ""My native shades delight no"
2080,ACT II.,"more."""
2081,ACT II.,
2082,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ Although I am in no humour for music, you shall hear it, my"
2083,ACT II.,love. I suppose it was made by some British officer on his setting out
2084,ACT II.,"for America, who was as great an idolater to his king and country as"
2085,ACT II.,most English gentlemen.
2086,ACT II.,
2087,ACT II.,[_Sings_
2088,ACT II.,"My native shades delight no more,[35]"
2089,ACT II.,"I haste to meet the ocean's roar,"
2090,ACT II.,I seek a wild inclement shore
2091,ACT II.,Beyond the Atlantic main:
2092,ACT II.,'Tis virtue calls!--I must away!--
2093,ACT II.,"Nor care nor pleasure tempts my stay,"
2094,ACT II.,"Nor all that love himself can say,"
2095,ACT II.,A moment shall detain.
2096,ACT II.,
2097,ACT II.,To meet those hosts who dare disown
2098,ACT II.,"Allegiance to Britannia's throne,"
2099,ACT II.,"I draw the sword that pities none,"
2100,ACT II.,I draw their rebel blood;
2101,ACT II.,"Amazement shall their troops confound,"
2102,ACT II.,When hackt and prostrate on the ground;
2103,ACT II.,My blade shall drink from every wound
2104,ACT II.,A life-restoring flood!
2105,ACT II.,
2106,ACT II.,"The swarthy Indian, yet unbroke,"
2107,ACT II.,"Shall bind his neck to Britain's yoke,"
2108,ACT II.,Or flee from her avenging stroke
2109,ACT II.,To deserts all unknown;
2110,ACT II.,"The southern isles shall own her sway,"
2111,ACT II.,"Peru and Mexico obey,"
2112,ACT II.,And those who yet to Satan pray
2113,ACT II.,Beyond the southern zone.
2114,ACT II.,
2115,ACT II.,"For George the Third I dare to fall,"
2116,ACT II.,Since he to me is all in all;
2117,ACT II.,May he subdue this earthly ball
2118,ACT II.,And nations tribute bring.
2119,ACT II.,"Yon western states shall wear his chain,"
2120,ACT II.,"Where traitors now with tyrants reign,"
2121,ACT II.,And subject shall be all the main
2122,ACT II.,"To George, our potent king."
2123,ACT II.,
2124,ACT II.,"When honour calls to guard his throne,"
2125,ACT II.,My life I dare not call my own;
2126,ACT II.,My life I yield without a groan
2127,ACT II.,For him whom I adore.
2128,ACT II.,"In lasting glory shall he reign,"
2129,ACT II.,"'Tis he shall conquer France and Spain,"
2130,ACT II.,Tho' I perhaps may ne'er again
2131,ACT II.,Behold my native shore.
2132,ACT II.,
2133,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ You sing charmingly, Lucinda. The poor fellow's resolution"
2134,ACT II.,"pleases me. He engages to give his life, if necessary, for his king and"
2135,ACT II.,"country, and yet perhaps he feels the ingratitude of both every hour in"
2136,ACT II.,"the day. It must, however, be so. Nature has formed us with a principle"
2137,ACT II.,"of love to our native land. What say you, Lucinda?"
2138,ACT II.,
2139,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ It may be so, sir; and yet that love need not carry us to"
2140,ACT II.,such an idolatrous extravagance as is manifested in the little stanzas I
2141,ACT II.,had the pleasure of singing to you.
2142,ACT II.,
2143,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ Indeed you are in the right, but we are slaves to custom."
2144,ACT II.,
2145,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ I have sung to please you, my love; now, if you have leisure,"
2146,ACT II.,I would beg your attention a moment to a little ditty that pleases
2147,ACT II.,myself.
2148,ACT II.,
2149,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ Most gladly, my angel; I can prolong half an hour yet in"
2150,ACT II.,your agreeable company.
2151,ACT II.,
2152,ACT II.,[_Looking at his watch_
2153,ACT II.,
2154,ACT II.,_Lucinda sings_[36]
2155,ACT II.,
2156,ACT II.,You chide me and tell me I must not complain
2157,ACT II.,To part a few days from my favourite swain.
2158,ACT II.,"He is gone to the battle and leaves me to mourn,"
2159,ACT II.,"And say what you please, he will never return."
2160,ACT II.,
2161,ACT II.,"When he left me he kissed me, and said, my sweet dear,"
2162,ACT II.,In less than a month I again will be here;
2163,ACT II.,"With anguish and sorrow my bosom did burn,"
2164,ACT II.,"And I wept, being sure he would never return."
2165,ACT II.,
2166,ACT II.,"I said, my dear creature, I beg you would stay,"
2167,ACT II.,But he with his soldiers went strutting away.
2168,ACT II.,"Then why should I longer my sorrows adjourn,"
2169,ACT II.,For I know in my heart he will never return.
2170,ACT II.,
2171,ACT II.,"Whenever there's danger he loves to be there,"
2172,ACT II.,He fights like a hero when others despair.
2173,ACT II.,In this expedition he goes to his urn;
2174,ACT II.,You call me a fool if he ever return.
2175,ACT II.,
2176,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ The application of this I must take to myself, I suppose."
2177,ACT II.,"Fie upon you, lady; you need to divert me with merry jokes and a strain"
2178,ACT II.,"of wit peculiar to yourself. You now are pensive, demure, and"
2179,ACT II.,"melancholy. You make me so, too."
2180,ACT II.,
2181,ACT II.,_Lucinda._ Yonder comes Sir Henry. I suppose he has some private
2182,ACT II.,business with you. I must retire.
2183,ACT II.,
2184,ACT II.,[_Exit Lucinda. Enter Sir Henry and others_
2185,ACT II.,
2186,ACT II.,_Maj. André._ How do your Excellencies? Will you please to sit?
2187,ACT II.,
2188,ACT II.,_Sir Henry._
2189,ACT II.,
2190,ACT II.,Till you return from this important errand
2191,ACT II.,"I am a slave to impatience, Major André."
2192,ACT II.,"I beg you would this night equip with speed,"
2193,ACT II.,And on an eagle's wings to Arnold haste.
2194,ACT II.,"The frigate lies at single anchor ready,"
2195,ACT II.,And winds propitious to our purpose blow.
2196,ACT II.,"But hark ye, friend, and tell the general then"
2197,ACT II.,"That if he can by any means at all,"
2198,ACT II.,"On any artful, plausible pretence,"
2199,ACT II.,So manage matters and with such address
2200,ACT II.,"As to entice the great Americ chief,"
2201,ACT II.,"At that same hour the fort is yielded to us,"
2202,ACT II.,"There to be present on some feigned business,"
2203,ACT II.,"That so we may be master of his person,"
2204,ACT II.,Tell him if he does this his pay is double.
2205,ACT II.,"Besides ten thousand guineas we have promised,"
2206,ACT II.,"Ten thousand more with gratitude I'll pay,"
2207,ACT II.,"And think him cheaply bought. He is the soul,"
2208,ACT II.,The great upholder of this long contention.
2209,ACT II.,I dread his prudence and his courage more
2210,ACT II.,"Than all the armies that the Congress raise,"
2211,ACT II.,Than all the troops or all the ships of France.
2212,ACT II.,
2213,ACT II.,_Maj. André._
2214,ACT II.,
2215,ACT II.,Well thought!  I shall obey your Excellency.
2216,ACT II.,"It is a bold and dangerous undertaking,"
2217,ACT II.,"'Tis hazardous, but not impossible."
2218,ACT II.,To win on this great chief--'tis a bright thought.
2219,ACT II.,He'll think himself as safe at West Point Fort
2220,ACT II.,"As in the bosom of his spacious camp,"
2221,ACT II.,And therefore will not hesitate to come
2222,ACT II.,Only attended by a score of guards.
2223,ACT II.,The same attempt may seize the fort and him.
2224,ACT II.,
2225,ACT II.,_Sir Henry._
2226,ACT II.,
2227,ACT II.,"And be precise to fix the time, when we"
2228,ACT II.,Must take possession of the citadel.
2229,ACT II.,Against the hour that I expect you back
2230,ACT II.,Five thousand troops shall be embarked and ready
2231,ACT II.,To execute whatever plan you fix on.
2232,ACT II.,
2233,ACT II.,[_Exit Sir Henry. Reënter Lucinda with a handkerchief to her eyes_
2234,ACT II.,
2235,ACT II.,_Maj. André._ The time is come that is appointed for my departure. It is
2236,ACT II.,impossible that even beauty or wit or tears can now withhold me from my
2237,ACT II.,purpose. I have promised his Excellency and now to hesitate would prove
2238,ACT II.,"me to be a coward, one altogether unworthy to be trusted with any"
2239,ACT II.,business that requires wit and dexterity.
2240,ACT II.,
2241,ACT II.,"_Lucinda._ Your resolution is fixed, and I do not desire you to fall"
2242,ACT II.,from it; only if heaven should so order that any fatal accident befall
2243,ACT II.,"you, remember the unfortunate Lucinda. She sends her good wishes along"
2244,ACT II.,"with you, and prays for all imaginable prosperity on every undertaking"
2245,ACT II.,in which Major André bears a part.
2246,ACT II.,
2247,ACT II.,"_Maj. André._ My thanks to you, my dearest. If a heart so good as thine"
2248,ACT II.,"petition heaven for my safety, I have nothing to fear. Thy prayers are"
2249,ACT II.,"my guardian angels, and will protect me in every danger. My honour calls"
2250,ACT II.,"me and I must go. Give me a parting kiss, my dear. Adieu, adieu."
2251,ACT II.,
2252,ACT II.,[_He leaves her_
2253,ACT II.,"Now native courage warm my wavering breast,"
2254,ACT II.,"And fires of resolution blaze within me,"
2255,ACT II.,"For I must on a dangerous errand go,"
2256,ACT II.,"With secret cunning to deceive the foe,"
2257,ACT II.,"Whose active souls in dire connections meet,"
2258,ACT II.,Where one false step my ruin makes complete.
2259,ACT II.,"Ye guardian powers that still protect the brave,"
2260,ACT II.,Some pity on distressed Britain have.
2261,ACT II.,By me she seeks some portion to regain
2262,ACT II.,"Of her lost empire, tried so oft in vain."
2263,ACT II.,"But dreadful scenes before my eyes appear,"
2264,ACT II.,And dangers thicken as they draw more near.
2265,ACT II.,"But soft--no dangers can my heart appal,"
2266,ACT II.,I have a soul that can despise them all.
2267,ACT II.,"More than an equal chance for life I see,"
2268,ACT II.,But life and death must be the same to me.             [_Exit_

2276,ACT III.,
2277,ACT III.,_Arnold._ How looks the weather?
2278,ACT III.,
2279,ACT III.,"_Pasquin._ Stormy, sir; very stormy; it blows terrifically and there is"
2280,ACT III.,heavy rain.
2281,ACT III.,
2282,ACT III.,_Arnold._ Pasquin!
2283,ACT III.,
2284,ACT III.,_Pasquin._ Sir.
2285,ACT III.,
2286,ACT III.,_Arnold._ Tell the sentries upon duty to-night that I expect a gentleman
2287,ACT III.,of my acquaintance here about ten o'clock. When he comes to the outer
2288,ACT III.,"gate, bid one of them conduct him to my apartment."
2289,ACT III.,
2290,ACT III.,_Pasquin._ Your honour shall be obeyed. [_Exit_
2291,ACT III.,
2292,ACT III.,_Arnold_ (_solus_).
2293,ACT III.,
2294,ACT III.,Peace to this gloomy grove that sees me acting
2295,ACT III.,What open daylight would disdain to own.
2296,ACT III.,"Ye wood, be witness of my dark designs,"
2297,ACT III.,"And shade me o'er, ye lofty eminences;"
2298,ACT III.,"Tremendous gloom, encompass me around"
2299,ACT III.,"In clouds that wing from Greenland's foggy caves,"
2300,ACT III.,"Plutonian darkness on your pinions bring,"
2301,ACT III.,"Conceal my base intent from human view,"
2302,ACT III.,And be the daylight still a stranger to it.
2303,ACT III.,"Storm on, ye wind, the tempest that ye make"
2304,ACT III.,In the broad regions of the troubled ether
2305,ACT III.,Is quiet to the tumult of my soul!
2306,ACT III.,"Departing honour,--take thy last adieu,"
2307,ACT III.,'Tis this night's deed that stamps me for a villain.
2308,ACT III.,Who comes there?                              [_Enter Pasquin_
2309,ACT III.,
2310,ACT III.,"_Pasquin._ Sir, there is a traveller just alighted at Sergeant Jones's"
2311,ACT III.,"quarters, who desires to know whether he can have a little private"
2312,ACT III.,"conference with you, and asked me whether you were alone or no."
2313,ACT III.,
2314,ACT III.,_Arnold._ A traveller? How is he dressed?
2315,ACT III.,
2316,ACT III.,"_Pasquin._ He has on a plain suit of blue clothes, a cocked beaver hat"
2317,ACT III.,"and draw boots. He rides a common bay horse, and by his general"
2318,ACT III.,"appearance one would suppose him to be a commissary, or perhaps a"
2319,ACT III.,quarter-master.
2320,ACT III.,
2321,ACT III.,_Arnold._ How came you to know all these particulars; the night being so
2322,ACT III.,dark and stormy?
2323,ACT III.,
2324,ACT III.,_Pasquin._ I had a glimpse of him by means of a lanthorn we carried out
2325,ACT III.,"when he got off his horse. Over all, I forgot to mention, he had a"
2326,ACT III.,fear-naught riding coat.
2327,ACT III.,
2328,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ A plain blue suit, you say?"
2329,ACT III.,
2330,ACT III.,_Pasquin._ Yes.
2331,ACT III.,
2332,ACT III.,_Arnold._ And draw boots?
2333,ACT III.,
2334,ACT III.,_Pasquin._ Yes.
2335,ACT III.,
2336,ACT III.,_Arnold._ And wore he sword?
2337,ACT III.,
2338,ACT III.,"_Pasquin._ No; he had no sword, that I saw."
2339,ACT III.,
2340,ACT III.,_Arnold._ And what aspect is he? Is he a well-looking man?
2341,ACT III.,
2342,ACT III.,"_Pasquin._ As handsome a man, please your honour, as ever the sun shone"
2343,ACT III.,upon. It did me good to look upon him.
2344,ACT III.,
2345,ACT III.,_Arnold_ (_aside_). This must be him.
2346,ACT III.,
2347,ACT III.,"[_To Pasquin_] Bid the sergeant show him the way to me immediately, and"
2348,ACT III.,"put up his horse in my own stable. He is from Philadelphia, a friend and"
2349,ACT III.,relative of mine.
2350,ACT III.,
2351,ACT III.,[_Exit Pasquin_
2352,ACT III.,
2353,ACT III.,"_Arnold_ (_solus_). This is Major André, indeed. We have agreed in our"
2354,ACT III.,"correspondence that he shall pass here under the name of Captain Ashton,"
2355,ACT III.,to prevent suspicion.
2356,ACT III.,
2357,ACT III.,[_Sergeant introduces Major André_
2358,ACT III.,
2359,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ Captain Ashton, my friend, how are you? Please to draw near"
2360,ACT III.,the fire and sit. How do our friends at Philadelphia? [_Exit sergeant_]
2361,ACT III.,"The booby is now gone, and we may talk freely without suspicion."
2362,ACT III.,
2363,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ I am happy at length to see General Arnold, with whom I"
2364,ACT III.,"have corresponded so long at a distance. I hope, my dear general, you"
2365,ACT III.,are ready to perform your promise.
2366,ACT III.,
2367,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ Undoubtedly the fort shall be yours within three days, upon"
2368,ACT III.,the conditions I mentioned to you in my last letter. I hope you have
2369,ACT III.,apprised Sir Henry of them.
2370,ACT III.,
2371,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ Yes, sir. He is satisfied, and thinks your demand really"
2372,ACT III.,moderate; but now let us to the point. We must fall upon some plan by
2373,ACT III.,which we must act without much danger of miscarriage. Would it not be
2374,ACT III.,"best that our troops should seem to take the fort by surprise, and thus"
2375,ACT III.,prevent the world from having any suspicion of treachery in the case?
2376,ACT III.,
2377,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ I have had the same thought, my dear sir. Besides, if we can"
2378,ACT III.,"make this pass, I shall become a prisoner of war to you in appearance,"
2379,ACT III.,"be exchanged after a little time, and so be in a capacity to serve you"
2380,ACT III.,"again; or, pretending the fort not tenable, I may make my escape during"
2381,ACT III.,"your attack, and all this without any suspicion on the part of the"
2382,ACT III.,Americans.
2383,ACT III.,
2384,ACT III.,_Maj. André._ God grant your scheme may be successful.
2385,ACT III.,
2386,ACT III.,_Arnold._ Now hear what I have to propose further. When you are embarked
2387,ACT III.,"with your army, suppose one or two thousand men or more sail up the"
2388,ACT III.,"river as far as you safely can, short of the fort, and endeavour to make"
2389,ACT III.,the country believe you are on a plundering expedition. I shall have
2390,ACT III.,companies out who will give me notice of all your movements. Then land
2391,ACT III.,"your men, march up to the fort, demand a surrender, which I will"
2392,ACT III.,absolutely refuse. Upon which hang out your bloody flag and fire against
2393,ACT III.,"the walls point blank, without mercy. In that part of the fortress where"
2394,ACT III.,"I shall be, you will see a small white flag flying. Do not fire to that"
2395,ACT III.,quarter. The garrison shall discharge the artillery three times over
2396,ACT III.,"your heads, after which I will surrender and open the gates to you."
2397,ACT III.,"Then, by not putting one of the garrison to death, which would be your"
2398,ACT III.,"right, you having stormed it, you will have an excellent opportunity of"
2399,ACT III.,giving the world a new instance of British humanity. Then you may pour
2400,ACT III.,"your troops into the fort, take possession of it, and hoist the British"
2401,ACT III.,flag. The prisoners may immediately be sent to the shipping and ordered
2402,ACT III.,to New York before the Continental forces will have a chance of
2403,ACT III.,hindering the embarkation. What say you?
2404,ACT III.,
2405,ACT III.,_Maj. André._ Excellently well imagined. I hope it may succeed. The
2406,ACT III.,money shall be paid you on your arrival at York; but there is another
2407,ACT III.,"service Sir Henry would fain hope you could indulge him in, and your"
2408,ACT III.,reward shall be double.
2409,ACT III.,
2410,ACT III.,_Arnold._ What may it be?
2411,ACT III.,
2412,ACT III.,_Maj. André._ He is eager to be possessed of your Commander-in-Chief.
2413,ACT III.,Could you contrive no way to get him into our hands? He is the soul of
2414,ACT III.,"this obstinate rebellion. Were he a prisoner to us, America would soon"
2415,ACT III.,be ours again.
2416,ACT III.,
2417,ACT III.,"_Arnold_ (_pausing_). Why, true, it would greatly facilitate the"
2418,ACT III.,recovery of the colonies. Let me see. I will endeavour to prevail upon
2419,ACT III.,"him to spend a day or two at Robinson's home. Nay, I am sure he will be"
2420,ACT III.,"here next Monday, and the garrison. There are a number of disaffected"
2421,ACT III.,"people not far from hence, whom I can engage to secure his person and"
2422,ACT III.,convey him on board the _Vulture_ ship of war.
2423,ACT III.,
2424,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ If we become by your means possessed of these two jewels,"
2425,ACT III.,"General Washington and this important fort, we shall never think the"
2426,ACT III.,obligation sufficiently acknowledged. You will become the greatest man
2427,ACT III.,in the world. Britain will adore you. She will kiss the very ground you
2428,ACT III.,"tread upon, besides lavishing wealth upon you by millions."
2429,ACT III.,
2430,ACT III.,_Arnold._ She is heartily welcome to such poor services as I can render
2431,ACT III.,"her. What I do is from principle, from the consciousness of a rectitude"
2432,ACT III.,of heart and love to my country.
2433,ACT III.,
2434,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ Sir, you were born to be a great man. Now, if you will be"
2435,ACT III.,"pleased to deliver me the plan of the fort, signals of recognizance and"
2436,ACT III.,"other papers of consequence in this affair, I will be going. I do not"
2437,ACT III.,think myself safe till such times as I get within the British lines
2438,ACT III.,again.
2439,ACT III.,
2440,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ The danger is trifling. With a passport from me, you may go"
2441,ACT III.,anywhere in these colonies.
2442,ACT III.,
2443,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ Sir, I thank you. It may be of service indeed."
2444,ACT III.,
2445,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ I will write it immediately. There, sir; and here is the"
2446,ACT III.,"packet. I will not detain you, because I know the business requires"
2447,ACT III.,"dispatch. You will, however, sup with me, and take a glass of wine"
2448,ACT III.,before you go.
2449,ACT III.,
2450,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ I shall hardly have time; however, I will wait half an"
2451,ACT III.,hour.
2452,ACT III.,
2453,ACT III.,_Arnold._ Walk with me into this other apartment; we soldiers do not
2454,ACT III.,stand upon ceremony. But how do you carry these papers so as to conceal
2455,ACT III.,them in case you meet with any over-curious persons?
2456,ACT III.,
2457,ACT III.,_Maj. André._ I have an expedient. I can carry them in the foot of my
2458,ACT III.,boot. Do you see how snug they lie?
2459,ACT III.,
2460,ACT III.,[_Putting them on_
2461,ACT III.,
2462,ACT III.,"_Arnold._ Aye, faith, that was well thought of; but do not put the"
2463,ACT III.,passport in your boot.
2464,ACT III.,
2465,ACT III.,"_Maj. André._ No, no. That goes into my pocket."

2472,ACT III.,"Whence come ye, brothers, at so late an hour?"
2473,ACT III.,
2474,ACT III.,"_Vin._ From scouring all the country up and down,"
2475,ACT III.,"To seize, if fortune please, illicit traders,"
2476,ACT III.,Who are so bold and unscrupulous grown
2477,ACT III.,"That oft in open day, as well as night,"
2478,ACT III.,They bear large cargoes of provision down
2479,ACT III.,To yonder ships that still infest our river.
2480,ACT III.,"How I detest these underhanded scoundrels,"
2481,ACT III.,"Who, hungry as the grave for British gold,"
2482,ACT III.,Feed the vile foe that lurks within our harbours.
2483,ACT III.,
2484,ACT III.,"_Am._ Gods! Can they be so base,--but there are they"
2485,ACT III.,"Who sell their country for a mess of pottage,--"
2486,ACT III.,"A servile, scheming race whose god is gain,"
2487,ACT III.,Who for a little gold would stab their fathers
2488,ACT III.,And plunder life from her who gave them life.
2489,ACT III.,These are not true Americans. They are
2490,ACT III.,"A spurious race--scum, dregs, and bastards all."
2491,ACT III.,"They are not true Americans, I say."
2492,ACT III.,
2493,ACT III.,"_As._ They cannot be, they help toward our ruin."
2494,ACT III.,"But, gentlemen, I'll tell you what I think;"
2495,ACT III.,"We have so many lurking foes within,"
2496,ACT III.,"And such a potent enemy without,"
2497,ACT III.,"That I almost despair, I must confess,"
2498,ACT III.,That ever we shall rend these thirteen States
2499,ACT III.,"From persevering Britain, and compel"
2500,ACT III.,Acknowledgment of independence here.
2501,ACT III.,
2502,ACT III.,_Vin._ Say not so.
2503,ACT III.,"The rights of humanity, 'tis these we fight for,"
2504,ACT III.,And not to carry ruin round the globe.
2505,ACT III.,Appearances are so much in our favour
2506,ACT III.,"That he who doubts that this event shall be,"
2507,ACT III.,Must be as blind as he whose useless orbs
2508,ACT III.,Have never drank the radiated light.

2520,ACT III.,"But, friends, why stay we here? By yonder stars"
2521,ACT III.,"That still revolving point toward the pole,"
2522,ACT III.,I find it must be midnight.
2523,ACT III.,
2524,ACT III.,"_Vin._ I do expect a score of peasants here,"
2525,ACT III.,"A set of hardy, bold, and faithful fellows,"
2526,ACT III.,Whom I can trust in all emergencies.
2527,ACT III.,In different parties I shall these despatch
2528,ACT III.,"Toward the hostile lines, for I suspect"
2529,ACT III.,That intercourse too often doth subsist
2530,ACT III.,Between our disaffected and the foe.
2531,ACT III.,
2532,ACT III.,_Amb._ And are these peasants armed?
2533,ACT III.,
2534,ACT III.,_Vin._ Armed with a musquet and a bayonet;
2535,ACT III.,A true and desperate soldier wants no more.
2536,ACT III.,
2537,ACT III.,"_As._ And thirty cartridges to every man,"
2538,ACT III.,With three days' victuals in their knapsacks stored.
2539,ACT III.,
2540,ACT III.,_Amb._ It is enough. I hope they will not tarry.

2544,ACT III.,
2545,ACT III.,"_1st P._ Do you know what we are sent for, brother Harry?"
2546,ACT III.,
2547,ACT III.,"_2nd P._ To go on some secret expedition, I suppose."
2548,ACT III.,
2549,ACT III.,"_1st P._ And which way shall we bend, think ye?"
2550,ACT III.,
2551,ACT III.,_2nd P._ God bless you. Why do you ask such a question? It is not for us
2552,ACT III.,"to know where we are going. We shall know bye and bye, I warrant you,"
2553,ACT III.,after we have marched two or three score of miles.
2554,ACT III.,
2555,ACT III.,_1st P._ And where are our officers?
2556,ACT III.,
2557,ACT III.,_2nd P._ They are in the adjoining house. They will be with us
2558,ACT III.,presently.
2559,ACT III.,
2560,ACT III.,_3rd P._ And how shall we pass the time till they come?
2561,ACT III.,
2562,ACT III.,"_2nd P._ O, merrily enough. We can dance and sing."
2563,ACT III.,
2564,ACT III.,"_1st P._ Harry, you can sing. Give us a song."

2573,ACT III.,"All comforts doth forego,"
2574,ACT III.,And here and there
2575,ACT III.,And everywhere
2576,ACT III.,Pursues the prowling foe.

2578,ACT III.,_2nd P._ How like you that?
2579,ACT III.,
2580,ACT III.,"_3rd P._ O, very well. I love to hear anything that touches upon the"

2621,ACT III.,"_All._ Ay, ay; another, another."
2622,ACT III.,
2623,ACT III.,"_2nd P._ I have not many by heart. I do recollect one at present, but it"
2624,ACT III.,was made at the beginning of the war.

2635,ACT III.,But ere I am slaughtered and wrapped in a shroud
2636,ACT III.,I must tell you the motive that makes him so proud.
2637,ACT III.,The monkeys and puppies that bow to his rule

2639,ACT III.,
2640,ACT III.,"They say we are cowards, not dressed in red coats,"
2641,ACT III.,That he without danger may cut all our throats;
2642,ACT III.,"If we see but a Briton, confounded with fear,"
2643,ACT III.,We'll throw down our muskets and run like a deer.
2644,ACT III.,
2645,ACT III.,That one thousand men with a captain would dare

2649,ACT III.,
2650,ACT III.,"Such a motive to fight would you ever conceive,"
2651,ACT III.,Yet such is the motive that makes him so brave.
2652,ACT III.,"On such a presumption, in hopes of applause,"
2653,ACT III.,He whets up his grinders and sharpens his claws.
2654,ACT III.,
2655,ACT III.,"But hark, Mr. Lion, and be not so stout,"
2656,ACT III.,In fancy alone you have put us to rout.

2673,ARNOLD.,_Jeff._ Two hours have hardly yet elapsed since he
2674,ARNOLD.,Across the river to the garrison
2675,ARNOLD.,"On some important business went in haste,"
2676,ARNOLD.,So as I told to his attendant here.
2677,ARNOLD.,For since the general parted I arrived.
2678,ARNOLD.,"Is he, then, at the garrison? by heaven,"
2679,ARNOLD.,We'll have him in a trice.
2680,ARNOLD.,
2681,ARNOLD.,"_Aide._ You'll have him in a trice. Pray, what means that?"
2682,ARNOLD.,
2683,ARNOLD.,"_Jeff._ I see your ignorance, my honest friend."
2684,ARNOLD.,"Why such a damned, unnatural plot has happened"
2685,ARNOLD.,"That when I mention it, if you have feeling,"
2686,ARNOLD.,At the first word your blood must chill with horror
2687,ARNOLD.,And admiration shake your very soul.
2688,ARNOLD.,"This traitor Arnold, this vile, abandoned traitor,"
2689,ARNOLD.,"This monster of ingratitude unequalled,"
2690,ARNOLD.,Has been conspiring with an English spy
2691,ARNOLD.,To render tip the fort to General Clinton.
2692,ARNOLD.,
2693,ARNOLD.,"_Aide._ What fort? the fort at West Point, mean you?"
2694,ARNOLD.,
2695,ARNOLD.,"_Jeff._ The fort at West Point, on my sacred honour,"
2696,ARNOLD.,"The garrison, dependencies, and stores,"
2697,ARNOLD.,"And, what is more, the person of our leader."
2698,ARNOLD.,"Five thousand troops at York are now embarked,"

2700,ARNOLD.,
2701,ARNOLD.,_Aide._ Is this reality; sure you are jesting.
2702,ARNOLD.,And yet you serious seem to be of countenance.
2703,ARNOLD.,"Lips that quiver, eyes that glow with passion,"
2704,ARNOLD.,Tempt me to think your story may be true.
2705,ARNOLD.,And yet I doubt it. Came you here to seize him?
2706,ARNOLD.,
2707,ARNOLD.,"_Jeff._ Nay, doubt it not. I have the papers with me"
2708,ARNOLD.,That at a glance betray this horrid treason.
2709,ARNOLD.,
2710,ARNOLD.,_Aide._ For what could he do this?
2711,ARNOLD.,"Was it Resentment, Avarice, Ambition"
2712,ARNOLD.,That prompted him to act the traitor's part?
2713,ARNOLD.,And yet I'm sure it never could be avarice.
2714,ARNOLD.,His country lavishes her wealth upon him;
2715,ARNOLD.,"He has the income of a little king,"
2716,ARNOLD.,And perquisites that by a hundred ways
2717,ARNOLD.,"Not only the base wants of life supply,"
2718,ARNOLD.,But deck him out in elegance and grandeur.
2719,ARNOLD.,"Perhaps, indeed, he has ambitious views:"
2720,ARNOLD.,"He aims to make his court to Britain's king,"
2721,ARNOLD.,And rise upon the ruins of his country.
2722,ARNOLD.,"Perhaps it is resentment and disgust,"
2723,ARNOLD.,"For many hate him, and have often said"
2724,ARNOLD.,He fattens on the plunder of the public.
2725,ARNOLD.,
2726,ARNOLD.,"_Jeff._ 'Tis avarice, sir, that base, unmanly motive."
2727,ARNOLD.,The glare of British gold has captivated
2728,ARNOLD.,"This hero, as we thought him. What a curse,"
2729,ARNOLD.,"That human souls can of such stuff be moulded,"
2730,ARNOLD.,"That they, foregoing fame and character,"
2731,ARNOLD.,"E'en for the sake of what is despicable,"
2732,ARNOLD.,Be foe to virtue and to virtue's friend.

2738,ARNOLD.,"[33] This fragment of a drama, as far as I can find, was never"

2741,ARNOLD.,"took place which it records. It exists, as far as I know, only in"
2742,ARNOLD.,Freneau's fragmentary and much-revised autograph manuscript now in the
2743,ARNOLD.,possession of Miss Adele M. Sweeney of Jersey City. The arrest of André

2941,ON THE MEMORABLE VICTORY[42],(Almost deserted by his crew)
2942,ON THE MEMORABLE VICTORY[42],And charg'd them deep with woe:

3146,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"Dear Sir, I'm so anxious to hear of your health,"
3147,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],I beg you would send me a letter by stealth:
3148,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"I hope a few months will quite alter the case,"
3149,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"When the wars are concluded, we'll meet and embrace."
3150,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],
3151,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"For I'm led to believe from our brilliant success,"
3152,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"And, what is as clear, your amazing distress,"
3153,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],That the cause of rebellion has met with a check
3154,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],That will bring all its patrons to hang by the neck.
3155,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],
3156,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"Cornwallis has managed so well in the South,"
3157,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],Those rebels want victuals to put in their mouth;
3158,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"And Arnold has stript them, we hear, to the buff[52]--"
3159,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"Has burnt their tobacco, and left them--the snuff."

3161,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"Dear Thomas, I wish you would move from that town"

3163,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"When our armies, victorious, shall clear that vile nest"
3164,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"You may chance, though a Tory, to swing with the rest."
3165,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],
3166,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],But again--on reflection--I beg you would stay--
3167,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],You may serve us yet better than if moved away--
3168,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"Give advice to Sir Harry of all that is passing,"
3169,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"What vessels are building, what cargoes amassing;"
3170,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],

3173,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"By proceedings like these, your peace will be made,"
3174,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"The rebellious shall swing, but be you ne'er afraid."
3175,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],
3176,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],I cannot conceive how you do to subsist--
3177,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"The rebels are starving, except those who 'list;"
3178,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"And as you reside in the land of Gomorrah,"
3179,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"You must fare as the rest do, I think, to your sorrow."

3197,A NEW-YORK TORY[51],"and, supported by the British navy there, committed extensive ravages on"

4975,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Was lately reviewing his papers of state,"
4976,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],He happened to light on the records of Fate:
4977,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
4978,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],In Alphabet order this volume was written--
4979,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"So he opened at B, for the article Britain--"

4981,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],What the sisters in Pluto's dominions decree.
4982,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
4983,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"And first, on the top of a column he read"

4998,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],So Jupiter read--a god of first rank--
4999,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],And still had read on--but he came to a blank:

5007,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5008,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"But still as true genius not frequently fails,"
5009,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"He glanced at the Virgin, and thought of the Scales;"

5012,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5013,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Then turning to Vulcan, his maker of thunder,"

5027,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5028,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Old Vulcan complied, (we've no reason to doubt it)"
5029,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],So he put on his apron and strait went about it--
5030,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Made center, and circles as round as a pancake,"
5031,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"And here the Pacific, and there the Atlantic."
5032,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5033,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"An axis he hammered, whose ends were the poles,"
5034,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],(On which the whole body perpetually rolls)
5035,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"A brazen meridian he added to these,"
5036,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],Where four times repeated were[143] ninety degrees.
5037,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5038,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"I am sure you had laughed to have seen his droll attitude,"

5058,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Vast lakes on her surface did fearfully roll,"
5059,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],And the ice from her rivers surrounded the pole.
5060,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5061,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Then Europe and Asia he northward extended,"

5070,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5071,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"In forming East India, he had a wide scope,"

5075,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],

5287,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"between a brave and magnanimous people, and a most vicious"
5288,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],and vitiating government_. Perhaps the following extract
5289,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],from a pamphlet lately published in London and republished
5290,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"at Baltimore (June, 1809) by Mr. _Bernard Dornin_, will"
5291,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],place the preceding sentiment in a fair point of view:
5292,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],
5293,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"""A better spirit than exists in the English people, never"
5294,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"existed in any people in the world; it has been misdirected,"
5295,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],and squandered upon party purposes in the most degrading and
5296,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],scandalous manner; they have been led to believe that they
5297,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],were benefiting the commerce of England by destroying the
5298,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"commerce of America, that they were defending their"
5299,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],sovereign by perpetuating the bigoted oppression of their
5300,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],fellow subjects; their rulers and their guides have told
5301,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],them that they would equal the vigour of France by equalling
5302,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"her atrocity, and they have gone on, wasting that opulence,"
5303,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"patience and courage, which if husbanded by prudent, and"
5304,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"moderate counsels, might have proved the salvation of"
5305,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],mankind. The same policy of turning the good qualities of
5306,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Englishmen to their own destruction, which made Mr. Pitt"
5307,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"omnipotent, continues his power to those who resemble him"
5308,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],only in his vices; advantage is taken of the loyalty of
5309,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"Englishmen, to make them meanly submissive; their piety is"
5310,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],turned into persecution; their courage into useless and
5311,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],obstinate contention; they are plundered because they are
5312,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"ready to pay, and soothed into assinine stupidity because"
5313,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],they are full of virtuous patience. If England must perish
5314,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"at last, so let it be: that event is in the hands of God; we"
5315,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"must dry up our tears, and submit. But that England should"
5316,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],perish swindling and stealing; that it should perish waging
5317,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],war against lazar-houses and hospitals; that it should
5318,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],perish persecuting with monastic bigotry; that it should
5319,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],calmly give itself up to be ruined by the flashy arrogance
5320,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"of one man, and the narrow fanaticism of another: these"
5321,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],"events are within the power of human beings, but I did not"
5322,THE POLITICAL BALANCE[142],think that the magnanimity of Englishmen would ever stoop to

5827,SONG[157],"Then the _Monk's_ proud flag descended,"
5828,SONG[157],And her cannon ceased to roar;

7537,II.,"[212] The _Freeman's Journal_ of April 24 and May 1, 1782, gives full"
7538,II.,details of the Huddy affair. I can do no better than to quote Freneau's
7539,II.,own version of the episode contributed to the _Journal_ for June 12:
7540,II.,
7541,II.,"""Capt. Huddy, of the Jersey militia, was attacked in a small fort on"
7542,II.,"Tom's river, by a party of refugees in the British pay and service, was"
7543,II.,"made prisoner, together with his company, carried to New York, and"
7544,II.,"lodged in the provost of that city; about three weeks after which, he"
7545,II.,"was taken out of the provost down to the water side, put into a boat and"
7546,II.,"brought again to the Jersey shore, and there, contrary to the practice"
7547,II.,"of all nations but savages, was hung up on a tree [April 8, 1782] and"
7548,II.,"left hanging until found by our people, who took him down and buried"
7549,II.,him.
7550,II.,
7551,II.,"""The inhabitants of that part of the country where the murder was"
7552,II.,"committed, sent a deputation to general Washington, with a full and"
7553,II.,"certified state of the fact. Struck as every human breast must be, with"
7554,II.,"such outrage, and determined both to punish and prevent it for the"
7555,II.,"future, the general represented the case to general Clinton, who then"
7556,II.,"commanded, and demanded that the refugee officer who ordered and"
7557,II.,"attended the execution, and whose name is Lippencut, should be delivered"
7558,II.,"up as a murderer, and in case of refusal that the person of some British"
7559,II.,"officer should suffer in his stead. The demand, though not refused, has"
7560,II.,"not been complied with, and the melancholy lot (not by selection, but by"
7561,II.,"casting lots) has fallen upon captain Asgil of the guards, who, as I"
7562,II.,"have already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to camp, a martyr"
7563,II.,"to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in, and the"
7564,II.,"ingratitude of those he has served."""
7565,II.,
7566,II.,Asgill was finally released.

8250,STANZAS[233],
8251,STANZAS[233],Since memory paints that dismal day

8260,STANZAS[233],
8261,STANZAS[233],"Through barren wastes and ravaged lands,"
8262,STANZAS[233],He led his bold undaunted bands;

8274,STANZAS[233],He freed a world from monsters too.
8275,STANZAS[233],
8276,STANZAS[233],Through every want and every ill

9711,LINES[280],Nor shall the Muse the unenvied gift deny.
9712,LINES[280],Of all the towns that grac'd Jamaica's isle
9713,LINES[280],"This was her glory, and the proudest pile,"
9714,LINES[280],"Where toils on toils bade wealth's gay structures rise,"
9715,LINES[280],And commerce swell'd her glory to the skies:
9716,LINES[280],"St. Jago, seated on a distant plain,"
9717,LINES[280],"Ne'er saw the tall ship entering from the main,"
9718,LINES[280],Unnotic'd streams her Cobra's[B] margin lave
9719,LINES[280],"Where yond' tall plantains shade her glowing wave,"
9720,LINES[280],And burning sands or rock surrounded hill

9722,LINES[280],"While o'er these wastes with wearied step I go,"
9723,LINES[280],"Past scenes of death return, in all their woe,[281]"
9724,LINES[280],"O'er these sad shores in angry pomp he pass'd,"

9728,LINES[280],"Here, piles on piles an instant tore away,"
9729,LINES[280],"Here, crowds on crowds in mingled ruin lay,"
9730,LINES[280],"Whom fate scarce gave to end their noon-day feast,"

9732,LINES[280],"Where yond' tall barque, with all her ponderous load,"

9752,LINES[280],One only inn with tiresome search I found

9756,LINES[280],"His wary eyes on every side were cast,"

9760,LINES[280],No sprightly lads or gay bewitching maids[283]
9761,LINES[280],Walk on these wastes or wander in these shades;
9762,LINES[280],"To other shores past times beheld them go,"
9763,LINES[280],And some are slumbering in the caves below;
9764,LINES[280],"A negro tribe but ill their place supply,"
9765,LINES[280],"With bending back, short hair, and downcast eye;[284]"
9766,LINES[280],"A feeble rampart guards the unlucky town,"
9767,LINES[280],"Where banish'd Tories come to seek renown,"
9768,LINES[280],"Where worn-out slaves their bowls of beer retail,"
9769,LINES[280],And sun-burnt strumpets watch the approaching sail.
9770,LINES[280],Here (scarce escap'd the wild tornado's rage)
9771,LINES[280],Why sail'd I here to swell my future page!
9772,LINES[280],To these dull scenes with eager haste I came
9773,LINES[280],"To trace the reliques of their ancient fame,"
9774,LINES[280],"Not worth the search!--what domes are left to fall,"
9775,LINES[280],"Guns, gales, and earthquakes shall destroy them all--"
9776,LINES[280],"All shall be lost!--tho' hosts their aid implore,"
9777,LINES[280],"The Twelve Apostles[D] shall protect no more,"
9778,LINES[280],Nor guardian heroes awe the impoverish'd plain;
9779,LINES[280],"No priest shall mutter, and no saint remain,"
9780,LINES[280],"Nor this palmetto yield her evening shade,"
9781,LINES[280],"Where the dark negro his dull music play'd,"
9782,LINES[280],Or casts his view beyond the adjacent strand
9783,LINES[280],"And points, still grieving, to his native land,"
9784,LINES[280],"Turns and returns from yonder murmuring shore,"
9785,LINES[280],And pants for countries he must see no more--
9786,LINES[280],"Where shall I go, what Lethe shall I find"
9787,LINES[280],To drive these dark ideas from my mind!
9788,LINES[280],"No buckram heroes can relieve the eye,"
9789,LINES[280],And George's honours only raise a sigh--
9790,LINES[280],"Not even these walls a glad remembrance claim,[285]"
9791,LINES[280],"Where grief still wastes a half deluded dame,"
9792,LINES[280],"Whom to these coasts a British Paris bore,"
9793,LINES[280],"And basely left, lost virtue to deplore.--"
9794,LINES[280],"In foreign climes detain'd from all she lov'd,"
9795,LINES[280],"By friends neglected, long by fortune prov'd,"
9796,LINES[280],"While sad and solemn pass'd the unwelcome day,"
9797,LINES[280],"What charms had life for her, to tempt her stay!"
9798,LINES[280],Deceiv'd in all--for meanness could deceive--
9799,LINES[280],"Expecting still, and still condemn'd to grieve,"
9800,LINES[280],"She scarcely saw, to different hearts allied,"
9801,LINES[280],That her dear Florio ne'er pursued a bride.--
9802,LINES[280],Are griefs like thine to Florio's bosom known?
9803,LINES[280],"Must these, alas, be ceaseless in your own?--"
9804,LINES[280],"Life is a dream--its varying shades I see,"
9805,LINES[280],But this base wanderer hardly dreams of thee.
9806,LINES[280],"Ye mountains vast, whose heights the heaven sustain,"
9807,LINES[280],"Adieu, ye mountains, and fair Kingston's plain;"
9808,LINES[280],Where Nature still the toils of art transcends--
9809,LINES[280],"In this dull spot the fine delusion ends,"
9810,LINES[280],Where burning sands are borne by every blast
9811,LINES[280],And these mean fabrics still bewail the past;
9812,LINES[280],"Where want, and death, and care, and grief reside,"
9813,LINES[280],And threatening moons advance the imperious tide:--
9814,LINES[280],"Ye stormy winds, awhile your wrath suspend,"
9815,LINES[280],"Who leaves the land, a bottle, and a friend,"
9816,LINES[280],"Quits this bright isle for yon' blue seas and sky,"

11073,REED[A],and his early death was much regretted.
11074,REED[A],
11075,REED[A],
11076,REED[A],Soon to the grave[301] descends each honoured name
11077,REED[A],That raised their country to this blaze[302] of fame:
11078,REED[A],"Sages, that planned, and chiefs that led the way"
11079,REED[A],"To Freedom's temple, all too soon decay,"
11080,REED[A],"Alike submit to one impartial[303] doom,"
11081,REED[A],"Their glories closing in perpetual gloom,"
11082,REED[A],"Like the pale[304] splendours of the evening, fade,"
11083,REED[A],"While night advances, to complete the shade."
11084,REED[A],"REED, 'tis for thee we shed the unpurchased tear,"
11085,REED[A],"Bend o'er thy tomb, and plant our laurels there:"
11086,REED[A],"Your acts, your life,[305] the noblest pile transcend,"
11087,REED[A],"And Virtue, patriot Virtue, mourns her friend,"
11088,REED[A],"Gone to those realms, where worth may claim regard,"
11089,REED[A],And gone where virtue meets her best reward.
11090,REED[A],"No single art engaged his vigorous[306] mind,"
11091,REED[A],In every scene his active genius shined:
11092,REED[A],"Nature in him, in honour to our age,"
11093,REED[A],At once composed the soldier and the sage--
11094,REED[A],"Firm to his purpose, vigilant, and bold,"
11095,REED[A],"Detesting traitors, and despising gold,"
11096,REED[A],He scorned all bribes from Britain's hostile throne
11097,REED[A],For all his country's wrongs he held[307] his own.
11098,REED[A],"REED, rest in peace: for time's impartial page"
11099,REED[A],Shall raise the blush on[308] this ungrateful age:
11100,REED[A],"Long in these climes thy name shall flourish fair,"
11101,REED[A],"The statesman's pattern, and the poet's care;"
11102,REED[A],"Long in these climes[309] thy memory shall remain,"
11103,REED[A],"And still new tributes from new ages gain,"
11104,REED[A],Fair to the eye that injured honour rise--
11105,REED[A],Nor traitors triumph while the patriot dies.

11140,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],From the clime of New Scotland we wish you to know
11141,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"We still are in being--mere spectres of woe,"

11143,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11144,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Great people we are, and are called the king's friends;"
11145,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],But on friendships like these what advantage attends?
11146,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],We may stay and be starved[311] when we've answered his ends!
11147,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11148,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"The Indians themselves, whom no treaties can bind,"
11149,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],We have reason to think are perversely inclined--
11150,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And where we have friends is not easy to find.
11151,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11152,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],From the day we arrived on this desolate shore
11153,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"We still have been wishing to see you once more,"
11154,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"And your freedom enjoy, now the danger is o'er."
11155,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11156,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Although we be-rebelled you up hill and down,"
11157,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],It was all for your good--and to honour a crown
11158,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Whose splendours have spoiled better eyes than our own.
11159,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11160,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"That traitors we were, is no more than our due,"
11161,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"And so may remain for a century through,"
11162,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Unless we return, and be tutored by you."
11163,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11164,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Although with the dregs of the world we are classed,"
11165,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"We hope your resentment will soften at last,"
11166,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Now your toils are repaid, and our triumphs are past."
11167,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11168,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"When a matter is done, 'tis a folly to fret--"
11169,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"But your market-day mornings we cannot forget,"
11170,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"With your coaches to lend, and your horses to let."
11171,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11172,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Your dinners of beef, and your breakfasts of toast!"
11173,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"But we have no longer such blessings to boast,"
11174,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"No cattle to steal, and no turkies to roast."
11175,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11176,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Such enjoyments as these, we must tell you with pain,"
11177,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],'Tis odds we shall only be wishing in vain
11178,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Unless we return, and be brothers again."
11179,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11180,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"We burnt up your mills and your meetings, 'tis true,"
11181,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And many bold fellows we crippled and slew--
11182,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],(Aye! we were the boys that had something to do!)
11183,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11184,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Old Huddy[312] we hung on the Neversink shore--
11185,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"But, Sirs, had we hung up a thousand men more,"
11186,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"They had all been avenged in the torments we bore,"
11187,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11188,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"When Asgill to Jersey you foolishly fetched,"
11189,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"And each of us feared that his neck would be stretched,"
11190,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"When you were be-rebelled, and we were be-wretched."
11191,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11192,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],In the book of destruction it seems to be written
11193,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],The Tories must still be dependent on Britain--
11194,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],The worst of dependence that ever was hit on.
11195,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11196,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Now their work is concluded--that pitiful jobb--
11197,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],They send over convicts to strengthen our mob--
11198,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And so we do nothing but snivel and sob.
11199,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11200,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"The worst of all countries has fallen to our share,"
11201,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Where winter and famine provoke our despair,"
11202,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And fogs are for ever obscuring the air.
11203,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11204,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Although there be nothing but sea dogs to feed on,"
11205,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Our friend Jemmy Rivington made it an Eden--
11206,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"But, alas! he had nothing but lies to proceed on."
11207,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11208,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Deceived we were all by his damnable schemes--
11209,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"When he coloured it over with gardens and streams,"
11210,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"And grottoes and groves, and the rest of his dreams."
11211,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11212,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Our heads were so turned by that conjuror's spell,"
11213,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],We swallowed the lies he was ordered to tell--
11214,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"But his ""happy retreats"" were the visions of hell."
11215,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11216,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"We feel so enraged we could rip up his weazon,"
11217,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"When we think of the soil he described with its trees on,"
11218,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"And the plenty that reigned, and the charms of each season."
11219,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11220,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Like a parson that tells of the joys of the blest
11221,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],To a man to be hanged--he himself thought it best
11222,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"To remain where he was, in his haven of rest."
11223,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11224,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Since he helped us away by the means of his types,"
11225,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"His precepts should only have lighted our pipes,"
11226,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],His example was rather to honour your stripes.
11227,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11228,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Now, if we return, as we're bone of your bone,"
11229,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],We'll renounce all allegiance to George and his throne
11230,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And be the best subjects that ever were known.
11231,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11232,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"In a ship, you have seen (where the duty is hard)"
11233,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"The cook and the scullion may claim some regard,"
11234,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],Though it takes a good fellow to brace the main yard.
11235,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11236,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Howe'er you despise us, because you are free,"
11237,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"The world's at a loss for such people as we,"
11238,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"Who can pillage on land, and can plunder at sea."
11239,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11240,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],So long for our rations they keep us in waiting--
11241,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"The Lords and the Commons, perhaps, are debating"
11242,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],If Tories can live without drinking or eating.
11243,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],
11244,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],"So we think it is better to see you, by far--"
11245,A RENEGADO EPISTLE[310],And have hinted our meaning to governor Parr[A]--

12032,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],among the selected poetry and assigned to P. Freneau. This testimony of
12033,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],Carey's as to its genuineness carries with it considerable weight.
12034,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"Knapp, who in 1829 reviewed the poem as Freneau's, doubtless had before"
12035,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"him a copy of the _Museum_. The poem, however, is not included in any of"
12036,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"the poet's collections and I can find no earlier newspaper appearance,"
12037,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],although my search has not been exhaustive. The authenticity of a poem
12038,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],suspected to be Freneau's may always be gravely doubted if it is not
12039,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"found to be included in his collected works, for he hoarded his poetic"
12040,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"product, especially in his earlier period, with miserly care."
12041,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],
12042,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],The poem appeared in 1806 among the poems of Mrs. John Hunter with the

12046,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"introduced the poem into her book ""Rosamond,"" ascribing it to her. She"
12047,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],"added the following note: ""The idea of this ballad was suggested several"
12048,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],years ago by hearing a gentleman who resided many years among the tribe

12050,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],for these people to chant with a barbarous jargon implying contempt for
12051,THE DEATH SONG OF A CHEROKEE INDIAN[325],their enemies in the moments of torture and death. I have endeavored to

12259,THE BERMUDA ISLANDS[331],"Reading,"" 1788, and in the following series of poems, composed at"

12262,THE BERMUDA ISLANDS[331],that it was the daughter of this official who was the unfortunate

12274,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],Forced from your aid by cold December's gale
12275,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],As near your isle we reefed the wearied sail:
12276,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"From bar to bar, from cape to cape I roam,"
12277,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"From you still absent, still too far from home.--"
12278,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"What shall repay me for these nights of pain,"

12284,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],What sad mistake this wandering fancy drew
12285,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"To quit my natives shores, the woods, and You,"
12286,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"When safely anchored on that winding stream,"
12287,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"Where you were all my care, and all my theme:"
12288,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"There, pensive, loitering, still from day to day,"
12289,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"The pilot wondered at such strange delay,"
12290,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"Musing, beheld the northern winds prevail,"

12295,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],Stretched his broad canvas o'er a waste of seas;
12296,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"And taught some swain, whom absence doomed to mourn"
12297,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],His distant fair one--taught a quick return:
12298,FLORIO TO AMANDA[332],"He, homeward borne by favouring gales, might find"

12354,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Philander to a barbarous region came
12355,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And found a partner in a colder shade,"
12356,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Fair as Amanda; and perhaps might claim
12357,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"With her the impassion'd soul, and friendship's holy flame;"
12358,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"For sprightly loves upon her bosom play'd,"
12359,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And youth was in her blush, and every shepherd said"
12360,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],She was a modest and accomplish'd dame.
12361,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"What have I done, (the wandering shepherd cry'd)"
12362,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Thus to be banish'd from a face so fair,"
12363,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"(For now the frosts had spoil'd the daisies' pride,"

12365,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Ah, what have I to do with swelling seas"
12366,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Who once could pipe upon the hollow reed?--
12367,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"I take no joy in such rude scenes as these,"
12368,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Nor look with pleasure on the vagrant weed

12370,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Which floats thro' every clime, and never finds a shore!"
12371,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"But other fields and other flowers were mine,"
12372,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],'Till wild disorder drove me from the plain.
12373,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And the black dogs of war were seen to join,"
12374,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Howl o'er the soil, and dispossess the swain:"
12375,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Why must I leave these climes of frost and snow?--

12381,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"That I must leave these shores, and lose these lands"
12382,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And southward to the high equator stray:
12383,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],But Fancy now has lost her vernal hue;
12384,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],See Nature in her wintry garb array'd--
12385,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And where is that fine dream which once she drew

12408,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"While the broad topsails, from the yards unfurl'd,"
12409,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Shook in the wind, and summon'd him away;"
12410,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Brisk blew the gales, and curl'd the yielding flood,"
12411,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Nor had he one excuse to urge his stay--
12412,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Be chang'd (he said) ye winds that blow so fair;
12413,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Why do not tempests harrow up the deep,"
12414,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And all but the moist south in quiet sleep!
12415,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],
12416,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"To the bleak shore the parting lovers came,"
12417,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And while Philander did his sighs renew,"
12418,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],So near the deep they bade their last farewell
12419,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"That the rough surge, to quench the mutual flame"
12420,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Burst in and broke the embrace, and o'er Lavinia flew;"
12421,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"While a dark cloud hung lowering o'er the main,"
12422,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"From whence the attendants many an omen drew,"
12423,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And said Philander would not come again!
12424,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],
12425,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Now to their various heights the sails ascend,"
12426,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And southward from the land their course they bore.
12427,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Lavinia mourn'd the lover and the friend,"
12428,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And stood awhile upon the sandy shore,"
12429,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"'Till interposing seas the hull conceal'd,"
12430,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And distant sails could only greet her view,"
12431,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Like a faint cloud that brush'd the watery field,"
12432,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And swell'd by whistling winds, impetuous, flew:"
12433,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Then to a neighbouring hill the nymph withdrew,"
12434,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And the dear object from that height survey'd,"
12435,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"'Till all was lost and mingled with the main,"
12436,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And night descended, with her gloomy shade,"
12437,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And kindled in the heavens her starry train.
12438,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],
12439,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Safe to the south the ocean-wading keel
12440,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"In one short month its rapid course achiev'd,"
12441,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"And the cold star, that marks the Arctic pole,"
12442,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],Was in the bosom of the deep receiv'd:
12443,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And now the weary barque at anchor rode
12444,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Where Oronoko pours his sultry wave,"
12445,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"Moist Surinam, by torrents overflow'd,"
12446,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],And Amazonia vends the fainting slave;--

12450,PHILANDER: OR THE EMIGRANT[333],"The vertic sun a deadly fever gave,"

12532,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"She sighed, and said--I am not for you!"
12533,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],
12534,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"When drooping, dull, and almost dead"
12535,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"With fevers brought from sultry climes,"
12536,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],She would not wrap my fainting head;
12537,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],But recommended me some rhymes
12538,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"On patience and on fortitude,"
12539,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],And other things--less understood.
12540,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],
12541,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"When, aiming to engage her heart"
12542,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],With verses from the muses' stock;
12543,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"She sighed, regardless of the art,"
12544,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],And counted seconds by the clock;
12545,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"""And thus, (she said) will verse decay,"
12546,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"""And thus the muse will pass away!"""
12547,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],
12548,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],When languishing upon her bed
12549,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"In willow shades, remote from towns,"
12550,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],We came; and while Priscilla read
12551,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],Of chrystal skies and golden crowns:
12552,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"She bade us at a distance stand,"
12553,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],And leaned her head upon her hand.
12554,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],
12555,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"So, drooping hangs the fading rose,"
12556,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],When summer sends the beating shower:
12557,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"So, to the grave Amanda goes,"
12558,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],Her whole duration--but an hour!
12559,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"Who shall controul the sad decree,"
12560,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"Or what, fair girl, recover thee?"
12561,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],
12562,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],Such virtue in that spirit dwells--
12563,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],Such fortitude amidst such pain!--
12564,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"And, now, with pride my bosom swells,"
12565,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],To think I have not lived in vain.
12566,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],"For, slighting all the sages knew,"
12567,AMANDA IN A CONSUMPTION[335],I learn philosophy from you.

13139,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13140,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A singer of ballads was next in our train,"
13141,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Who long had been dealing in ballads in vain;
13142,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He sometimes would sing in a musical tone,"
13143,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And sometimes would scribble a song of his own:
13144,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Yet never was seen with his brethren to mix--
13145,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And laugh'd at your poets in coaches and six;
13146,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Who sing, like the birds, when the weather is fine;"
13147,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Whose verses the ladies pronounce ""so divine;"""
13148,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Who ride with Augustus, wherever he goes,"
13149,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And, meeting old Homer, would turn up the nose--"
13150,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"As to those, like himself, that were held to the ground,"
13151,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,He knew it was folly to feed them with sound--
13152,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He knew it was nonsense to crown them with bays,"
13153,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And was too much their friend to insult them with praise.
13154,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,For a dozen long years he had liv'd by the mob:
13155,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"On the word of a weaver, I pitied poor Bob![361]"
13156,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He had sung for the great and had rhym'd for the small,"
13157,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But scarcely a shilling had got by them all--
13158,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"So bad was his luck, and so poor was the trade,"
13159,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And the Muses, he thought, were so sneakingly paid,"
13160,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That if times didn't alter, and that very soon,"
13161,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He said and he swore, he must sing his last tune."
13162,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Some devil had put it, somehow, in his head"
13163,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,If he took a short journey his fortune was made:
13164,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Some devil had told him (but whether in dreams
13165,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Or waking, I know not) some devil, it seems,"
13166,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Had made him believe that the nymphs and the swains
13167,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Were fairly at war with their old fashion'd strains,"
13168,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,That the tunes which the kirk or the curates had made
13169,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,(And which always had ruin'd the balladman's trade)
13170,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Were wholly disus'd, and that now was the time"
13171,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,For singers of catches and dealers in rhyme
13172,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"To step from their stalls, where they long were disgrac'd,"
13173,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Reform the old music, and fix a new taste."

13177,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13178,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A mate of a schooner, bespatter'd with tar,"
13179,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Who had lately come in from Savanna-la-Mar,[F]"
13180,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"For, the sake of an airing had stept from his deck"
13181,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And ventur'd a jaunt, at the risque of his neck,"
13182,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,His name and his nation no soul could mistake.--
13183,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He was Bryan O'Bluster, and much of a rake;"
13184,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"From morning till night he was still on the move,"
13185,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Was always in taverns, or always in love:"
13186,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His life was sustain'd by the virtues of grog,"
13187,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And many long miles he had sail'd by the log.--
13188,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Of battles and storms he had known a full share,"
13189,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And his face, it was plain, was the worse for the wear;"
13190,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"To see a mean fellow, lord how it would fret him;"
13191,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And he hated a puppy, wherever he met him--"
13192,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He was ready to bleed for the good of each State,"
13193,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But since they had left the poor seamen to fate;
13194,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Themselves in the dumps, and their fair ones in tears,"
13195,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And many brave fellows detain'd in Algiers!--
13196,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Had spirit sufficient to make themselves free,"
13197,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But not to resent their affronts on the sea!
13198,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"As this was the case--he must bid us good night,"
13199,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And sail with a flag that would do itself right.
13200,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"At cursing and swearing he play'd a good hand,"
13201,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But never was easy a minute on land;
13202,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"If the wind was a-head, or his Kitty untrue,"
13203,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Why, patience was all the relief that he knew:--"
13204,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In the midst of misfortune he still was serene,"
13205,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And Kitty, he said, was a feeble machine:"
13206,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His heart was too hard for a lady to sigh,"
13207,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Yet I guess'd him a rogue by the leer in his eye:
13208,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""The world (he would say) is a whimsical dance--"
13209,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And reason had taught him to leave it to chance.
13210,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In chace of dame Fortune his prime he had pass'd,"
13211,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And now was beginning to fail very fast,"
13212,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But thought it was folly his heart to perplex,"
13213,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,As Fortune was just like the rest of her sex;--
13214,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Designing, and fickle, and taken with show,"
13215,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Now fond of a monkey, and now of a beau:--"
13216,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Yet, still, as the goddess was made up of whim,"
13217,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He meant to pursue 'till she smil'd upon him."""
13218,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And tho' he was always deceiv'd in the chace,"
13219,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He smooth'd up his whiskers, and wore a bold face."
13220,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"On horseback he first had attempted to go,"
13221,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But the horse was no fool, and had give him a throw;"
13222,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He fell in a pond, and with not a dry rag on"
13223,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The horse brought him back to the sign of the waggon,"
13224,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where three times he call'd for a dram of their best,"
13225,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And three times the virtues of brandy confess'd;
13226,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then took some tobacco, and soberly said,"
13227,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""De'il take such a vessel; she's all by the head,"
13228,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Broach'd to on a sudden, and then, d'ye see,"
13229,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Myself and the saddle went over the lee."""
13230,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,His head was so full of his ragged command
13231,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,He could scarcely believe he was yet on dry land;
13232,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He would rise in his sleep; call the watch up at four,"
13233,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Ask the man at the helm how the Eddystone bore;
13234,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then, rubbing his eyes, bawl out, ""By my soul,"
13235,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""We are bearing right down on the Hatteras shoal;"
13236,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""The devil may trust to such pilots as you:"
13237,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""We are close on the breakers--the breakers--halloo!"""

13244,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13245,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The sixth, and the last, that attended our journey,"
13246,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Was a man of the law, a Rhode-Island attorney,"
13247,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"As cunning as Satan to argue or plead,"
13248,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"To break an entailment, or get himself fee'd"
13249,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,They call'd him Ezekiel--I cannot tell what--
13250,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Perhaps I forget it--perhaps I do not--
13251,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He had once been a parson, and studied at Yale,[G]"
13252,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But took to the law, when his preaching grew stale;"
13253,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In his system of thinking, not well understood,"
13254,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I wander'd about, like a man in a wood;"
13255,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"From morning 'till night he was nothing but whim,"
13256,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Not a man in the town held opinions, like him:"
13257,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In regard to the vulgar, he argued that Law"
13258,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Was better than preaching, to keep them in awe:"
13259,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That the dread of a gallows had greater effect,"
13260,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And a post or a pillory claim'd more respect
13261,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"From a knave--and would sooner contribute to mend,"

13270,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,On the mode of conveyance--in waggon or boat?
13271,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"For my part, said Snip, I was always afraid"
13272,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Of sailors, and sloops and the shallopman's trade,"
13273,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And the reason thereof I will candidly tell,"

13281,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But, gentlemen all, will you take my advice?"
13282,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Here's Albertson's[H] sloop; she's so new and so nice,"
13283,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Her bottom so sleek, and her rigging so trim,"
13284,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Not Bailey[H] or Hyde[H] can be mentioned with him;
13285,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In her cabbin and steerage is plenty of room,"
13286,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And how clever she looks with her flying jib-boom,"
13287,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A topsail aloft, that will stand by the wind,"

13294,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Nor balance a mizen, to fight with the gale:"

13303,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I should then be a widow, dejected and sad"

13321,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I would sleep over night at the sign of the Queen,[I]"
13322,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"(Where the wine is so good, and the beds are so clean)"
13323,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then starting by day-break, and riding in state,"
13324,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Arriving in Bristol--we breakfast at eight,"
13325,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then push on our way, with a rapid career,"
13326,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"With nothing to hinder, and nothing to fear,"
13327,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Till Trenton, and Princeton, and Brunswick are pass'd,"

13329,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When the captain had finish'd, the Frenchman arose,"
13330,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And smoothing his whiskers, and squaring his toes,"
13331,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"With a bend of his back, and a swing of his head"
13332,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Thus expressing his wish, with a flourish, he said:"

13345,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When I blew on my trumpet, and call'd up my pack,"

13354,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,(For his journey resembles our journey below)
13355,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Like the sects in religion, I heartily pray"

13433,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"It was a fit season for murders and rapes,"
13434,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,For drunken adventures and narrow escapes:--
13435,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"So, with something to think of, but little to say,"
13436,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The driver drove on, looking out for the way,"
13437,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"'Till we came to the brow of a horrible hill,"
13438,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Six miles on our road, when the cattle stood still--"
13439,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""Are you sure you have took the right road?""--queried Snip;"
13440,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""I am""--said the driver--and crack'd with his whip."
13441,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then away ran the horses, but took the wrong road,"
13442,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And away went the waggon, with all its full load;"
13443,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Down, deep in a valley, roll'd over and over,"
13444,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Fell the flying-machine, with its curtains and cover,"
13445,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where shatter'd and shiver'd--no glimpse yet of day,"
13446,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A mass of destruction, together we lay!"
13447,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then howlings were heard, that would frighten a stone,"
13448,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And screeching, and screaming, and many a groan,"
13449,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The bruising of heads, and the breaking of shins,"
13450,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Contrition of heart, and confession of sins."
13451,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"First rose from his ruins tall captain O'Keef,"
13452,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And call'd to Ezekiel, and begg'd for his brief:[J]"
13453,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A writ he demanded, as soon as 'twas day,"
13454,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And ask'd his advice, if a suit would not lay?"
13455,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then felt for his sword, but chanc'd on a cane,"
13456,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And rush'd at the stageman, to cleave him in twain."
13457,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"As fortune would have it, the stageman had fled,"
13458,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And Snip the whole vengeance receiv'd on his head;
13459,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,The staff had been whirl'd with so deadly a sweep
13460,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Poor Will in a moment was all in a heap:
13461,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"There was room to surmise that his senses were hurt,"
13462,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"For, in spite of our bruises, he made us some sport:"
13463,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His head, he conceited, was made of new cheese;"
13464,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And ask'd, if the sexton would give up his fees?--"
13465,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then, rolling away on the side of the hill,"
13466,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"With his head in a horse-pond, he lay very still:"
13467,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"At last he bawl'd out--""I'm sick at my heart!"
13468,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Come hither, companions, and see me depart!"
13469,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Snipinda, Snipinda!--alas, I must leave her--"
13470,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And all, for the sake of this villainous weaver,"
13471,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Who never would give me a moment of rest
13472,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"'Till I left my dear shop-board, and thus am distrest!"
13473,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But a time will arrive (if I deem not amiss)
13474,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When Slender, the weaver, will suffer for this--"
13475,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"May his breeches, be always too big for his wear,"
13476,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Or so narrow and scant as to torture his rear;
13477,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"May his waistcoat be ever too long or too short,"
13478,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And the skirts of his tunic not both of a sort;--
13479,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And, when from this sorrowful jaunt you return,"
13480,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Tell Doctor Sangrado 'tis needless to mourn:
13481,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Ah! tell him I firmly believ'd I was going
13482,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where people no longer are wed-ding and wooing,"
13483,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where white linen stockings will ever be clean,"
13484,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And sky-men are clad in the best of nankeen;
13485,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where with old Continental our debts we can pay,"
13486,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And a suit of best broad-cloth will last but a day;
13487,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where with pretty brass thimbles the streets are all pav'd,"
13488,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And a remnant--if not a whole piece--shall be sav'd,"
13489,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Where cloth may be cabbag'd--and that without fear--
13490,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And journeymen work--thirteen months to the year!"""
13491,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Snipinda was mov'd at so dismal a yell,"
13492,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And groping about to find where he fell,"
13493,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Exclaim'd, ""I have got a sad bruise on one hip,"
13494,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But matters, I fear, are much worse with poor Snip."""
13495,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""Yes, yes""--answer'd Snip--""I'm preparing to go--"
13496,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Be speedy, Snipinda, my pulse is so low!"""
13497,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then she went where he lay, and took hold of his head,"
13498,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And whisper'd the captain, ""how much he has bled!"""
13499,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"(For she thought, as he lay with his nose in the puddle,"
13500,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That the water was blood, that had flow'd from his noddle.)"
13501,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""Ah! where is the doctor, to give him a pill;"
13502,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And where is the Lawyer, to write his last-will?"
13503,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Ezekiel! Ezekiel! attend to his words;
13504,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"If I am his widow, I must have my thirds!"
13505,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But can you""--and here she reclin'd on his breast--"
13506,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""And can you resolve to forsake me distrest,"
13507,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Is it thus you would quit me, my joy and my love,"
13508,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And leave me alone for the shop-boards above:
13509,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Is it thus you consign me to trouble and woe?--
13510,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When you are departed, ah! where shall I go?"
13511,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,I shall then be a widow--forsaken and sad--
13512,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And where shall I find such another sweet lad?
13513,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Who then will afford me a mint-water dram,"
13514,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Gallant me to meeting--and who will flog Sam?"""
13515,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"By this time the story was currently spread,"
13516,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And most were convinc'd that the taylor was dead,--"
13517,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""The taylor is dead beyond all relief!"
13518,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The taylor is dead,"" cry'd captain O'Keef:"
13519,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""To fetch up a fashion, or trump up a whim,"

13521,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""The taylor is dead""--(the lawyer exclaim'd)"
13522,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,God speed him!--'tis better to die than be maim'd:
13523,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"If life is a race, as the learned pretend,"
13524,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,God help him! his racing is soon at an end:
13525,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His anchor is cast, and his canvas is furl'd;"
13526,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A creature he was, so attach'd to the world,"
13527,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,So eager for money--(I say it with grief)
13528,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,He never consider'd the 'fall of the leaf.'
13529,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,He is come (we may say) to the end of his tether
13530,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Where the maid and her master shall lay down together.--
13531,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"For the place where he's gone may we also prepare,"
13532,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Where the Mind, when admitted, shall rest from her care,"
13533,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And fiddles--the finest that ever were seen,"
13534,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Shall play, for his comfort, a brisk Bonny Jean."

13538,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When the sailor bawl'd out--""By my soul it's a lie!"
13539,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The fellow has only a mind for some fun,"
13540,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His blood is not cold, and his race is not run."
13541,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"His head, it is true, may have had a small shock:"
13542,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,I'll bind it--'twill only be strapping a block:
13543,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Here, hand me a neck-cloth, a napkin, a clout!"
13544,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Now--heave up his noddle, and strap it about!"
13545,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Success to the skull that can bear a good jirk--

13547,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The matters turn'd out as he said and he swore,"

13554,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,XI. CONCLUSION _of the Journey_
13555,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13556,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When the morning appear'd, it is horrid to tell"
13557,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,What mischiefs the most of our crew had befel:
13558,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A bundle lay here, and a budget lay there;"
13559,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The Frenchman was fretting and pulling his hair,"
13560,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The horses were feeding about on the hill,"
13561,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And Snip, with his head on a hassock lay still,"
13562,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The driver beseech'd us the fault to excuse,"
13563,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The night had been dark--and ""he lost both his shoes""--"
13564,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then he rais'd up his waggon, rejoicing to find"
13565,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That, by leaving the top and the curtains behind,"
13566,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"We still might proceed--for the body was sound,"
13567,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And the wheels, upon searching, uninjur'd all 'round."
13568,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But dull and dishearten'd we travell'd along,"
13569,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Our waggon dismantled, our harness all wrong:"
13570,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The lawyer was vext that we went a snail's pace,"
13571,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And Cynthia was sure she had lost half her lace;
13572,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"While Bryan O'Bluster, who Snip had restor'd,"
13573,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Asserted, that Snip was the Jonas on board,"
13574,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And often declar'd, in his moments of glee,"
13575,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""He would give him a souse, if he had him at sea."""
13576,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"At length, we arriv'd, with the marks of our fall,"
13577,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And halted to dine at the town of Road-Hall:
13578,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Honest David has always a dish of the best,"
13579,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But Snipinda declar'd there was nothing well drest--
13580,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""And Snip (she exclaim'd) I would ask him to eat,"
13581,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But I know that he never could relish roast-meat:
13582,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I think it were better to get him some Tea,"
13583,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He always was fond of slop dinners, like me,"
13584,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But then he could never endure your Bohea--
13585,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"La! madam, is this the best tea that you keep?"
13586,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"By the taste and the smell, you have purchas'd it cheap!"
13587,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,No Hyson or Congo to give a sick stranger!
13588,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Poor man! I've no doubt but his life is in danger!
13589,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13590,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""No doctor like Neptune for people like him,"
13591,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,(Quoth O'Bluster)--his illness is merely a whim:
13592,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"If I had him at sea, with the rest of our crew,"
13593,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He should dance to the tune of a bowl of Burgoo!"""
13594,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13595,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""From all that appears (said captain O'Keef)"
13596,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I judge he might venture to taste the roast beef,"
13597,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Nay--I think I can guess, from the cast of his eye,"
13598,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He longs to have hold of the gooseberry pye!"""
13599,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""Why captain (she cry'd) would you kill the poor sinner?"
13600,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"If he cannot have tea, he shall go without dinner!"""
13601,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13602,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"At length to the Ferry we safely arrive,"
13603,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Each thanking his genius he still was alive:
13604,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Poor Cynthia complain'd of abundance of harms,"
13605,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,The black on her face and the blue on her arms:
13606,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Snipinda exclaim'd that she wanted a patch,"
13607,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"For Snip, in his ravings, had give her a scratch:"
13608,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The corpse of the captain was merely a wreck,"
13609,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And the sailor complain'd of a kink in his neck,"
13610,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He had a contusion, beside, on his thigh;"
13611,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And the ballad-man talk'd of a bruise on his eye,"
13612,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Just adding, ""how much he was vext at the heart"
13613,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,That no one regarded the song-singing art:
13614,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Yet the town was in love with his music (he said)
13615,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,But never consider'd he liv'd by the trade;
13616,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That affronts and neglect were forever his lot,"
13617,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,And the lovers of music respected him--not;
13618,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He had sung for the nymphs, and had sung for the swains,"
13619,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"But they were unwilling to purchase his strains,"
13620,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"When he put up his ballads and call'd for his pay,"
13621,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The shepherds slunk off, and the nymphs ran away."""
13622,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13623,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"So, we said what we could to encourage poor Bob,"
13624,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And pitied his fortune,--to live by the mob:"
13625,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Advis'd him to cobble, cut throats, or dig ditches"
13626,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,If he wish'd to advance to perferment and riches;
13627,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"That the time had arriv'd, when a sycophant race"
13628,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Of poets are only promoted to place--
13629,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"He should scorn them alike, if attach'd to a crown,"
13630,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Singing lies to a court, or disguis'd in the gown;"
13631,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,That a poet of genius (all history shews)
13632,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Ne'er wanted a puppy, to bark at his muse:"
13633,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And, though their productions were never once read,"
13634,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Yet Bavius and Mevius must also be fed.
13635,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Then the skipper came in, with a terrible noise,"
13636,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Exclaiming, ""The wherry is ready, my boys:"
13637,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The sails are unfurl'd, and the clock has struck eight;"
13638,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Away to the wharf, for no longer I wait!"""
13639,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Now all were embark'd, and the boat under sail,"
13640,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,With a dark cloudy sky and a stiff blowing gale:
13641,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,In plying to windward we delug'd our decks--
13642,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,O'Bluster discours'd of disasters and wrecks--
13643,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Snip offer'd the skipper five dollars, and more,"
13644,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And a pair of new trowsers, to run us on shore;"
13645,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""And, if I was there (said the faint-hearted swain)"
13646,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,No money should tempt me to travel again!
13647,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"I had rather, by far, I had broken both legs,"
13648,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Been rotting in prison, or pelted with eggs!"
13649,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Now comrades and captains, I bid you good night,"
13650,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And you, Mr. Slender, our journey will write;"
13651,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"A journey like this will attention attract,"
13652,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Related in metre, and known to be fact.""--"
13653,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Snipinda was sorry she ever left home--
13654,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Ezekiel confess'd it was madness to roam;--
13655,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Toupee was alarm'd at the break of the seas,"
13656,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And you, Robert Slender, were not at your ease;"
13657,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Yet couldn't help laughing at captain O'Keef,"
13658,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Who shunn'd little Cynthia, and cast up his beef:"
13659,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"""And, Bruin (she said) I am sick at my heart,"
13660,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Come hither, I pray you--and see me depart:"
13661,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,What wretches e'er travell'd so rugged a route;
13662,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Alas! I am sorry that e'er we set out!"""
13663,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And Sam, while he own'd what a thief he had been,"
13664,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,O'Bluster made love to a bottle of gin--
13665,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Bob's ballads and poems lay scatter'd and torn
13666,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Himself in the dumps and his visage forlorn;--
13667,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Snip lay with his head by the side of a pot,"
13668,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"In doubt if his soul was departing or not,"
13669,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Complaining, and spewing, and cursing his luck--"
13670,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Then look'd at Snipinda--and call'd her his duck.
13671,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"At last to relieve us, when thought of the least,"
13672,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"The wind came about to the south of southeast,"
13673,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,The barque that was buried in billows before
13674,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"Now flew like a gull by the Long-Island shore,"
13675,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"And gaining the port where we wish'd to arrive,"
13676,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,Was safe in the bason--precisely at five.
13677,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13678,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,
13679,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"[360] First published in pamphlet form by Bailey, April, 1787, under the"
13680,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"title, ""A Journey from Philadelphia to New-York by way of Burlington and"
13681,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"South-Amboy. By Robert Slender, Stocking Weaver."" The advertisement in"
13682,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"the _Freeman's Journal_ of April 25 declares that ""Some truth in the"
13683,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,occasion and a good deal of fancy in the colouring mark the character of
13684,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,the above performance. The style is smooth and easy and the pleasurable
13685,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,air that is diffused over the whole piece will certainly render the
13686,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"whole poem acceptable to such as choose to read it."" The poem was"
13687,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"republished in the editions of 1788 and 1795, the text of the latter of"
13688,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,which I have used. It was again republished in a twenty-four page
13689,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"pamphlet by Thomas Neversink, Philadelphia, Dec. 20, 1809, under the"
13690,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"title ""A Laughable Poem; or Robert Slender's Journey from Philadelphia"
13691,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"to New York."" The earlier versions, of which the 1788 text was a"
13692,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"reprint, had the poem divided into four cantos. In the 1795 edition the"
13693,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,subdivision into sections was made. Freneau thoroughly revised the poem
13694,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"for the 1795 edition, making very many changes, all for the better. He"
13695,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,cut out nearly all of the indelicate allusions and expressions of the
13696,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"earlier edition, including the coarse but highly picturesque dialogue"
13697,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,"between the skipper and the captain, and it has seemed best to me not to"
13698,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,resurrect them. The 1809 edition was reprinted with little change from
13699,I. PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS,the 1795 version.

13725,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Though many years on these tall cliffs residing
13726,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],I recollect not such a dreadful quarrel
13727,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Between the seas and water-vexing tempests
13728,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"As now torments my ears, and pains my eyes--"
13729,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Clouds, low suspended, seem to embrace the foam"
13730,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Of yonder angry ocean--bursting thunders,"
13731,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"With their pale sheets of lightning, are as busy"
13732,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"As though they meant to cleave this mass of nature,"
13733,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Proving at once the world's mortality--
13734,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"But am I safe on this sea-girded island,"
13735,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Or can these shores, thus beaten, bear the shock"
13736,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Of such a bold assault--?
13737,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"When universal ruin shall approach,"
13738,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Will the grand scene be more astonishing
13739,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"When thou, sky-pointing Saba,"
13740,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Shalt tremble on thy base most fearfully!--
13741,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Night comes!--I'll to my cavern in the mountain,"
13742,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Far from the torrent's roar and bursting billow;
13743,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"That cavern, where I oft have found repose"
13744,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Since on this barren isle, a shipwrecked stranger,"
13745,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],I made my sole escape--Ha! what are these!
13746,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],A barque half buried in the spouting surge
13747,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Comes rushing towards the isle, impelled by winds"
13748,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],That scorn all motives of compassion.
13749,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Hark! now she strikes the iron pointed reef
13750,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Foundering; the horrid surge that breaks upon her
13751,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Has sealed their doom, and hope itself forsakes them"
13752,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Man is too weak to combat with the power
13753,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Of these mad elements, that conquer all,"
13754,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Ending the day light of our misery!--
13755,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Yes, yes--I'll to my haunt, for scenes like these"
13756,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Pain the shocked soul and damp all resolution;--
13757,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Or, shall I to the shore, while day remains,"
13758,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And search among the shell-incrusted coral,"
13759,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Lest if by some great chance or miracle
13760,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Some wretch survives upon the ragged rocks,"
13761,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Who knowing not of human kind residing
13762,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"On this sequestered, unfrequented isle,"
13763,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Tired in contending with the angry billows
13764,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],And beaten by the surge the whole night through
13765,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"For want of such relief, may die ere morning--"
13766,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Perdition! three I see upon the rocks
13767,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Clinging, to keep off death, while the rude billow"
13768,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Swells o'er their heads, insultingly victorious:"
13769,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Now from the reef upborne I see them struggle,"
13770,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Heaven grant, successfully!--they labour on,"
13771,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Now headlong to the shore, now back they go"
13772,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Despairing to the main!--now, now they land"
13773,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Safe in that calm recess, a narrow bay"
13774,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],To them the heaven from impending ruin--
13775,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],So what are you?--

13779,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"If thou art an inhabitant of the isle,"
13780,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Lend your kind aid to three half perished wretches
13781,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Of threescore souls, the only three remaining--"
13782,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],And if thou knowest of any sheltered spot
13783,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Where from these horrid blasts and water spouts
13784,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],We may retire to pass the long dull night:
13785,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Or if thou knowest of any standing pool
13786,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Or running stream, or earth-supported spring,"
13787,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"O tell us! and, as nothing more remains,"
13788,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Our gratitude must be thy sole reward.

13792,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Among the hills, on their declivities"
13793,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Full many a sylvan haunt I have espied
13794,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Ere now, in wandering when the heaven was bright;"
13795,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],But springs or running streams abound not here
13796,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],The skies alone supply the hollowed rock
13797,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],From whence I drain my annual full supply:
13798,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Yet to my cavern you shall all resort
13799,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],To taste a hermit's hospitality--
13800,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"If you have strength, ascend this winding path"
13801,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And amongst these rugged rocks, still following me,"
13802,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"We soon shall reach a safe retreat, removed"

13809,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"With mingling branches, form a blest abode;"
13810,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Here, bleating lambs crowd to the evening fold"
13811,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And goats and kids, that wander o'er the hills,"
13812,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Vext by the storm, herd to the social hermit;"
13813,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"In neighbouring groves the juicy lemon swells,"
13814,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"The golden orange charms the admiring eye,"
13815,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],And the rich cocoa yields her milky stream.

13821,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],To wake the friendly blaze.--To drain the dams
13822,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Of these impatient kids, be next my care:"
13823,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"The cocoa's milky flesh, dried pulse and roots"

13825,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Dispells the gloom, and this tornado ceases,"

13827,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"The bodies of your dear and lost companions,"
13828,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"That so we may commit them to the dust,"
13829,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],And thus obliterate from our remembrance
13830,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],The horrid havock that this storm occasioned.

13843,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],What chance or fortune brought you to these shores:
13844,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Whether alone on these rough craggs you dwell
13845,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Where wandering mist is gathered into showers,"
13846,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Or whether town or village decks the plain;
13847,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Or is there sheltered port, where swelling sails"
13848,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Lodge lofty ships, from hurricanes secure,"
13849,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Fenced in by reefs, or locked by neighbouring hills."

13888,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"That object I have here which they pursue,"
13889,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Grasping it, miser-like, in my embraces--"
13890,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"The stream distilling from the shaded cliff,"
13891,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And fruits mature from trees by Nature planted,"

13896,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"My herd of goats is wandering in the wild,"

13904,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Is he some savage offspring of the isle,"
13905,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"The mountain goat his food, his god the sun;"
13906,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Some wretch produced from mingled heat and moisture.

13917,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And then he seemed so pleased and satisfied,"

13924,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"A bed of moss, a cap, an earthen jug,"
13925,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"And some few goat skins, furnish out his cave:"
13926,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],But still this humble guise of poverty
13927,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],Vast sums of splendid riches may conceal:
13928,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],The flooring of his den is a loose sand--
13929,THE HERMIT OF SABA[362],"Searching a fathom deep may shew strange things,"

14624,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"In vain their story we recall,"
14625,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"The rise of empires, or the fall;"
14626,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Our modern men, a busy crew,"
14627,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Must, in their turn, have something new."
14628,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],By moralists we have been told

14668,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],Of every ill with which we're curs'd
14669,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],This want of money is the worst:
14670,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"This was the curse that fell on Cain,"
14671,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],The vengeance for a brother slain:
14672,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"For this he quit his native sod,"
14673,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Retreated to the land of Nod,"
14674,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"And, in the torture of despair,"
14675,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Turn'd poet, pimp, or newsman there--"
14676,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],Divines have labour'd in the dark
14677,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],To find the meaning of his mark:
14678,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],How many idle things they wrote--
14679,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],'Twas nothing but a ragged coat.

14688,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Seasons advance, and moons decay,"
14689,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"And life itself make haste away,"
14690,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],And news-men only vex their brains

14692,A NEWSMAN'S ADDRESS[374],"Such usage I may find, 'tis true,"

14922,VIRG. ECLOG.,"Some rustic soon, with fierce attack,"

15514,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Happy the man who plans, by force of steam"
15515,TO MEMMIUS[392],To drive his boat twelve knots against the stream;
15516,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Still happier he, who, born to build a bridge,"
15517,TO MEMMIUS[392],Schemes mighty matters on some river's edge:--
15518,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Such to the world the noblest light impart,"
15519,TO MEMMIUS[392],"The first in genius, and the first in art!"
15520,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Hence, then, ye bards, from our wise court refrain;"
15521,TO MEMMIUS[392],Wiseacres have forestall'd the present reign:
15522,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""No empty scribblings we endure at court"""
15523,TO MEMMIUS[392],"(Cries Publius, poring o'er a dull Report;)"
15524,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Nothing but useful projects we require,"
15525,TO MEMMIUS[392],"(Cries a new-fangled, self-important 'squire)"
15526,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Even Churchman, with his chart, will just but do,"
15527,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Who to the pole will now all art pursue:"
15528,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""For foreign courts have fail'd our men of song,"
15529,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""And trust me, bards, the Muses went along;"
15530,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Since that bright morn they stept on board their brig,"
15531,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""No Muses here--no Muses are with pig;"
15532,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Nor 'till their barque shall heave in sight, once more,"
15533,TO MEMMIUS[392],"""Shall one true Muse grow pregnant on this shore!"""
15534,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Now, had not wayward Fortune fix'd me fast,"
15535,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Firm to a point, that never shall be pass'd;"
15536,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Did I the smiles of Fortune still pursue,"
15537,TO MEMMIUS[392],"And, Memmius, wish to rise in fame, like you,"
15538,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Were this my scheme, I'd quit at once the sail,"
15539,TO MEMMIUS[392],"And haste to court with compasses and scale,"
15540,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Quit all the hopes the finer arts bestow,"
15541,TO MEMMIUS[392],"The flowers of fancy, and--no fruits that grow;"
15542,TO MEMMIUS[392],Indulge that powerful something in the scull
15543,TO MEMMIUS[392],"That makes us wealthy while it keeps us dull,"
15544,TO MEMMIUS[392],"To the best place ensures a certain claim,"
15545,TO MEMMIUS[392],"The road to fortune, and the road to fame."

15549,TO MEMMIUS[392],"edition. The reference to steamboats alludes to Fitch, who at that time"
15550,TO MEMMIUS[392],was experimenting with steam navigation. In 1790 he completed his fourth

15552,TO MEMMIUS[392],"Burlington, at the rate of eight miles per hour."
