28,PREFACE,
29,PREFACE,The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's
30,PREFACE,poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
31,PREFACE,artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
32,PREFACE,qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
33,PREFACE,"themes,--life and love and death. That ""irresistible needle-touch,"""
34,PREFACE,"as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very"
35,PREFACE,"core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as"
36,PREFACE,it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
37,PREFACE,"power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to"
38,PREFACE,"form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties."
39,PREFACE,
40,PREFACE,Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending
41,PREFACE,"occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of"
42,PREFACE,"her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend ""H.H."""
43,PREFACE,"must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th"
44,PREFACE,"September, 1884, she wrote:--"
45,PREFACE,
46,PREFACE,
47,PREFACE,"MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses"
48,PREFACE,"you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your ""day and"
49,PREFACE,"generation"" that you will not give them light."
50,PREFACE,
51,PREFACE,If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive
52,PREFACE,"you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee"
53,PREFACE,and executor. Surely after you are what is called
54,PREFACE,"""dead"" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you"
55,PREFACE,have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
56,PREFACE,"verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think"
57,PREFACE,we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
58,PREFACE,a thought any more than a deed which might help a
59,PREFACE,single soul. . . .

64,HELEN JACKSON.,
65,HELEN JACKSON.,
66,HELEN JACKSON.,"The ""portfolios"" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,"
67,HELEN JACKSON.,by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had
68,HELEN JACKSON.,"been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little"
69,HELEN JACKSON.,"fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear"
70,HELEN JACKSON.,"evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had"
71,HELEN JACKSON.,received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of
72,HELEN JACKSON.,"rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and"
73,HELEN JACKSON.,"phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one"
74,HELEN JACKSON.,"form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without"
75,HELEN JACKSON.,"important exception, her friends have generously placed at the"
76,HELEN JACKSON.,disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and
77,HELEN JACKSON.,these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
78,HELEN JACKSON.,renderings of the same verse.
79,HELEN JACKSON.,
80,HELEN JACKSON.,To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
81,HELEN JACKSON.,"subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They"
82,HELEN JACKSON.,should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
83,HELEN JACKSON.,"suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some"
84,HELEN JACKSON.,time in the finished picture.
85,HELEN JACKSON.,
86,HELEN JACKSON.,Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
87,HELEN JACKSON.,winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the
88,HELEN JACKSON.,"April following, she says, ""I made no verse, but one or two, until"
89,HELEN JACKSON.,"this winter."""
90,HELEN JACKSON.,
91,HELEN JACKSON.,"The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running"
92,HELEN JACKSON.,Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in
93,HELEN JACKSON.,"breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her"
94,HELEN JACKSON.,latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
95,HELEN JACKSON.,"fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,"
96,HELEN JACKSON.,"everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous"
97,HELEN JACKSON.,dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of
98,HELEN JACKSON.,a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
99,HELEN JACKSON.,strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of
100,HELEN JACKSON.,"the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,"
101,HELEN JACKSON.,the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
102,HELEN JACKSON.,chronologic accuracy.
103,HELEN JACKSON.,
104,HELEN JACKSON.,"As a rule, the verses were without titles; but ""A Country Burial,"""
105,HELEN JACKSON.,"""A Thunder-Storm,"" ""The Humming-Bird,"" and a few others were named"
106,HELEN JACKSON.,"by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the"
107,HELEN JACKSON.,"accompanying note, if sent to a friend."
108,HELEN JACKSON.,
109,HELEN JACKSON.,"The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in"
110,HELEN JACKSON.,"pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of"
111,HELEN JACKSON.,responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not
112,HELEN JACKSON.,absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her
113,HELEN JACKSON.,"rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it"
114,HELEN JACKSON.,seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
115,HELEN JACKSON.,more usual rhymes.
116,HELEN JACKSON.,
117,HELEN JACKSON.,"Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very"
118,HELEN JACKSON.,absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
119,HELEN JACKSON.,"Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a"
120,HELEN JACKSON.,particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
121,HELEN JACKSON.,virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of
122,HELEN JACKSON.,"inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and"
123,HELEN JACKSON.,"the ""thought-rhyme"" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an"
124,HELEN JACKSON.,unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.
125,HELEN JACKSON.,
126,HELEN JACKSON.,Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.
127,HELEN JACKSON.,"Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the"
128,HELEN JACKSON.,"sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She"
129,HELEN JACKSON.,"touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost"
130,HELEN JACKSON.,"humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is"
131,HELEN JACKSON.,"never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic"
132,HELEN JACKSON.,"has said, she may exhibit toward God ""an Emersonian self-possession,"""
133,HELEN JACKSON.,it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
134,HELEN JACKSON.,as it is rare.
135,HELEN JACKSON.,
136,HELEN JACKSON.,"She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She"
137,HELEN JACKSON.,"was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no"
138,HELEN JACKSON.,love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
139,HELEN JACKSON.,"introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist"
140,HELEN JACKSON.,in pretence.
141,HELEN JACKSON.,
142,HELEN JACKSON.,"Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and"
143,HELEN JACKSON.,"bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted"
144,HELEN JACKSON.,"human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the"
145,HELEN JACKSON.,first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
146,HELEN JACKSON.,"pope; the first red leaf hurrying through ""the altered air,"" an"
147,HELEN JACKSON.,epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or
148,HELEN JACKSON.,"melancholy, she lived in its presence."
