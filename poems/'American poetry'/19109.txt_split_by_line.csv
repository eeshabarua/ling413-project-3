1230,VI.,
1231,VI.,At neither ghost nor ghoul aghast

1235,VI.,"Are sweeter than of kindred dear,"
1236,VI.,Sweeter than Florimel's.
1237,VI.,
1238,VI.,He delves through centuries of dust
1239,VI.,"To resurrect some unknown bust,"
1240,VI.,"A torso, or a goddess whole;"
1241,VI.,"Maybe like Venus, minus arms--"
1242,VI.,Haply to find those missing charms;
1243,VI.,"But not the lost, lost soul."
1244,VI.,
1245,VI.,He dotes on aborigines
1246,VI.,"Who lived in caves and hollow trees,"
1247,VI.,And barters for their trinkets rare;
1248,VI.,Exchanging with those dusky breeds
1249,VI.,For arrow-heads and shells and beads
1250,VI.,A scalplock of his hair.
1251,VI.,
1252,VI.,Had he been born--thus he laments--
1253,VI.,"Along with other great events,"

2306,VI.,
2307,VI.,"Alas, we only hate the weed!"

2328,VI.,Such potency can ever hold
2329,VI.,As that which lovingly controlled
2330,VI.,My spirit long ago.
2331,VI.,
2332,VI.,How oft my burning cheek as if
2333,VI.,"By Zephyrus was fanned,"
2334,VI.,And nothing interdicted pain
2335,VI.,Or seemed to make me well again

2373,VI.,The acme of all fine dessert;
2374,VI.,"So, singling out the very least"

2396,VI.,A sad discoloration showed
2397,VI.,Where orange-juice--it was a sin!--
2398,VI.,A polka-dot had painted in;
2399,VI.,Which moved the roguish girl to say
2400,VI.,Half-ruefully (half-_décolleté_)--
2401,VI.,"""I'm glad it's Leap Year now, for I--"""
2402,VI.,Her voice was like a moistened lute

2414,VI.,"Who, thereby lifted some degrees"
2415,VI.,"Above less-favored devotees,"
2416,VI.,With rainbow sails began to trim
2417,VI.,His craft of sweet felicity;
2418,VI.,So mirth in reckless afterlude
2419,VI.,"Convulsed the merry multitude,"
2420,VI.,"Who laughed at Archie's self-esteem,"
2421,VI.,And pitied Will's long-cherished dream;
2422,VI.,"While all declared, for her and Ned--"
2423,VI.,His face was like a silver tray--

2823,VI.,Where hope in ashes lies--
2824,VI.,"A tower beautiful to stand,"
2825,VI.,Her monument whose gentle hand
2826,VI.,And presence in the skies
2827,VI.,Make home of Paradise.
2828,VI.,
2829,VI.,In wintry bleakness nature glows
2830,VI.,Beneath the stellar ray;
2831,VI.,"We see the mold, but not the rose,"
2832,VI.,And meditate if knowledge goes
2833,VI.,"Into yon mound of clay,"
2834,VI.,With her who passed away.
2835,VI.,
2836,VI.,"Of sighs, and tears, and joys denied"
2837,VI.,Do echoes reach up there?
2838,VI.,Do seraphs know--God does--how wide
2839,VI.,And deep is sorrow's bitter tide
2840,VI.,"Of dolor and despair,"
2841,VI.,And darkness everywhere?
2842,VI.,
2843,VI.,"Dear angel, snatched from our caress,"
2844,VI.,"So suddenly withdrawn,"
2845,VI.,Alone are we and comfortless;
2846,VI.,As in a dome of emptiness
2847,VI.,"The old routine goes on,"
2848,VI.,"Aimless, since thou art gone."
2849,VI.,
2850,VI.,"Oh, dearer unto us than aught"
2851,VI.,In all the world beside
2852,VI.,Of thee to cherish blessed thought;
2853,VI.,"So early thy sweet mission wrought,"
2854,VI.,"As friend, as promised bride,"
2855,VI.,"Who lived, and loved, and died."
2856,VI.,
2857,VI.,
2858,VI.,
2859,VI.,
2860,VI.,Thanksgiving.
2861,VI.,
2862,VI.,
2863,VI.,"Nature, erewhile so marvelously lovely, is bereft"
2864,VI.,Of her supernal charm;
2865,VI.,"And with the few dead garlands of departed splendor left,"
2866,VI.,"Like crape upon her arm,"
2867,VI.,"In boreal hints, and sudden gusts"
2868,VI.,"That fan the glowing ember,"
2869,VI.,By multitude of ways fulfills
2870,VI.,The promise of November.
2871,VI.,
2872,VI.,"Upon the path where Beauty, sylvan priestess, sped away,"
2873,VI.,Lies the rich afterglow
2874,VI.,"Of Indian Summer, bringing round the happy holiday"
2875,VI.,That antedates the snow:
2876,VI.,"The glad Thanksgiving time, the cheer,"
2877,VI.,The festival commotion
2878,VI.,That stirs fraternal feeling from
2879,VI.,The mountains to the ocean.
2880,VI.,
2881,VI.,O Hospitality! unclose thy bounty-laden hand
2882,VI.,"In generous dealing, where"
2883,VI.,"Is gathered in reunion each long-severed household band,"
2884,VI.,And let no vacant chair
2885,VI.,"Show where the strongest, brightest link"
2886,VI.,In love's dear chain is broken--
2887,VI.,A symbol more pathetic than
2888,VI.,By language ever spoken.
2889,VI.,
2890,VI.,Into the place held sacred to the memory of some
2891,VI.,"Beloved absentee,"
2892,VI.,"Perchance passed to the other shore, oh, let the stranger come"
2893,VI.,And in gratuity
2894,VI.,Partake of festal favors that
2895,VI.,"Shall sweeten hours of labor,"
2896,VI.,And strengthen amity and love
2897,VI.,Unto his friend and neighbor.
2898,VI.,
2899,VI.,"Let gratitude's pure incense in warm orisons ascend,"
2900,VI.,"A blessing to secure,"
2901,VI.,And gracious impulse bearing largesse of good gifts extend
2902,VI.,To all deserving poor;
2903,VI.,So may the day be hallowed by
2904,VI.,"Unstinted thanks and giving,"
2905,VI.,In sweet remembrance of the dead
2906,VI.,And kindness to the living.
2907,VI.,
2908,VI.,
2909,VI.,
2910,VI.,
2911,VI.,Receiving Sight.
2912,VI.,
2913,VI.,
2914,VI.,In hours of meditation fraught
2915,VI.,"With mem'ries of departed days,"
2916,VI.,"Comes oft a tender, loving thought"
2917,VI.,Of one who shared our youthful plays.
2918,VI.,
2919,VI.,In gayest sports and pleasures rife
2920,VI.,"Whose happy nature reveled so,"
2921,VI.,"That on her ardent, joyous life"
2922,VI.,"A shadow lay, we did not know;"
2923,VI.,
2924,VI.,And bade her look one summer night
2925,VI.,"Up to the sky that seemed to hold,"
2926,VI.,"In dying sunset splendor bright,"
2927,VI.,"All hues of sapphire, red, and gold."
2928,VI.,
2929,VI.,How strange the spell that mystified
2930,VI.,"Us all, and hushed our wonted glee,"
2931,VI.,"As sadly her sweet voice replied,"
2932,VI.,"""Why, don't you know I cannot see?"""
2933,VI.,
2934,VI.,Too true! those eyes bereft of sight
2935,VI.,"No blemish bare, no drop-serene,"
2936,VI.,But nothing in this world of light
2937,VI.,And beauty they had ever seen.
2938,VI.,
2939,VI.,
2940,VI.,A dozen years in gentle ruth
2941,VI.,"Their impress lent to brow and cheek,"
2942,VI.,When precious words of sacred truth
2943,VI.,Led her the Saviour's face to seek.
2944,VI.,
2945,VI.,Responsive unto earnest prayers
2946,VI.,"Commingling love and penitence,"
2947,VI.,A blessing came--not unawares--
2948,VI.,In new and strange experience.
2949,VI.,
2950,VI.,"And all was light, as Faith's clear eye"
2951,VI.,A brighter world than ours divined;
2952,VI.,For never clouds obscured the sky
2953,VI.,"That she could see, while _we_ were blind."
2954,VI.,
2955,VI.,"Oh, it must be an awful thing"
2956,VI.,To be shut out from light of day!--
2957,VI.,"From summer's grace, and bloom of spring"
2958,VI.,In gladness words cannot portray.
2959,VI.,
2960,VI.,But haply into every heart
2961,VI.,May enter that Celestial Light
2962,VI.,That doth to life's dark ways impart
2963,VI.,A radiance hid from mortal sight.
2964,VI.,
2965,VI.,
2966,VI.,
2967,VI.,
2968,VI.,Revenge.
2969,VI.,
2970,VI.,
2971,VI.,"Beside my window day and night,"
2972,VI.,"Its tendrils reaching left and right,"
2973,VI.,A morning glory grew;
2974,VI.,"With blossoms covered, pink and white"
2975,VI.,"And deep, delicious blue."
2976,VI.,
2977,VI.,"Its care became my daily thought,"
2978,VI.,Who to the sweet diversion brought
2979,VI.,A bit of florist skill
2980,VI.,"To guide its progress, till it caught"
2981,VI.,The meaning of my will.
2982,VI.,
2983,VI.,When through the trellis in and out
2984,VI.,It bent and turned and climbed about
2985,VI.,"And so ambitious grew,"
2986,VI.,O'erleaped a chasm beyond the spout
2987,VI.,"Where raindrops trickled through,"
2988,VI.,
2989,VI.,"Then, in caressing, graceful way,"
2990,VI.,Around a door knob twined one day
2991,VI.,With modest show of pride;
2992,VI.,All unaware that danger lay
2993,VI.,Just on the other side.
2994,VI.,
2995,VI.,"An awkward, verdant ""maid of work,"""
2996,VI.,"Who dearly loved her tasks to shirk,"
2997,VI.,While rummaging among
2998,VI.,"Unused apartments, with a jerk"
2999,VI.,The door wide open flung.
3000,VI.,
3001,VI.,"And lo! there lay, uprooted quite,"
3002,VI.,The object of my heart's delight--
3003,VI.,"I did not weep or rant,"
3004,VI.,And yet a grain or two of spite
3005,VI.,My secret thoughts would haunt.
3006,VI.,
3007,VI.,So when at night her favorite beau
3008,VI.,Beside his charmer sat below--
3009,VI.,"That is, _dans le cuisine_--"
3010,VI.,"Occurred, as all the neighbors know,"
3011,VI.,A semi-tragic scene.
3012,VI.,
3013,VI.,"The garden hose, obscured from view,"
3014,VI.,Turned on itself and drenched the two--
3015,VI.,A hapless circumstance
3016,VI.,"That lengthened out her ""frizzes"" new,"
3017,VI.,But shrunk his Sunday pants.
3018,VI.,
3019,VI.,Remember this was years agone--
3020,VI.,The madcap now hath sober grown
3021,VI.,"And hose is better wrought,"
3022,VI.,And neither now would run alone
3023,VI.,The risk of being caught.
3024,VI.,
3025,VI.,
3026,VI.,
3027,VI.,
3028,VI.,On the Common.
3029,VI.,
3030,VI.,
3031,VI.,"We met on ""Boston Common""--"
3032,VI.,Of course it was by chance--
3033,VI.,"A sudden, unexpected,"
3034,VI.,But happy circumstance
3035,VI.,That gave the dull October day
3036,VI.,"A beautiful, refulgent ray."
3037,VI.,
3038,VI.,Like wandering refugees from
3039,VI.,"A city of renown,"
3040,VI.,Impelled to reconnoiter
3041,VI.,"This Massachusetts town,"
3042,VI.,"Each by a common object urged,"
3043,VI.,Upon the park our paths converged.
3044,VI.,
3045,VI.,"Good nature, bubbling over"
3046,VI.,"In healthy, hearty laughs,"
3047,VI.,And little lavish speeches
3048,VI.,"Like pleasant paragraphs,"
3049,VI.,"The kind regard, unstudied joke,"
3050,VI.,His true felicity bespoke.
3051,VI.,
3052,VI.,A bit of doleful knowledge
3053,VI.,"Confided unto me,"
3054,VI.,About the way the doctors--
3055,VI.,Who never could agree--
3056,VI.,"His knees had tortured, softly drew"
3057,VI.,"My sympathy and humor, too."
3058,VI.,
3059,VI.,"I hoped he wouldn't lose them,"
3060,VI.,And languish in the dumps
3061,VI.,By having to quadrille on
3062,VI.,A pair of polished stumps--
3063,VI.,"But a corky limb, though one might dread,"
3064,VI.,Isn't half as bad as a wooden head.
3065,VI.,
3066,VI.,He censured those empirics
3067,VI.,"Who never heal an ill,"
3068,VI.,Though bound by their diplomas
3069,VI.,"To either cure or kill,"
3070,VI.,"Who should, with ignominy crowned,"
3071,VI.,Their patients follow--under ground.
3072,VI.,
3073,VI.,I left him at the foot of
3074,VI.,"""The Soldiers' Monument,"""
3075,VI.,With incoherent mutterings--
3076,VI.,As though 'twere his intent
3077,VI.,"To turn the sod, a rod or two,"
3078,VI.,"And sleep beside the ""boys in blue."""
3079,VI.,
3080,VI.,In Hartford's charming circles
3081,VI.,"His bonhommie I miss,"
3082,VI.,And having never seen him
3083,VI.,"From that day unto this,"
3084,VI.,I think of him with much regret
3085,VI.,As lying--with the soldiers--yet.
3086,VI.,
3087,VI.,
3088,VI.,
3089,VI.,
3090,VI.,Woman's Help.
3091,VI.,
3092,VI.,
3093,VI.,Sometimes I long to write an ode
3094,VI.,"And magnify his name,"
3095,VI.,"The man of honor, on the road"
3096,VI.,"To opulence and fame,"
3097,VI.,On whom was never aid bestowed
3098,VI.,By any helpful dame.
3099,VI.,
3100,VI.,To all the world I fain would show
3101,VI.,"That talent widely known,"
3102,VI.,"Rare eloquence, of burning glow"
3103,VI.,"To melt a heart of stone,"
3104,VI.,"That all his gifts, a dazzling row,"
3105,VI.,"Are his, and his alone."
3106,VI.,
3107,VI.,"But him, of character and mind"
3108,VI.,"Superb, alert, and strong,"
3109,VI.,I never study but to find
3110,VI.,"The subject of my song,"
3111,VI.,"Some paragon of womankind,"
3112,VI.,Has helped him all along.
3113,VI.,
3114,VI.,"He may not know, he may not guess,"
3115,VI.,"How much to her he owes,"
3116,VI.,How every scion of success
3117,VI.,"That in his nature grows,"
3118,VI.,"Developed by her watchfulness,"
3119,VI.,Becomes a blooming rose.
3120,VI.,
3121,VI.,"From buffetings in humble place,"
3122,VI.,"And labors ill begun,"
3123,VI.,To proud achievement in the race
3124,VI.,"And laurels grandly won,"
3125,VI.,His trials all she dares to face
3126,VI.,As friend and champion.
3127,VI.,
3128,VI.,The bars that hinder his advance
3129,VI.,"And half obscure the goal,"
3130,VI.,The stubborn bond of circumstance
3131,VI.,"That irritates his soul,"
3132,VI.,"The countershafts of arrogance,"
3133,VI.,All yield to her control.
3134,VI.,
3135,VI.,He builds a tower--she below
3136,VI.,Is handing up the bricks;
3137,VI.,His light is brilliant just as though
3138,VI.,Her hand had trimmed the wicks;
3139,VI.,He prays for daily bread--the dough
3140,VI.,A woman deigns to mix.
3141,VI.,
3142,VI.,
3143,VI.,
3144,VI.,
3145,VI.,Tobogganing.
3146,VI.,
3147,VI.,
3148,VI.,"Oh, the rare exhilaration,"
3149,VI.,"Oh, the novel delectation"
3150,VI.,Of a ride down the slide!
3151,VI.,"Packed like ice in zero weather,"
3152,VI.,"Pleasure-seekers close together,"
3153,VI.,"On a board as thin as wafer,"
3154,VI.,"Barely wider, scarcely safer,"
3155,VI.,At the height of recreation
3156,VI.,"Find a glorious inspiration,"
3157,VI.,Ere the speedy termination
3158,VI.,"In the snowy meadow wide,"
3159,VI.,Sloping to the river's side.
3160,VI.,
3161,VI.,"Oh, such quakers we begin it,"
3162,VI.,Timorous of the icy route!
3163,VI.,But to learn in half a minute
3164,VI.,"What felicity is in it,"
3165,VI.,"As we shoot down the chute,"
3166,VI.,"Smothered in toboggan suit,"
3167,VI.,"Redingote or roquelaure,"
3168,VI.,"Buttoned up (and down) before,"
3169,VI.,"Mittens, cap, and moccasin,"
3170,VI.,Just the garb to revel in;
3171,VI.,"So, the signal given, lo!"
3172,VI.,"Over solid ice and snow,"
3173,VI.,Down the narrow gauge we go
3174,VI.,"Swifter than a bird o'erhead,"
3175,VI.,Swifter than an arrow sped
3176,VI.,"From the staunchest, strongest bow."
3177,VI.,
3178,VI.,"Oh, it beats all ""Copenhagen,"""
3179,VI.,Silly lovers' paradise!
3180,VI.,"Like the frozen Androscoggin,"
3181,VI.,"Slippery, and smooth, and nice,"
3182,VI.,Is the track of the toboggan;
3183,VI.,"And there's nothing cheap about it,"
3184,VI.,"Everything is steep about it,"
3185,VI.,"The insolvent weep about it,"
3186,VI.,For the biggest thing on ice
3187,VI.,Is its tip-top price;
3188,VI.,"But were this three times the money,"
3189,VI.,Then the game were thrice as funny.
3190,VI.,
3191,VI.,Ye who dwell in latitudes
3192,VI.,"Where ""the blizzard"" ne'er intrudes,"
3193,VI.,And the water seldom freezes;
3194,VI.,"Ye of balmy Southern regions,"
3195,VI.,"Alabama's languid legions,"
3196,VI.,"From the ""hot blast"" of your breezes,"
3197,VI.,Where the verdure of the trees is
3198,VI.,"Limp, and loose, and pitiful,"
3199,VI.,Come up here where branches bare
3200,VI.,Stand like spikes in frosty air;
3201,VI.,Come up here where arctic rigor
3202,VI.,"Shall restore your bloom and vigor,"
3203,VI.,Making life enjoyable;
3204,VI.,Come and take a jog on
3205,VI.,The unparalleled toboggan!
3206,VI.,Such the zest that he who misses
3207,VI.,Never knows what perfect bliss is.
3208,VI.,"So the sport, the day's sensation,"
3209,VI.,Thrills and recreates creation.
3210,VI.,
3211,VI.,
3212,VI.,
3213,VI.,The Woods.
3214,VI.,
3215,VI.,
3216,VI.,I love the woods when the magic hand
3217,VI.,"Of Spring, as if sweeping the keys"
3218,VI.,"Of a wornout instrument, touches the earth;"
3219,VI.,When beauty and song in the gladness of birth
3220,VI.,"Awaken the heart of the desolate land,"
3221,VI.,And carol its rapture to every breeze.
3222,VI.,
3223,VI.,In summer's still solstice my steps are drawn
3224,VI.,To the shade of the forest trees;
3225,VI.,"To revel with Pan in his secret haunts,"
3226,VI.,"To pipe mazourkas while satyrs dance,"
3227,VI.,Or lull to soft slumber some favorite faun
3228,VI.,And fascinate strange wild birds and bees.
3229,VI.,
3230,VI.,I love the woods when autumnal fires
3231,VI.,Are kindled on every hill;
3232,VI.,"When dead leaves rustle in grove and field,"
3233,VI.,"And trees are known by the fruits they yield,"
3234,VI.,"And the wild grapes, sweetened by frost, inspire"
3235,VI.,"A mildly-desperate, bibulous thrill."
3236,VI.,
3237,VI.,There's a joy for which I would fling to the air
3238,VI.,"My petty portion of wealth and fame,"
3239,VI.,"In tracking the rabbit o'er fresh-fallen snow,"
3240,VI.,"The ways of the 'coon and opossum to know,"
3241,VI.,To capture squirrels when branches are bare
3242,VI.,As the cupboard shelf of that ancient dame.
3243,VI.,
3244,VI.,"Oh, I long to explore the woods again"
3245,VI.,"In my own aboriginal way,"
3246,VI.,As before I knew how culture could frown
3247,VI.,On a hoydenish gait and a homespun gown
3248,VI.,"Or dreamed that the strata of proud ""upper-ten"""
3249,VI.,Would smile at rusticity's _naïveté_.
3250,VI.,
3251,VI.,I sigh for the pleasures of long ago
3252,VI.,In youth's sweet halcyon time;
3253,VI.,When better beloved than the thoroughfare
3254,VI.,"By multitudes trod were the woodlands, where"
3255,VI.,"Was never a path that I did not know,"
3256,VI.,Nor thrifty sapling I dared not climb.
3257,VI.,
3258,VI.,Alas for lost freedom! Alas for me!
3259,VI.,"For oh, Society's lip would curl,"
3260,VI.,Propriety's self with scornful eye
3261,VI.,And gilt-edged Fashion would pass me by
3262,VI.,To know that sometimes I'm dying to be
3263,VI.,"The romp, the rover, the same old girl."
3264,VI.,
3265,VI.,
3266,VI.,
3267,VI.,
3268,VI.,Like Summer.
3269,VI.,
3270,VI.,
3271,VI.,November? 'tis a summer's day!
3272,VI.,For tropic airs are blowing
3273,VI.,As soft as whispered roundelay
3274,VI.,From unseen lips that seem to say
3275,VI.,To feathered songsters going
3276,VI.,"To sunnier, southern climes afar,"
3277,VI.,"""Stay where you are--stay where you are!"""
3278,VI.,
3279,VI.,And other tokens glad as these
3280,VI.,Declare that Summer lingers:
3281,VI.,"Round latent buds still hum the bees,"
3282,VI.,Slow fades the green from forest trees
3283,VI.,Ere Autumn's artist fingers
3284,VI.,"Have touched the landscape, and instead"
3285,VI.,"Brought out the amber, brown, and red."
3286,VI.,
3287,VI.,The invalid may yet enjoy
3288,VI.,"His favorite recreation,"
3289,VI.,"Gay, romping girl, unfettered boy"
3290,VI.,"In outdoor sports the time employ,"
3291,VI.,And happy consummation
3292,VI.,Of prudent plans the farmer know
3293,VI.,Ere wintry breezes round him blow.
3294,VI.,
3295,VI.,And they by poverty controlled--
3296,VI.,Good fortune shall betide them
3297,VI.,"As scenes of beauty they behold,"
3298,VI.,And seem to revel in the gold
3299,VI.,Which Plutus has denied them;
3300,VI.,"For, ah! the poor from want's despair"
3301,VI.,Oft covet wealth they never share.
3302,VI.,
3303,VI.,
3304,VI.,
3305,VI.,
3306,VI.,Sheridan's Last Ride.
3307,VI.,
3308,VI.,
3309,VI.,While Phoebus lent his hottest rays
3310,VI.,"To signalize midsummer days,"
3311,VI.,I stood in that far-famed enclosure
3312,VI.,"By thousands visited,"
3313,VI.,"Where, in the stillness of reposure,"
3314,VI.,Are grouped battalions dead.
3315,VI.,
3316,VI.,"Where, round each simple burial stone,"
3317,VI.,"The grass for decades twain has grown,"
3318,VI.,Protecting them in dreamless slumber
3319,VI.,"Who perished long ago,"
3320,VI.,"The multitudes defying number,"
3321,VI.,A part of war's tableau.
3322,VI.,
3323,VI.,Along the winding avenue
3324,VI.,A vast procession came in view;
3325,VI.,"The mourners' slow, advancing column"
3326,VI.,"With reverent step drew near,"
3327,VI.,"The ""Dead March"" playing, sad and solemn,"
3328,VI.,Above a soldier's bier.
3329,VI.,
3330,VI.,"There were the colonels, brigadiers,"
3331,VI.,"Comrades in arms of other years,"
3332,VI.,"Civilians, true and loyal-hearted"
3333,VI.,"To him their bravest man,"
3334,VI.,"Who seemed to say to those departed,"
3335,VI.,"""Make room for Sheridan!"""
3336,VI.,
3337,VI.,"Anon, beside the new-made mound,"
3338,VI.,"The warworn veterans gathered round,"
3339,VI.,"And spake of Lyon and of Lander,"
3340,VI.,"And others ranked as high,"
3341,VI.,"Recalling each his old commander,"
3342,VI.,One not afraid to die.
3343,VI.,
3344,VI.,"Thus, silent tenants one by one"
3345,VI.,Are crowding in at Arlington;
3346,VI.,"Thus Sheridan, the horseman daring,"
3347,VI.,Has joined the honored corps
3348,VI.,"Of those, their true insignia wearing,"
3349,VI.,Who battle nevermore.
3350,VI.,
3351,VI.,"Potomac's wave shall placid flow,"
3352,VI.,"And sing his requiem soft and low,"
3353,VI.,"His terrace grave be sweet with clover,"
3354,VI.,"And daisies star his bed,"
3355,VI.,For Sheridan's last ride is over--
3356,VI.,The General is dead!
3357,VI.,
3358,VI.,
3359,VI.,
3360,VI.,
3361,VI.,A Bit of Gladness.
3362,VI.,
3363,VI.,
3364,VI.,"As I near my lonely cottage,"
3365,VI.,"At the close of weary day,"
3366,VI.,There's a little bit of gladness
3367,VI.,Comes to meet me on the way:
3368,VI.,"Dimpled, tanned, and petticoated,"
3369,VI.,"Innocent as angels are,"
3370,VI.,"Like a smiling, straying sunbeam"
3371,VI.,Is my Stella--like a star.
3372,VI.,
3373,VI.,Soon a hand of tissue-softness
3374,VI.,"Slips confidingly in mine,"
3375,VI.,And with tender look appealing
3376,VI.,Eyes of beauty sweetly shine;
3377,VI.,Like a gentle shepherd guiding
3378,VI.,"Some lost lamb unto the fold,"
3379,VI.,"So she leads me homeward, prattling"
3380,VI.,Till her stories are all told.
3381,VI.,
3382,VI.,"""Papa, I'm so glad to see you--"
3383,VI.,Cousin Mabel came today--
3384,VI.,And the gas-man brought a letter
3385,VI.,That he said you'd better pay--
3386,VI.,"Yes, and _awful_ things is happened:"
3387,VI.,My poor kitty's drowned to death--
3388,VI.,"Mamma's got the 'Pigs in Clover'--"""
3389,VI.,Here she stops for want of breath.
3390,VI.,
3391,VI.,"I am like the bold knight-errant,"
3392,VI.,"From his castle who would roam,"
3393,VI.,"Trusting her, my faithful steward,"
3394,VI.,For a strict account of home;
3395,VI.,"And each day I toil, and hazard"
3396,VI.,"All that any man may dare,"
3397,VI.,"For a resting-place at even,"
3398,VI.,And the love that waits me there.
3399,VI.,
3400,VI.,And sometimes I look with pity
3401,VI.,On my neighbor's mansion tall:
3402,VI.,"There are chambers full of pictures,"
3403,VI.,"There are marbles in the hall,"
3404,VI.,Yet with all the signs of splendor
3405,VI.,"That may gild a pile of stone,"
3406,VI.,Not a living thing about it
3407,VI.,"But the owner, grim and lone."
3408,VI.,
3409,VI.,I believe that all his millions
3410,VI.,He would give without repine
3411,VI.,For a little bit of gladness
3412,VI.,"In his life, like that in mine;"
3413,VI.,This it is that makes my pathway
3414,VI.,"Beautiful, wherever trod,"
3415,VI.,"Keeps my soul from wreck and ruin,"
3416,VI.,Keeps me nearer to my God.

3420,VI.,
3421,VI.,The Charity Ball.
3422,VI.,
3423,VI.,
3424,VI.,"There was many a token of festal display,"
3425,VI.,"And reveling crowds who were never so gay,"
3426,VI.,"And, as it were Æolus charming the hours,"
3427,VI.,An orchestra hidden by foliage and flowers;
3428,VI.,"There were tapestries fit for the home of a queen,"
3429,VI.,And mirrors that glistened in wonderful sheen;
3430,VI.,"There was feasting and mirth in the banqueting-hall,"
3431,VI.,For this was the annual Charity Ball.
3432,VI.,
3433,VI.,"There were pompous civilians, in wealth who abide,"
3434,VI.,"Displaying their purses, the source of their pride;"
3435,VI.,"And plethoric dealers in margins and stocks,"
3436,VI.,"And owners of acres of elegant blocks,"
3437,VI.,And tenement-landlords who cling to a cent
3438,VI.,When from the poor widow exacting her rent--
3439,VI.,"Immovable, stern, as an adamant wall--"
3440,VI.,"And yet, who ""came down"" to this Charity Ball."
3441,VI.,
3442,VI.,"There was Beauty whose toilet, superb and unique,"
3443,VI.,Cost underpaid industry many a week
3444,VI.,"Of arduous labor of eye, and heartache,"
3445,VI.,Its starving inadequate pittance to make;
3446,VI.,"There were mischievous maidens and cavaliers bold,"
3447,VI.,Whose blushes and glances and coquetry told
3448,VI.,A tale of the monarch who held them in thrall--
3449,VI.,"Who met, as by chance, at the Charity Ball."
3450,VI.,
3451,VI.,"There were delicate viands the poor never taste,"
3452,VI.,And dollars were lavished in prodigal waste
3453,VI.,To pamper the palate of epicures rich;
3454,VI.,Who drew from the wine cellar's cavernous niche
3455,VI.,"""Excelsior"" brands of the rarest champagnes"
3456,VI.,To loosen their tongues--though it pilfered their brains--
3457,VI.,"Oh, sad if a step in some woeful downfall"
3458,VI.,Should ever be traced to a Charity Ball!
3459,VI.,
3460,VI.,"Outside of the window, pressed close to the pane,"
3461,VI.,"And furrowed by tears that had fallen like rain,"
3462,VI.,"Was the face of a woman, so spectral in hue,"
3463,VI.,"With great liquid eyes, like twin oceans of blue,"
3464,VI.,And cheeks in whose hollows were written the lines
3465,VI.,"That pitiless hunger so often defines,"
3466,VI.,"Who muttered, as closer she gathered the shawl,"
3467,VI.,"""Oh, never for me is this Charity Ball!"""
3468,VI.,
3469,VI.,"From liveried hirelings who bade her begone,"
3470,VI.,"By uniformed minions compelled to move on,"
3471,VI.,Out into the street again driven to roam--
3472,VI.,"For friends she had none, neither fortune nor home;"
3473,VI.,While carnival-goers in morning's dull gray
3474,VI.,"As homeward returning, fatigued and _blasé_,"
3475,VI.,"A vision encountered their hearts to appall,"
3476,VI.,And banish all thought of the Charity Ball.
3477,VI.,
3478,VI.,"As if seeking warmth from the icy curb-stone,"
3479,VI.,"A form half-reclining, half-clad, and unknown."
3480,VI.,"Dead eyes looking up with a meaningless stare,"
3481,VI.,Lay close to the crowded and broad thoroughfare;
3482,VI.,A form so emaciate the spirit had fled--
3483,VI.,"But the pulpit and press and the public all said,"
3484,VI.,"As society's doings they sought to recall,"
3485,VI.,"That a ""brilliant success"" was the Charity Ball."

3491,VI.,
3492,VI.,[One of the notable features of Baltimore is the big bell that hangs in
3493,VI.,"the city hall tower, to strike the hour and sound the fire alarm. It is"
3494,VI.,"called ""Big Sam,"" and weighs 5,000 pounds]"
3495,VI.,
3496,VI.,
3497,VI.,A million feet above the ground
3498,VI.,"(For so it seemed in winding round),"
3499,VI.,"A million, and two more,"
3500,VI.,"The latter stiff and sore,"
3501,VI.,While perspiration formed a part
3502,VI.,"Of every reeking pore,"
3503,VI.,I viewed the city like a chart
3504,VI.,Spread out upon the floor.
3505,VI.,
3506,VI.,"And said: ""Great guide Jehoiakin,"
3507,VI.,To me is meagre pleasure in
3508,VI.,"The height of spires and domes,"
3509,VI.,Of walls like ancient Rome's;
3510,VI.,"Nor care I for the marts of trade,"
3511,VI.,"Or shelves of musty tomes,"
3512,VI.,Nor yet for yonder colonnade
3513,VI.,Before your palace homes;
3514,VI.,
3515,VI.,"""But curiosity is keen"
3516,VI.,"To know the city's reigning queen,"
3517,VI.,Who suiteth well the score
3518,VI.,Of suitors at her door;
3519,VI.,"Oh, which of your divinities"
3520,VI.,Is she whom all adore?
3521,VI.,"Embodiment of truth, _who is_"
3522,VI.,"The belle of Baltimore?"""
3523,VI.,
3524,VI.,Veracity's revolving eyes

3539,VI.,"'Twas drawing near the holiday,"
3540,VI.,When piety and pity met
3541,VI.,"In whisp'ring council, and agreed"
3542,VI.,"That Christmas time, in homes of need,"
3543,VI.,Should be remembered in a way
3544,VI.,They never could forget.
3545,VI.,
3546,VI.,
3547,VI.,Then noble generosity
3548,VI.,"Took youth and goodness by the hand,"
3549,VI.,And planned a thousand charming ways
3550,VI.,"To celebrate this best of days,"
3551,VI.,While hearts were held in sympathy
3552,VI.,By love's encircling band.
3553,VI.,
3554,VI.,"So multitudes together came,"
3555,VI.,Like wandering magi from the East
3556,VI.,"With precious gifts unto the King,"
3557,VI.,With every good and perfect thing
3558,VI.,To satisfy a shivering frame
3559,VI.,Or amplify a feast.
3560,VI.,
3561,VI.,The angels had looked long and far
3562,VI.,"The happy scene to parallel,"
3563,VI.,When through the sanctuary door
3564,VI.,"Were carried gifts from shop and store,"
3565,VI.,"The treasures of the rich bazaar,"
3566,VI.,To give--but not to sell.
3567,VI.,
3568,VI.,As once the apostolic twelve
3569,VI.,"Of goods allotment made,"
3570,VI.,So equity dealt out with care
3571,VI.,"The widow's and the orphan's share,"
3572,VI.,And of the aged forced to delve
3573,VI.,At drudging task or trade.
3574,VI.,
3575,VI.,"Oh, could the joy which tears express"
3576,VI.,That out of gladness come
3577,VI.,"Be mirrored in its tender glow,"
3578,VI.,Before the beautiful tableau
3579,VI.,Ingratitude and selfishness
3580,VI.,Would shrink abashed and dumb!
3581,VI.,
3582,VI.,If every year and everywhere
3583,VI.,Could kindness thus expand
3584,VI.,"In bounteous gratuity,"
3585,VI.,To all her children earth would be

3597,VI.,"Prosperity abounded,"
3598,VI.,And ceaseless hum of industry
3599,VI.,In lines of friendly rivalry
3600,VI.,From day to day resounded.
3601,VI.,
3602,VI.,"Its shaded avenues were wide,"
3603,VI.,And closely bordered either side
3604,VI.,"With cottages or mansions,"
3605,VI.,Or marked by blocks of masonry
3606,VI.,That might defy a century
3607,VI.,To loosen from their stanchions.
3608,VI.,
3609,VI.,Its peaceful dwellers daily vied
3610,VI.,"To make this spot, with anxious pride,"
3611,VI.,"A Paradise of beauty,"
3612,VI.,"Recounted its attractions o'er,"
3613,VI.,And its adornment held no more
3614,VI.,A pleasure than a duty.
3615,VI.,
3616,VI.,"But, ere the daylight passed away,"
3617,VI.,"That hamlet fair in ruins lay,"
3618,VI.,Its hapless people scattered
3619,VI.,"Like playthings, at the cyclone's will,"
3620,VI.,And scarce remained one domicile
3621,VI.,Its fury had not shattered.
3622,VI.,
3623,VI.,Few moments of the tempest's wrath
3624,VI.,Sufficed to mark one dreadful path

3627,VI.,Rose shrieks of dying agony
3628,VI.,Above the desolation.

3637,VI.,Alas for aching hearts that wait
3638,VI.,Today in homes made desolate
3639,VI.,By one sharp blow appalling--

3686,VI.,
3687,VI.,"Oh, be not anxious; trouble grows"
3688,VI.,When cherished like a secret grief;
3689,VI.,It is the worm within the rose

3851,VI.,"There was a time in happy days gone by,"
3852,VI.,"That rosy interval of youth, when I"
3853,VI.,The scholar ardent early learned to trace
3854,VI.,Great tributaries to their starting place;
3855,VI.,And thine some prairie hollow obsolete
3856,VI.,Whose name how few remember or repeat.
3857,VI.,
3858,VI.,"Like thee, meandering, yet wafted back"
3859,VI.,"From distant hearth and lonely bivouac,"
3860,VI.,"From strange vicissitudes in other lands,"
3861,VI.,From half-wrought labors and unfinished plans
3862,VI.,"I come, in thy cool depths my brow to lave,"
3863,VI.,And rest a moment by thy silver wave.
3864,VI.,
3865,VI.,"But, ah! what means thy muddy, muggy hue?"
3866,VI.,I thought thee limpid as yon ether blue;
3867,VI.,I thought an angel's wing might dip below
3868,VI.,Thy sparkling surface and be white as snow;
3869,VI.,And of thy current I had dared to drink
3870,VI.,If not as one imbibing draughts of ink.
3871,VI.,
3872,VI.,Has some rough element of horrid clay
3873,VI.,"That spoils the earth like lava beds, they say,"
3874,VI.,"Come sliding down, as avalanches do,"
3875,VI.,And thy fair bosom percolated through?
3876,VI.,Or some apothecary's compound vile
3877,VI.,Polluted thee so many a murky mile?
3878,VI.,
3879,VI.,"Why not, proud State, beneficence insure,"
3880,VI.,Selling thy soil or giving to the poor?
3881,VI.,"For sad it is that dust of Illinois,"
3882,VI.,"With coal and compost its conjoint alloy,"
3883,VI.,"A morceau washed from Mississippi's mouth,"
3884,VI.,Should build up acres for our neighbors south.
3885,VI.,
3886,VI.,"River! I grieve, but not for loss of dirt--"
3887,VI.,"Once stainless, just because of what thou wert."
3888,VI.,Thus on thy banks I linger and reflect
3889,VI.,"That, surely as all waterways connect,"
3890,VI.,"Forever flowing onward to the sea,"
3891,VI.,Shall the great billow thy redemption be.
3892,VI.,
3893,VI.,"And now, dear Sangamon, farewell! I wait"
3894,VI.,On that Elysian scene to meditate
3895,VI.,"When, separated from the dregs of earth,"
3896,VI.,"Life's stream shall sweeter be, of better worth;"
3897,VI.,"And, like the ocean with its restless tide,"
3898,VI.,By its own action cleansed and purified.

3904,VI.,

3906,VI.,"The smallest flower beside my path,"
3907,VI.,"In loveliness of bloom,"
3908,VI.,Some element of comfort hath
3909,VI.,To rid my heart of gloom;
3910,VI.,"But these, of spotless purity,"
3911,VI.,"And fragrant as the rose,"
3912,VI.,As sad a sight recall to me
3913,VI.,As time shall e'er disclose.
3914,VI.,
3915,VI.,"Oh, there are pictures on the brain"
3916,VI.,"Sometimes by shadows made,"
3917,VI.,"Till dust is blent with dust again,"
3918,VI.,"That never, never fade;"
3919,VI.,And things supremely bright and fair
3920,VI.,As ever known in life
3921,VI.,"Suggest the darkness of despair,"
3922,VI.,And sanguinary strife.
3923,VI.,
3924,VI.,I shut my eyes; 'tis all in vain--
3925,VI.,"The battle-field appears,"
3926,VI.,And one among the thousands slain
3927,VI.,In manhood's brilliant years;
3928,VI.,"An elbow pillowing his head,"
3929,VI.,And on the crimson sand
3930,VI.,"Syringa-blooms, distained and dead,"
3931,VI.,Within his rigid hand.
3932,VI.,
3933,VI.,"Could she foresee, who from the stem"

3944,VI.,When to our heroes' graves we bring
3945,VI.,"The blossom-wealth of May,"
3946,VI.,"While martial strains are soft and low,"
3947,VI.,"And music seems a prayer,"
3948,VI.,"Unto a hallowed spot I go,"
3949,VI.,And leave syringas there.

3955,VI.,
3956,VI.,
3957,VI.,"My careful plans all storm-subdued,"
3958,VI.,In disappointing solitude
3959,VI.,The weary hours began;
3960,VI.,"And scarce I deemed when time had sped,"
3961,VI.,Marked only by the passing tread
3962,VI.,Of some pedestrian.
3963,VI.,
3964,VI.,"But with the morrow's tranquil dawn,"
3965,VI.,A fairy scene I looked upon
3966,VI.,That filled me with delight;
3967,VI.,"Far-reaching from my own abode,"
3968,VI.,"The world in matchless splendor glowed,"
3969,VI.,Arrayed in spotless white.
3970,VI.,
3971,VI.,The surface of the hillside slope
3972,VI.,Gleamed in my farthest vision's scope
3973,VI.,Like opalescent stone;
3974,VI.,"Rich jewels hung on every tree,"
3975,VI.,Whose crystalline transparency
3976,VI.,Golconda's gems outshone.
3977,VI.,
3978,VI.,Beyond the line where wayside posts
3979,VI.,"Stood up, like fear-inspiring ghosts"
3980,VI.,"Of awful form and mien,"
3981,VI.,"A mansion tall, my neighbor's pride,"
3982,VI.,"A seeming castle fortified,"
3983,VI.,Uprose in wondrous sheen.
3984,VI.,
3985,VI.,The evergreens loomed up before
3986,VI.,"My staunch and storm-defying door,"
3987,VI.,Like snowy palaces
3988,VI.,That one dare only penetrate
3989,VI.,"With reverence--as at Heaven's gate,"
3990,VI.,Awed by its mysteries.
3991,VI.,
3992,VI.,The apple trees' extended arms
3993,VI.,Upheld a thousand varied charms;
3994,VI.,The curious tracery
3995,VI.,Of trellised grapevine seemed to me
3996,VI.,A rare network of filigree
3997,VI.,In silver drapery.
3998,VI.,
3999,VI.,And I no longer thought it hard
4000,VI.,"From favorite pursuits debarred,"
4001,VI.,Nor gazed with rueful face;
4002,VI.,For every object seemed to be
4003,VI.,Invested with the witchery
4004,VI.,Of magic art and grace.
4005,VI.,
4006,VI.,"And, though a multitude of cares,"
4007,VI.,"Perplexing, profitless affairs,"
4008,VI.,"Absorbed the hours, it seems"
4009,VI.,That on the golden steps of thought
4010,VI.,"I mounted heavenward, and wrought"
4011,VI.,Out many hopeful schemes.
4012,VI.,
4013,VI.,"Thus every day, though it may span"
4014,VI.,The gulf wherein some cherished plan
4015,VI.,"Lies disarranged and crossed,"
4016,VI.,"If, ere its close, we shall have trod"
4017,VI.,"The path that leads us nearer God,"
4018,VI.,Cannot be counted lost.

4027,VI.,Of sense and thrift and toil;
4028,VI.,Who reckons less on pedigree

4030,VI.,"And no ""blue blood""--if such there be--"
4031,VI.,His veins can ever spoil.
4032,VI.,
4033,VI.,And yet on blood his heart is set;
4034,VI.,"He has his sacred cow,"
4035,VI.,"Some Alderney or Jersey pet,"
4036,VI.,The mistress of the mow;
4037,VI.,His favorite pig is (by brevet)
4038,VI.,"""Lord Suffolk""--of the slough."
4039,VI.,
4040,VI.,To points of stock is he alive
4041,VI.,As keenest cattle king;
4042,VI.,"A thoroughbred he deigns to drive,"
4043,VI.,But not a mongrel thing;
4044,VI.,The very bees within his hive
4045,VI.,Are crossed--without a sting.
4046,VI.,
4047,VI.,If apple-boughs drop pumpkins and
4048,VI.,"Tomatoes grow on trees,"
4049,VI.,It is because his grafting hand
4050,VI.,Has so diverted these
4051,VI.,That alien shoots with native stand
4052,VI.,Like twin-born Siamese.
4053,VI.,
4054,VI.,"No neater farm a nabob owns,"
4055,VI.,"Its care his chief employ,"
4056,VI.,To find fertility in bones

4059,VI.,"A whistling, happy boy."
4060,VI.,
4061,VI.,The ancient plough and awkward flail
4062,VI.,He banished long ago;
4063,VI.,The zigzag fence with ponderous rail
4064,VI.,He dares to overthrow;
4065,VI.,"And wields, with sinews strong and hale,"
4066,VI.,The latest style of hoe.
4067,VI.,
4068,VI.,"The household, founded as it were"
4069,VI.,"Upon the Decalogue,"
4070,VI.,"He classes with the minister,"
4071,VI.,"The rural pedagogue,"
4072,VI.,And as a sort of angel-cur
4073,VI.,Regards his spotted dog.
4074,VI.,
4075,VI.,"His wife reviews the magazines,"
4076,VI.,"His children lead the school,"
4077,VI.,He tries a thousand new machines
4078,VI.,"(And keeps his temper cool),"
4079,VI.,"But bristles at Kentucky jeans,"
4080,VI.,And her impressive mule.
4081,VI.,

4083,VI.,"Enlightening ignorance,"
4084,VI.,Enigmas deeper than the stars
4085,VI.,"He solves as by a glance,"
4086,VI.,And raises cinnamon cigars
4087,VI.,From poor tobacco plants!
4088,VI.,
4089,VI.,"By no decree of fashion dressed,"
4090,VI.,"And busier than Fate,"
4091,VI.,The student-farmer keeps abreast

4093,VI.,"And treasures, like his Sunday vest,"
4094,VI.,"The motto ""Educate!"""

4882,VI.,But simply keeps on going.
4883,VI.,
4884,VI.,"It tells me when I am to eat,"
4885,VI.,Which isn't necessary;
4886,VI.,"When food with me is obsolete,"
4887,VI.,I'll be a reliquary.
4888,VI.,
4889,VI.,"It tells me early when to rise,"
4890,VI.,And bother with _dejeuner_;
4891,VI.,"To sally forth and exercise,"
4892,VI.,And fill up my _porte-monnaie_.
4893,VI.,
4894,VI.,"I hear it talking in the night,"
4895,VI.,As if it were in clover:
4896,VI.,"You've never lost your appetite,"
4897,VI.,You've never been run over.
4898,VI.,
4899,VI.,It makes me wish that I might live
4900,VI.,"More faithful unto duty,"
4901,VI.,And unto others something give
4902,VI.,Like this bijou of beauty.
4903,VI.,
4904,VI.,"It holds its hands before its face,"
4905,VI.,So very modest is it;
4906,VI.,So like the people in the place
4907,VI.,Where I delight to visit.
4908,VI.,
4909,VI.,Sometimes I wonder if it cries
4910,VI.,The course I am pursuing;
4911,VI.,Because it has so many I-s
4912,VI.,And must know what I'm doing.
4913,VI.,
4914,VI.,Sometimes I fear it makes me cry--
4915,VI.,"No matter, and no pity--"
4916,VI.,Afraid at last I'll have to die
4917,VI.,"In some far, foreign city."
4918,VI.,
4919,VI.,It travels with me everywhere
4920,VI.,And chirrups like a cricket;
4921,VI.,"As if it said with anxious air,"
4922,VI.,"""Don't lose your tick-tick-ticket!"""
4923,VI.,
4924,VI.,Companion of my loneliness
4925,VI.,"Along my journey westward,"
4926,VI.,"It never leaves me comfortless,"
4927,VI.,But has the last and best word.
4928,VI.,
4929,VI.,"I would not spoil its lovely face,"
4930,VI.,"And so I go behind it,"
4931,VI.,"And hold it like a china vase,"
4932,VI.,So careful when I wind it.
4933,VI.,
4934,VI.,A clock is always excellent
4935,VI.,"That has its label on,"
4936,VI.,And proves a fine advertisement
4937,VI.,"For Waterbury, Conn."
4938,VI.,
4939,VI.,Those Yankees--ah! they never shun
4940,VI.,"A chance to make a dime,"
4941,VI.,And counterfeit the very sun
4942,VI.,"In keeping ""Standard Time."""
4943,VI.,
4944,VI.,"Ah, well! the little clock has proved"
4945,VI.,The best of all bonanzas;
4946,VI.,And thus my happy heart is moved
4947,VI.,To these effusive stanzas.
4948,VI.,
4949,VI.,
4950,VI.,
4951,VI.,
4952,VI.,Improvement.
4953,VI.,
4954,VI.,
4955,VI.,Along the avenue I pass
4956,VI.,"Huge piles of wood and stone,"
4957,VI.,"And glance at each amorphous mass,"
4958,VI.,"Whose cumbrous weight has crushed the grass,"
4959,VI.,With half resentful groan.
4960,VI.,
4961,VI.,"Say I: ""O labor, to despoil"
4962,VI.,"Some lovely forest scene,"
4963,VI.,"Or at the granite stratum toil,"
4964,VI.,"And desecrate whole roods of soil,"
4965,VI.,Is vandal-like and mean!
4966,VI.,
4967,VI.,"""Than ever to disfigure thus"
4968,VI.,"Our prairie garden-land,"
4969,VI.,"Let me consort with Cerberus,"
4970,VI.,"Be chained to crags precipitous,"
4971,VI.,"Or seek an alien strand."""
4972,VI.,
4973,VI.,"But while this pining, pouting Muse"
4974,VI.,"The interval ignores,"
4975,VI.,"Deft industry, no time to lose,"
4976,VI.,"Contrives and carries, hoists and hews,"
4977,VI.,And symmetry restores.
4978,VI.,
4979,VI.,Behold! of rock and pile and board
4980,VI.,"A modern miracle,"
4981,VI.,"My neighbor's dwelling, roofed and floored,"
4982,VI.,"That rapid grew as Jonah's gourd,"
4983,VI.,And far more beautiful.
4984,VI.,
4985,VI.,The artisan's receding gait
4986,VI.,"Has brushed the chips away,"
4987,VI.,"Where innocence shall recreate,"
4988,VI.,"Or like the flowers grow, and wait"
4989,VI.,The balminess of May.
4990,VI.,
4991,VI.,"An arid spot, where careless feet"
4992,VI.,"Have long been wont to roam,"
4993,VI.,"Where cattle grazed, as if to eat"
4994,VI.,"Were life's delicious, richest treat,"
4995,VI.,Becomes a charming home.
4996,VI.,
4997,VI.,"O man primeval! hadst thou known,"
4998,VI.,"Ere rude hands scooped thy grave,"
4999,VI.,"Of Homestead Act, or Building Loan,"
5000,VI.,Thou wouldst have quite disdained to own
5001,VI.,A rugged cliff or cave.
5002,VI.,
5003,VI.,And now I see how skill and art
5004,VI.,"May cleave fair nature through,"
5005,VI.,"Disintegrate her breathing heart,"
5006,VI.,And to the tissues torn impart
5007,VI.,A use and beauty new.
5008,VI.,
5009,VI.,"And this improvement is, to turn"
5010,VI.,The things which God has given
5011,VI.,"To their best purpose, as we learn"
5012,VI.,To make the place where we sojourn
5013,VI.,Homelike and more like Heaven.
5014,VI.,
5015,VI.,
5016,VI.,
5017,VI.,
5018,VI.,On Bancroft Height.
5019,VI.,
5020,VI.,
5021,VI.,On Bancroft height Aurora's face
5022,VI.,"Shines brighter than a star,"
5023,VI.,"As stepping forth in dewy grace,"
5024,VI.,The gates of day unbar;
5025,VI.,"And lo! the firmament, the hills,"
5026,VI.,And the vales that intervene--
5027,VI.,Creation's self with gladness thrills
5028,VI.,To greet the matin queen.
5029,VI.,
5030,VI.,On Bancroft height the atmosphere
5031,VI.,Is but an endless waft
5032,VI.,"Of life's elixir, pure and clear"
5033,VI.,As mortal ever quaffed;
5034,VI.,And such the sweet salubrity
5035,VI.,"Of air and altitude,"
5036,VI.,Is banished many a malady
5037,VI.,And suffering subdued.
5038,VI.,
5039,VI.,On Bancroft height the sunset glow
5040,VI.,When day departing dies
5041,VI.,Outrivals all that tourists know
5042,VI.,Of famed Italian skies;
5043,VI.,And happy dwellers round about
5044,VI.,Who view the scene aright
5045,VI.,In admiration grow devout
5046,VI.,And laud the Lord of light.
5047,VI.,
5048,VI.,Round Bancroft height rich memories
5049,VI.,"Commingle earth's affairs,"
5050,VI.,"Among the world's celebrities,"
5051,VI.,Of him whose name it bears;
5052,VI.,The scholar-wise compatriot
5053,VI.,Who left to later men
5054,VI.,The grand achievements unforgot
5055,VI.,Of that historic pen.
5056,VI.,
5057,VI.,Fair Bancroft height revisited
5058,VI.,"When all the land is white,"
5059,VI.,A halo crowns its noble head
5060,VI.,Impelling fresh delight;
5061,VI.,The daring wish in winter-time
5062,VI.,The blizzard to defy
5063,VI.,Those shining slippery slopes to climb
5064,VI.,Up nearer to the sky.
5065,VI.,
5066,VI.,Though Boreas abrade the cheek
5067,VI.,"With buffetings of snow,"
5068,VI.,He gives a vigor that the weak
5069,VI.,And languid never know;
5070,VI.,"And with rejuvenescent thrill,"
5071,VI.,"Like children everywhere,"
5072,VI.,"Bestirs the rhapsody, the will"
5073,VI.,To make a snow-man there.
5074,VI.,
5075,VI.,On Bancroft height and Bancroft tower
5076,VI.,Such vistas charm the eye
5077,VI.,"'Twere life's consummate, glorious hour"
5078,VI.,But to behold--and die;
5079,VI.,Yet in the sparkle and the glow
5080,VI.,Is earth so very fair
5081,VI.,"The spirit lingers, loath to go,"
5082,VI.,And dreams of heaven--up there.
5083,VI.,
5084,VI.,
5085,VI.,
5086,VI.,
5087,VI.,A Reformer.
5088,VI.,
5089,VI.,
5090,VI.,"When I was young, my heart elate"
5091,VI.,"With ardent notions warm,"
5092,VI.,I thirsted to inaugurate
5093,VI.,A spirit of reform;
5094,VI.,"The universe was all awry,"
5095,VI.,"Philosophy despite,"
5096,VI.,And mundane things disjointed I
5097,VI.,Was bound to set aright.
5098,VI.,
5099,VI.,"My mind conceived a million plans,"
5100,VI.,"For Hope was brave and strong,"
5101,VI.,But dared not with unaided hands
5102,VI.,Combat a giant wrong;
5103,VI.,So with caress I sought to coax
5104,VI.,Those who had humored me
5105,VI.,In infancy--the dear old folks--
5106,VI.,And gain their sympathy.
5107,VI.,
5108,VI.,But quarreling with extant laws
5109,VI.,They would have deemed a shame
5110,VI.,"Who clung to error, just because"
5111,VI.,Their fathers did the same.
5112,VI.,"I sought in Pleasure's gilded halls,"
5113,VI.,Where grace and beauty stirred
5114,VI.,"At revelry's impetuous calls,"
5115,VI.,To make my projects heard.
5116,VI.,
5117,VI.,Then turned to stately palaces
5118,VI.,"Of luxury and ease,"
5119,VI.,Where wealth's absorbing object was
5120,VI.,The master's whim to please;
5121,VI.,"And spoke of evils unredressed,"
5122,VI.,Of danger yet to be--
5123,VI.,"They only answered, like the rest:"
5124,VI.,"""But what is that to me?"""
5125,VI.,
5126,VI.,And even pious _devotées_
5127,VI.,Whom sacred walls immure
5128,VI.,Condemned me (as by feeble praise)--
5129,VI.,What more could I endure?
5130,VI.,"Down by the stream, so pure and clear"
5131,VI.,"That sunbeams paused to drink,"
5132,VI.,In loneliness and grief sincere
5133,VI.,I pressed its grassy brink.
5134,VI.,
5135,VI.,Thick darkness seemed to veil the day;
5136,VI.,Beyond a realm of tears
5137,VI.,Utopia's land of promise lay;
5138,VI.,And not till later years
5139,VI.,I learned this lesson--that to win
5140,VI.,"Results from labor sure,"
5141,VI.,"""Reformers"" always must begin"
5142,VI.,Among the lowly poor.
5143,VI.,
5144,VI.,For they whose lot privation is
5145,VI.,"And whose delights are few,"
5146,VI.,Whose aggregate of miseries
5147,VI.,"Is want of something new,"
5148,VI.,The measure of whose happiness
5149,VI.,"Is but an empty cup,"
5150,VI.,For every novelty will press
5151,VI.,Alert to fill it up.
