346,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
347,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,We generally speak of a man's descent. In the case of James Russell
348,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Lowell's ancestry it was rather an ascent through eight generations.
349,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Percival Lowle's son, John Lowell, was a worthy cooper in old Newbury;"
350,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"his great-grandson was a shoemaker, his great-great-grandson was the"
351,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Rev. John Lowell of Newburyport, the father of the Hon. John Lowell, who"
352,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,is regarded as the author of the clause in the Massachusetts
353,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Constitution abolishing slavery.
354,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
355,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Judge Lowell's son, Charles, was a Unitarian minister, ""learned,"
356,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"saintly, and discreet."" He married Miss Harriet Traill Spence, of"
357,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Portsmouth,--a woman of superior mind, of great wit, vivacity, and an"
358,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"impetuosity that reached eccentricity. She was of Keltic blood, of a"
359,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"family that came from the Orkneys, and claimed descent from the Sir"
360,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Patrick Spens of ""the grand old ballad."" Several of her family were"
361,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"connected with the American navy. Her father was Keith Spence, purser of"
362,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the frigate ""Philadelphia,"" and a prisoner at Tripoli."
363,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
364,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"By ancestry on both sides, and by connections with the Russells and"
365,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"other distinguished families, Lowell was a good type of the New England"

367,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
368,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He was born on the 22d of February, 1819, at Elmwood, not far from"

373,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Like other houses in ""Tory Row,"" it was abandoned by its owners. Soon"
374,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"afterwards it came into possession of Elbridge Gerry, Governor of"
375,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Massachusetts, and fifth Vice-President of the United States, whose"
376,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"memory and name are kept alive by the term ""_gerrymander_."" It next"
377,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,became the property of Dr. Lowell about a year before the birth of his
378,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"youngest child, and it was the home of the poet until his death."
379,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
380,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,[Footnote 1: Thomas Oliver was graduated from Harvard
381,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"College in the class of 1758. He was a gentleman of fortune,"
382,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,and lived first in Roxbury. He bought the property on
383,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Elmwood Avenue in 1766. When he accepted the royal
384,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"commission of Lieutenant-Governor, he became President of"
385,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the Council appointed by the King. On Sept. 2, 1774, about"
386,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,four thousand Middlesex freeholders assembled at Cambridge
387,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,and compelled the mandamus councillors to resign. The
388,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"President of the Council urged the propriety of delay, but"
389,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the Committee would not spare him. He was forced to sign an
390,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"agreement, ""as a man of honor and a Christian, that he would"
391,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"never hereafter, upon any terms whatsoever, accept a seat at"
392,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,said Board on the present novel and oppressive form of
393,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"government."" He immediately quitted Cambridge; and when the"
394,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,British troops evacuated Boston he accompanied them. By an
395,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"odd coincidence he went to reside at Bristol, England, where"
396,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"he died at the age of eighty-two years, in 1815, shortly"
397,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"before the Lowells, who were of Bristol origin, took"
398,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,possession of his former home. In Underwood's sketch of
399,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Lowell, Thomas Oliver is confused with Chief Justice Peter"
400,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Oliver, a man of a very different type of character.]"
401,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
402,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Lowell's early education was obtained mainly at a school kept nearly
403,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"opposite Elmwood by a retired publisher, an Englishman, Mr. William"
404,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Wells. He also studied in the classical school of Mr. Danial G. Ingraham
405,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,in Boston. He was graduated from Harvard College in the class of 1838.
406,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,He is reported as declaring that he read almost everything except the
407,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"class-books prescribed by the faculty. Lowell says, in one of his early"
408,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"poems referring to Harvard,--"
409,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
410,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""Tho' lightly prized the ribboned parchments three,"
411,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Yet _collegisse juvat_, I am glad"
412,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"That here what colleging was mine I had."""
413,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
414,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He was secretary of the Hasty Pudding Society, and one of the editors of"
415,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the college periodical _Harvardiana_, to which he contributed various"
416,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"articles in prose and verse. His neglect of prescribed studies, and"
417,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"disregard of college discipline, resulted in his rustication just before"
418,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"commencement in 1838. He was sent to Concord, where he resided in the"
419,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"family of Barzillai Frost, and made the acquaintance of Emerson, then"
420,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,beginning to rouse the ire of conservative Unitarianism by his
421,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"transcendental philosophy, of the brilliant but overestimated Margaret"
422,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Fuller, who afterwards severely criticised Lowell's verse, and of other"
423,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,well-known residents of the pretty town. He had been elected poet of his
424,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,class. His removal from college prevented him from delivering the poem
425,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,which was afterwards published anonymously for private distribution. It
426,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"contained a satire on abolitionists and reformers. ""I know the village,"""
427,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"he writes long afterwards in the person of Hosea Biglow, Esquire."
428,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
429,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""I know the village though, was sent there once"
430,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"A-schoolin', 'cause to home I played the dunce!"""
431,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
432,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"On his return to Cambridge he took up the study of law, and, in 1840,"
433,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,received the degree of LL.B. He even went so far as to open an office in
434,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Boston; but it is a question whether there was any actual basis of fact
435,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"in a whimsical sketch of his entitled ""My First Client,"" published in"
436,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the short-lived _Boston Miscellany_, edited by Nathan Hale."
437,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
438,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Several things engrossed Lowell's attention to the exclusion of law.
439,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Society at Cambridge was particularly attractive at that time. Allston
440,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the painter was living at Cambridgeport. Judge Story's pleasant home was
441,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,on Brattle Street. The Fays then occupied the house which has since
442,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"become the seat of Radcliffe College. Longfellow, described as ""a"
443,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"slender, blond young professor,"" was established in the Craigie House."
444,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"The famous names of Dr. Palfrey, Professor Andrews Norton, father of"
445,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Lowell's friend and biographer, the ""saintly"" Henry Ware, and others"
446,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,will occur to the reader. He was fond of walking and knew every inch of
447,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the beautiful ground then called ""Sweet Auburn,"" now turned by the hand"
448,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,of misguided man into that most distressing of monstrosities--a modern
449,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"cemetery. He haunted the poetic shades of the Waverley Oaks, heard the"
450,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"charming music of Beaver Brook, and climbed the hills of Belmont and"
451,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Arlington.
452,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
453,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He himself took his turn in establishing a magazine. In January, 1843,"
454,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"he started _The Pioneer_, to which Hawthorne, John Neal, Miss Barrett,"
455,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Poe, Whittier, Story, Parsons, and others contributed, and which, in"
456,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"spite of such an array of talent, perished untimely during the winds of"
457,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,March.
458,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
459,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He had already published, in 1841, a little volume of poems entitled ""A"
460,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Year's Life."" They were marked by no great originality, betrayed little"
461,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"promise of future eminence, and Margaret Fuller, who reviewed them, was"
462,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"quite right in asserting that ""neither the imagery nor the music of"
463,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Lowell's verses was his own."" The first sonnet in the present volume"
464,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,(page 1) practically acknowledges the force of this criticism. The
465,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,influence of Wordsworth and Tennyson may be distinctly traced in most of
466,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,them. But many of the lines were harsh and many of the rhymes were
467,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,careless. Lowell's later and correcter taste omitted most of them from
468,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,his collected works.
469,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
470,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Not far from Elmwood, but in the adjoining village of Watertown, lived"
471,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"one of Lowell's classmates, whose sister, Maria White, a slender,"
472,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"delicate girl, with a poetic genius in some respects more regulated and"
473,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"lofty than his own, early inspired him with a true and saving love."
474,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Speaking of the influences that moulded his life, George William Curtis"
475,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,says:--
476,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
477,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""The first and most enduring was an early and happy passion"
478,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,for a lovely and high-minded woman who became his wife--the
479,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Egeria who exalted his youth and confirmed his noblest
480,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"aspirations; a heaven-eyed counsellor of the serener air,"
481,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"who filled his mind with peace and his life with joy."""
482,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
483,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,The young lady's prudent father objected to the marriage until the newly
484,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,fledged lawyer should be in a position to support a wife.
485,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
486,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Shortly after the shipwreck of _The Pioneer_, Lowell was offered a"
487,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,hundred dollars by _Graham's Monthly_ for ten poems. When Pegasus is
488,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"able to earn such princely sums, there seems no reason why Love should"
489,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,be kept waiting at the cottage door. In 1844 Lowell published a new
490,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"edition of his poems, and married Miss White. It was her influence that"
491,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,decided him to cast in his lot with the abolitionists. It was her
492,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,refined taste that shaped and tempered his impetuous verse. A volume of
493,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"her poems was in 1855, in an edition of fifty copies, privately printed,"
494,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,and is now very rare. It is an odd circumstance that in Lowell's
495,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"library, from which Harvard College was allowed to select any volumes"
496,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"not in Gore Hall, neither this book nor any of Lowell's own early poems"
497,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,was to be found.
498,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
499,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"The young couple took up their residence at Elmwood, and here were born"
500,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,three daughters and a son. All but one of his children died in infancy.
501,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Many of the tenderest of his poems refer with touching pathos to his
502,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"bereavement: such for instance are ""The Changeling"" and ""The First"
503,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Snowfall."""
504,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
505,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In 1845 appeared ""The Vision of Sir Launfal,""--a genuine inspiration"
506,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,composed in two days in a sort of ecstasy of poetic fervor. That more
507,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,than anything established his fame. He recognized that he was dedicated
508,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,to the Muses.
509,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
510,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,In 1846 he wrote:--
511,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
512,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""If I have any vocation, it is the making of verse. When I"
513,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"take my pen for that, the world opens itself ungrudgingly"
514,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"before me; everything seems clear and easy, as it seems"
515,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,sinking to the bottom could be as one leans over the edge of
516,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,his boat in one of those dear coves at Fresh Pond.... My
517,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,true place is to serve the cause as a poet. Then my heart
518,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"leaps before me into the conflict."""
519,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
520,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"The same year he began his ""Biglow Papers"" in the Boston _Courier_. Such"
521,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,_jeux d'esprit_ are apt to be ephemeral. Lowell's are immortal. They
522,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,preserved in literary form a fast-fading dialect; they caught and
523,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,embalmed the mighty issues of a tremendous world-problem. Their
524,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"influence was incalculable. He gathered them into a volume in 1848, and"
525,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,became corresponding editor of the _Anti-Slavery Standard_. Fortunate
526,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,man who throws himself into an unpopular cause which is in harmony with
527,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the Right! How different from Wordsworth who attacked the ballot and
528,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,took sides against reform!
529,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
530,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Lowell's penchant for satire was exemplified again the same year in his
531,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""Fable for Critics."""
532,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
533,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,In this Lowell with no sparing hand laid on his portraits most droll and
534,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"amusing colors. It is a comic portrait gallery, a series of caricatures"
535,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,whose greatest value (as in all good caricatures) lies in the accurate
536,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,presentation of characteristic features. He did not spare himself:--
537,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
538,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""There is Lowell, who's striving Parnassus to climb"
539,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,With a whole bale of _isms_ tied together with rhyme.
540,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He might get on alone, spite of troubles and bowlders,"
541,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,But he can't with that bundle he has on his shoulders.

546,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,And rattle away till he's old as Methusalem
547,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"At the head of a march to the last New Jerusalem."""
548,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
549,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Some of his thrusts left embittered feelings, but in general the tone"
550,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"was so good-natured that only the thin-skinned could object, and it must"
551,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,be confessed many of his judgments have been confirmed by Time.
552,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
553,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In 1851 Lowell visited Europe, and spent upwards of a year widening his"
554,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,acquaintance with the polite languages. But it is remarkable that Lowell
555,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,gave the world almost no metrical translations. Shortly after his return
556,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"his wife died (Oct. 27, 1853) after a slow decline. In reference to this"
557,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"bereavement Longfellow wrote his beautiful poem, ""The Two Angels."""
558,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
559,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,The following year Longfellow resigned the Smith Professorship of the
560,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"French and Spanish Languages and Literature and Belles Lettres, and"
561,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Lowell was appointed his successor with two years' leave of absence. He
562,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"had won his spurs. He had collected his poems in two volumes, not"
563,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"including ""A Year's Life,"" the ""Biglow Papers,"" or the ""Fable for"
564,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Critics."" He was known as one of the most brilliant contributors to"
565,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,_Putnam's Monthly_ and other magazines.
566,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
567,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,In 1854 he delivered a series of twelve lectures on English poetry
568,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,before the Lowell Institute. Ten years before he had published a volume
569,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"of ""Conversations on the Poets."" The contrast between the two works is"
570,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,no less pronounced than that between his earlier and later poems.
571,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
572,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In both, however, there is a tendency toward a confusing"
573,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"over-elaboration--Metaphors trample on the heels of Similes, and quaint"
574,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"and often grotesque conceits sometimes pall upon the taste, just as in"
575,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the poems a flash of incongruous wit sometimes disturbs the serenity
576,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,that is desirable.
577,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
578,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"On his return from Europe, Mr. Lowell occupied the chair which he"
579,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,adorned by his brilliant attainments and made memorable by his fame. He
580,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"lectured on Dante, Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Cervantes, and delighted"
581,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,his audiences. At the same time he was editor of the _Atlantic Monthly_
582,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,for several years. From 1863 until 1872 he was associated with Professor
583,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Charles Eliot Norton in the conduct of the _North American Review_.
584,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
585,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In 1857 he married Miss Frances Dunlap of Portland, Me., a cultivated"
586,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,lady who had been the governess of his daughter. She had unerring
587,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"literary taste and sound judgment, and Mr. Lowell soon came to entrust"
588,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,to her the management of his financial affairs. She was enabled to make
589,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,their comparatively small income more than meet the exigencies of an
590,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,exacting position.
591,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
592,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"The second series of the ""Biglow Papers,"" relating to the War of the"
593,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Rebellion, were first published in the _Atlantic_. They were collected"
594,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,into a volume in 1865. That year was rendered notable by his
595,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""Commemoration Ode,"" the worthy crowning of one of the grandest poetic"
596,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"opportunities ever granted to man. ""Under the Willows"" appeared in 1869;"
597,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""The Cathedral"" in 1870."
598,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
599,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,In 1864 he had issued a collection of his early descriptive articles
600,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"under the title, ""Fireside Travels."" In 1870 came ""Among my Books."" The"
601,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"second series followed in 1876. ""My Study Windows"" was published in"
602,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"1871. All these prose works were marked by an exuberant, vivid, poetic,"
603,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,impassioned style. The tropical efflorescence of imagery was
604,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"characteristic of them all. He ought to have remembered his own words,--"
605,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
606,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose."""
607,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
608,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In 1876 appeared three memorial poems: that read at Concord, April 19,"
609,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"1875; that read at Cambridge under the Washington Elm, July 3, 1875; and"
610,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the Fourth of July Ode of 1876. This year Mr. Lowell was appointed one
611,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,of the presidential electors; and the following year President Hayes
612,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"first offered him the Austrian mission, and, on his refusal of that,"
613,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"gave him the honorary post at Madrid, which had been adorned by Everett,"
614,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Irving, and Prescott. He was there three years, and, on the retirement"
615,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"of Mr. Welsh in 1880, was transferred to the Court of St. James, or, as"
616,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"one of the English papers expressed it, he became ""His Excellency the"
617,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Ambassador of American Literature to the Court of Shakespeare."""
618,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
619,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He was extremely popular. Known in private as ""one of the most"
620,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"marvellous of story-tellers,"" he became the lion of many public"
621,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"occasions. The _London News_ spoke of the ""Extraordinary felicity of his"
622,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"occasional speeches."" At Birmingham he delivered a noble address on"
623,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Democracy. He was selected to deliver the oration at the dedication of
624,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the Dean Stanley Memorial. He spoke on Fielding at Taunton, on Coleridge"
625,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"at Westminster Abbey, on Gray at Cambridge. He was President of the"
626,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Wordsworth Society. All sorts of honors were heaped upon him, both at"
627,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,home and abroad.
628,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
629,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He returned to America in 1885, and once more occupied the somewhat"
630,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,dilapidated historic mansion at Elmwood.  Once more he moved amid his
631,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"rare and precious books, and heard the birds singing in the elms that"
632,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"his father had planted, or in the clustered bushes back of the house. He"
633,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,took a deep interest in the struggle for international copyright. He was
634,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"President of the American Copyright League, and wrote the memorable"
635,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,lines:--
636,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
637,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"""In vain we call old notions fudge,"
638,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,And bend our conscience to our dealing;
639,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,The Ten Commandments will not budge;
640,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"And stealing _will_ continue stealing."""
641,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
642,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,He used the leisure of his failing health in revising his works. His
643,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"last volume of poems was entitled ""Heart's Ease and Rue."" One of his"
644,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"latest poems, ""My Book,"" appeared in the Christmas number of the New"
645,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,York _Ledger_ in 1890. In the December number of the _Atlantic_ his hand
646,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"was visible in the anonymous ""Contributor's Club."""
647,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
648,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,During the last years his health was a matter of grave anxiety to his
649,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,friends. In the spring of 1891 he seemed better. He was engaged in
650,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,writing a life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. When the present writer call to
651,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"see him one beautiful spring day, he found him in his library, at that"
652,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,moment engaged in making suggestions for the inscriptions on the new
653,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Boston Public Library. His manner was the perfection of courtesy and
654,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,high breeding. His keen eyes seemed to read the very soul. Simplicity
655,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"and beautiful dignity, tempered by evident feebleness of health, made"
656,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,him a memorable figure.
657,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
658,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Toward the end of the summer he suddenly grew more seriously ill. He
659,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"suffered severely, and his last words were, ""Oh! why don't you let me"
660,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"die?"""
661,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
662,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"He drew his last breath in the early morning of Aug. 12, 1891. He was"
663,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"buried at Mount Auburn, in the shadow of Indian Ridge, not far from"
664,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Longfellow's grave, in a lot unenclosed and marked by no monument."
665,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
666,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Memorial services were held in many places. Lord Tennyson cabled a
667,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"message of sympathy: ""England and America will mourn Mr. Lowell's death."
668,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"They loved him and he loved them."" The Queen publicly expressed her"
669,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,respect and sorrow.
670,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
671,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Few men have left a deeper impress on their age. Few men have used noble
672,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,powers more nobly. In private life and public station there is not a
673,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,shadow to stain the whiteness of his fame.
674,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
675,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,As a poet he stands in the front rank of those who have yet appeared in
676,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,America. As a critic he was generous and just; as a humorist he used his
677,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,shafts of ridicule only to wound wrong; as a statesman and diplomat he
678,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"was actuated by broad, far-seeing views; as a man he was a type to be"
679,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,upheld and followed. America has just cause to reverence his memory; and
680,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the whole English-speaking world, without geographical distinction,"
681,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,claims him as its own.

724,HAKON'S LAY.,
725,HAKON'S LAY.,"Then the old man arose: white-haired he stood,"
726,HAKON'S LAY.,"White-bearded, and with eyes that looked afar"
727,HAKON'S LAY.,"From their still region of perpetual snow,"
728,HAKON'S LAY.,Over the little smokes and stirs of men:
729,HAKON'S LAY.,"His head was bowed with gathered flakes of years,"

949,IN SADNESS.,Where the harvest-time of faith sublime
950,IN SADNESS.,Not always is to be--
951,IN SADNESS.,
952,IN SADNESS.,Yet would the true soul rather choose
953,IN SADNESS.,"Its home where sorrow is,"

956,IN SADNESS.,The rainbow hues that bend profuse
957,IN SADNESS.,O'er cloudy spheres like this--
958,IN SADNESS.,
959,IN SADNESS.,"The want, the sorrow and the pain,"

963,IN SADNESS.,"That makes us fain strong hearts to gain,"
964,IN SADNESS.,To do and to endure.
965,IN SADNESS.,
966,IN SADNESS.,High natures must be thunder-scarred

998,FAREWELL.,
999,FAREWELL.,Farewell! as the bee round the blossom
1000,FAREWELL.,"Doth murmur drowsily,"
1001,FAREWELL.,So murmureth round my bosom
1002,FAREWELL.,The memory of thee;
1003,FAREWELL.,"Lingering, it seems to go,"
1004,FAREWELL.,"When the wind more full doth flow,"
1005,FAREWELL.,"Waving the flower to and fro,"
1006,FAREWELL.,"But still returneth, Marian!"
1007,FAREWELL.,
1008,FAREWELL.,"My hope no longer burneth,"
1009,FAREWELL.,"Which did so fiercely burn,"
1010,FAREWELL.,"My joy to sorrow turneth,"
1011,FAREWELL.,"Although loath, loath to turn--"
1012,FAREWELL.,I would forget--
1013,FAREWELL.,And yet--and yet
1014,FAREWELL.,"My heart to thee still yearneth, Marian!"
1015,FAREWELL.,
1016,FAREWELL.,"Fair as a single star thou shinest,"
1017,FAREWELL.,And white as lilies are
1018,FAREWELL.,The slender hands wherewith thou twinest
1019,FAREWELL.,Thy heavy auburn hair;
1020,FAREWELL.,Thou art to me
1021,FAREWELL.,A memory
1022,FAREWELL.,Of all that is divinest:
1023,FAREWELL.,"Thou art so fair and tall,"
1024,FAREWELL.,"Thy looks so queenly are,"
1025,FAREWELL.,"Thy very shadow on the wall,"
1026,FAREWELL.,"Thy step upon the stair,"
1027,FAREWELL.,"The thought that thou art nigh,"
1028,FAREWELL.,The chance look of thine eye
1029,FAREWELL.,"Are more to me than all, Marian,"
1030,FAREWELL.,And will be till I die!
1031,FAREWELL.,
1032,FAREWELL.,As the last quiver of a bell
1033,FAREWELL.,"Doth fade into the air,"
1034,FAREWELL.,With a subsiding swell
1035,FAREWELL.,"That dies we know not where,"
1036,FAREWELL.,So my hope melted and was gone:
1037,FAREWELL.,I raised mine eyes to bless the star
1038,FAREWELL.,That shared its light with me so far
1039,FAREWELL.,"Below its silver throne,"
1040,FAREWELL.,And gloom and chilling vacancy
1041,FAREWELL.,"Were all was left to me,"
1042,FAREWELL.,"In the dark, bleak night I was alone!"
1043,FAREWELL.,"Alone in the blessed Earth, Marian,"
1044,FAREWELL.,For what were all to me--
1045,FAREWELL.,"Its love, and light, and mirth, Marian,"
1046,FAREWELL.,If I were not with thee?
1047,FAREWELL.,
1048,FAREWELL.,My heart will not forget thee
1049,FAREWELL.,More than the moaning brine
1050,FAREWELL.,Forgets the moon when she is set;
1051,FAREWELL.,The gush when first I met thee
1052,FAREWELL.,"That thrilled my brain like wine,"
1053,FAREWELL.,Doth thrill as madly yet;
1054,FAREWELL.,"My heart cannot forget thee,"
1055,FAREWELL.,"Though it may droop and pine,"
1056,FAREWELL.,Too deeply it had set thee
1057,FAREWELL.,In every love of mine;
1058,FAREWELL.,"No new moon ever cometh,"
1059,FAREWELL.,"No flower ever bloometh,"
1060,FAREWELL.,No twilight ever gloometh
1061,FAREWELL.,But I'm more only thine.
1062,FAREWELL.,"Oh look not on me, Marian,"
1063,FAREWELL.,"Thine eyes are wild and deep,"
1064,FAREWELL.,"And they have won me, Marian,"
1065,FAREWELL.,From peacefulness and sleep;
1066,FAREWELL.,"The sunlight doth not sun me,"
1067,FAREWELL.,"The meek moonshine doth shun me,"
1068,FAREWELL.,All sweetest voices stun me--
1069,FAREWELL.,There is no rest
1070,FAREWELL.,Within my breast
1071,FAREWELL.,"And I can only weep, Marian!"
1072,FAREWELL.,
1073,FAREWELL.,As a landbird far at sea
1074,FAREWELL.,Doth wander through the sleet
1075,FAREWELL.,And drooping downward wearily
1076,FAREWELL.,"Finds no rest for her feet,"
1077,FAREWELL.,So wandereth my memory
1078,FAREWELL.,O'er the years when we did meet:
1079,FAREWELL.,I used to say that everything
1080,FAREWELL.,"Partook a share of thee,"
1081,FAREWELL.,"That not a little bird could sing,"
1082,FAREWELL.,"Or green leaf flutter on a tree,"
1083,FAREWELL.,That nothing could be beautiful
1084,FAREWELL.,"Save part of thee were there,"
1085,FAREWELL.,That from thy soul so clear and full
1086,FAREWELL.,All bright and bless√®d things did cull
1087,FAREWELL.,The charm to make them fair;
1088,FAREWELL.,And now I know
1089,FAREWELL.,"That it was so,"
1090,FAREWELL.,Thy spirit through the earth doth flow
1091,FAREWELL.,And face me wheresoe'er I go--
1092,FAREWELL.,What right hath perfectness to give
1093,FAREWELL.,Such weary weight of woe
1094,FAREWELL.,Unto the soul which cannot live
1095,FAREWELL.,On anything more low?
1096,FAREWELL.,"Oh leave me, leave me, Marian,"
1097,FAREWELL.,There's no fair thing I see
1098,FAREWELL.,"But doth deceive me, Marian,"
1099,FAREWELL.,Into sad dreams of thee!
1100,FAREWELL.,
1101,FAREWELL.,A cold snake gnaws my heart
1102,FAREWELL.,"And crushes round my brain,"
1103,FAREWELL.,And I should glory but to part
1104,FAREWELL.,"So bitterly again,"
1105,FAREWELL.,Feeling the slow tears start
1106,FAREWELL.,And fall in fiery rain:
1107,FAREWELL.,"There's a wide ring round the moon,"
1108,FAREWELL.,"The ghost-like clouds glide by,"
1109,FAREWELL.,And I hear the sad winds croon
1110,FAREWELL.,A dirge to the lowering sky;
1111,FAREWELL.,There's nothing soft or mild
1112,FAREWELL.,"In the pale moon's sickly light,"
1113,FAREWELL.,But all looks strange and wild
1114,FAREWELL.,"Through the dim, foreboding night:"
1115,FAREWELL.,I think thou must be dead
1116,FAREWELL.,"In some dark and lonely place,"
1117,FAREWELL.,"With candles at thy head,"
1118,FAREWELL.,And a pall above thee spread
1119,FAREWELL.,"To hide thy dead, cold face;"
1120,FAREWELL.,But I can see thee underneath
1121,FAREWELL.,"So pale, and still, and fair,"
1122,FAREWELL.,Thine eyes closed smoothly and a wreath
1123,FAREWELL.,Of flowers in thy hair;
1124,FAREWELL.,I never saw thy face so clear
1125,FAREWELL.,"When thou wast with the living,"
1126,FAREWELL.,"As now beneath the pall, so drear,"
1127,FAREWELL.,"And stiff, and unforgiving;"
1128,FAREWELL.,"I cannot flee thee, Marian,"
1129,FAREWELL.,"I cannot turn away,"
1130,FAREWELL.,"Mine eyes must see thee, Marian,"
1131,FAREWELL.,Through salt tears night and day.
1132,FAREWELL.,
1133,FAREWELL.,
1134,FAREWELL.,
1135,FAREWELL.,
1136,A DIRGE.,A DIRGE.
1137,A DIRGE.,
1138,A DIRGE.,
1139,A DIRGE.,"Poet! lonely is thy bed,"
1140,A DIRGE.,And the turf is overhead--
1141,A DIRGE.,Cold earth is thy cover;
1142,A DIRGE.,"But thy heart hath found release,"
1143,A DIRGE.,And it slumbers full of peace
1144,A DIRGE.,'Neath the rustle of green trees
1145,A DIRGE.,"And the warm hum of the bees,"
1146,A DIRGE.,Mid the drowsy clover;
1147,A DIRGE.,"Through thy chamber, still as death,"
1148,A DIRGE.,"A smooth gurgle wandereth,"
1149,A DIRGE.,As the blue stream murmureth
1150,A DIRGE.,To the blue sky over.
1151,A DIRGE.,"Three paces from the silver strand,"
1152,A DIRGE.,"Gently in the fine, white sand,"
1153,A DIRGE.,"With a lily in thy hand,"
1154,A DIRGE.,"Pale as snow, they laid thee;"
1155,A DIRGE.,"In no coarse earth wast thou hid,"
1156,A DIRGE.,And no gloomy coffin-lid
1157,A DIRGE.,Darkly overweighed thee.
1158,A DIRGE.,"Silently as snow-flakes drift,"
1159,A DIRGE.,The smooth sand did sift and sift
1160,A DIRGE.,O'er the bed they made thee;
1161,A DIRGE.,All sweet birds did come and sing
1162,A DIRGE.,At thy sunny burying--
1163,A DIRGE.,"Choristers unbidden,"
1164,A DIRGE.,"And, beloved of sun and dew,"
1165,A DIRGE.,Meek forget-me-nots upgrew
1166,A DIRGE.,Where thine eyes so large and blue
1167,A DIRGE.,'Neath the turf were hidden.
1168,A DIRGE.,
1169,A DIRGE.,"Where thy stainless clay doth lie,"
1170,A DIRGE.,"Blue and open is the sky,"
1171,A DIRGE.,"And the white clouds wander by,"
1172,A DIRGE.,Dreams of summer silently
1173,A DIRGE.,Darkening the river;
1174,A DIRGE.,Thou hearest the clear water run;
1175,A DIRGE.,"And the ripples every one,"
1176,A DIRGE.,"Scattering the golden sun,"
1177,A DIRGE.,Through thy silence quiver;
1178,A DIRGE.,"Vines trail down upon the stream,"
1179,A DIRGE.,Into its smooth and glassy dream
1180,A DIRGE.,"A green stillness spreading,"
1181,A DIRGE.,"And the shiner, perch, and bream"
1182,A DIRGE.,Through the shadowed waters gleam
1183,A DIRGE.,'Gainst the current heading.
1184,A DIRGE.,
1185,A DIRGE.,"White as snow, thy winding sheet"
1186,A DIRGE.,"Shelters thee from head to feet,"
1187,A DIRGE.,Save thy pale face only;
1188,A DIRGE.,"Thy face is turned toward the skies,"
1189,A DIRGE.,"The lids lie meekly o'er thine eyes,"
1190,A DIRGE.,And the low-voiced pine-tree sighs
1191,A DIRGE.,O'er thy bed so lonely.
1192,A DIRGE.,All thy life thou lov'dst its shade:
1193,A DIRGE.,"Underneath it thou art laid,"
1194,A DIRGE.,In an endless shelter;
1195,A DIRGE.,Thou hearest it forever sigh
1196,A DIRGE.,As the wind's vague longings die
1197,A DIRGE.,In its branches dim and high--
1198,A DIRGE.,Thou hear'st the waters gliding by
1199,A DIRGE.,Slumberously welter.
1200,A DIRGE.,
1201,A DIRGE.,"Thou wast full of love and truth,"
1202,A DIRGE.,Of forgiveness and ruth--
1203,A DIRGE.,Thy great heart with hope and youth
1204,A DIRGE.,Tided to o'erflowing.
1205,A DIRGE.,"Thou didst dwell in mysteries,"
1206,A DIRGE.,And there lingered on thine eyes
1207,A DIRGE.,"Shadows of serener skies,"
1208,A DIRGE.,"Awfully wild memories,"
1209,A DIRGE.,That were like foreknowing;
1210,A DIRGE.,"Through the earth thou would'st have gone,"
1211,A DIRGE.,"Lighted from within alone,"
1212,A DIRGE.,Seeds from flowers in Heaven grown
1213,A DIRGE.,With a free hand sowing.
1214,A DIRGE.,
1215,A DIRGE.,Thou didst remember well and long
1216,A DIRGE.,"Some fragments of thine angel-song,"
1217,A DIRGE.,"And strive, through want of woe and wrong,"
1218,A DIRGE.,To win the world unto it;
1219,A DIRGE.,Thy sin it was to see and hear
1220,A DIRGE.,Beyond To-day's dim hemisphere--
1221,A DIRGE.,"Beyond all mists of hope and fear,"
1222,A DIRGE.,"Into a life more true and clear,"
1223,A DIRGE.,And dearly thou didst rue it;
1224,A DIRGE.,"Light of the new world thou hadst won,"
1225,A DIRGE.,O'erflooded by a purer sun--
1226,A DIRGE.,"Slowly Fate's ship came drifting on,"
1227,A DIRGE.,"And through the dark, save thou, not one"
1228,A DIRGE.,Caught of the land a token.
1229,A DIRGE.,"Thou stood'st upon the farthest prow,"
1230,A DIRGE.,"Something within thy soul said ""Now!"""
1231,A DIRGE.,"And leaping forth with eager brow,"
1232,A DIRGE.,Thou fell'st on shore heart-broken.
1233,A DIRGE.,
1234,A DIRGE.,Long time thy brethren stood in fear;
1235,A DIRGE.,"Only the breakers far and near,"
1236,A DIRGE.,"White with their anger, they could hear;"
1237,A DIRGE.,"The sounds of land, which thy quick ear"
1238,A DIRGE.,"Caught long ago, they heard not."
1239,A DIRGE.,"And, when at last they reached the strand,"
1240,A DIRGE.,They found thee lying on the sand
1241,A DIRGE.,"With some wild flowers in thy hand,"
1242,A DIRGE.,But thy cold bosom stirred not;
1243,A DIRGE.,"They listened, but they heard no sound"
1244,A DIRGE.,Save from the glad life all around
1245,A DIRGE.,"A low, contented murmur."
1246,A DIRGE.,"The long grass flowed adown the hill,"
1247,A DIRGE.,"A hum rose from a hidden rill,"
1248,A DIRGE.,"But thy glad heart, that knew no ill"
1249,A DIRGE.,"But too much love, lay dead and still--"
1250,A DIRGE.,The only thing that sent a chill
1251,A DIRGE.,Into the heart of summer.
1252,A DIRGE.,
1253,A DIRGE.,Thou didst not seek the poet's wreath
1254,A DIRGE.,But too soon didst win it;
1255,A DIRGE.,"Without 'twas green, but underneath"
1256,A DIRGE.,"Were scorn and loneliness and death,"
1257,A DIRGE.,"Gnawing the brain with burning teeth,"
1258,A DIRGE.,And making mock within it.
1259,A DIRGE.,"Thou, who wast full of nobleness,"
1260,A DIRGE.,"Whose very life-blood 'twas to bless,"
1261,A DIRGE.,"Whose soul's one law was giving,"
1262,A DIRGE.,"Must bandy words with wickedness,"
1263,A DIRGE.,"Haggle with hunger and distress,"
1264,A DIRGE.,To win that death which worldliness
1265,A DIRGE.,Calls bitterly a living.
1266,A DIRGE.,
1267,A DIRGE.,"""Thou sow'st no gold, and shalt not reap!"""
1268,A DIRGE.,"Muttered earth, turning in her sleep;"
1269,A DIRGE.,"""Come home to the Eternal Deep!"""
1270,A DIRGE.,"Murmured a voice, and a wide sweep"
1271,A DIRGE.,"Of wings through thy soul's hush did creep,"
1272,A DIRGE.,As of thy doom o'erflying;
1273,A DIRGE.,It seem'd that thy strong heart would leap
1274,A DIRGE.,"Out of thy breast, and thou didst weep,"
1275,A DIRGE.,But not with fear of dying;
1276,A DIRGE.,"Men could not fathom thy deep fears,"
1277,A DIRGE.,"They could not understand thy tears,"
1278,A DIRGE.,The hoarded agony of years
1279,A DIRGE.,Of bitter self-denying.
1280,A DIRGE.,"So once, when high above the spheres"
1281,A DIRGE.,"Thy spirit sought its starry peers,"
1282,A DIRGE.,It came not back to face the jeers
1283,A DIRGE.,Of brothers who denied it;
1284,A DIRGE.,"Star-crowned, thou dost possess the deeps"
1285,A DIRGE.,"Of God, and thy white body sleeps"
1286,A DIRGE.,Where the lone pine forever keeps
1287,A DIRGE.,Patient watch beside it.
1288,A DIRGE.,
1289,A DIRGE.,"Poet! underneath the turf,"
1290,A DIRGE.,"Soft thou sleepest, free from morrow,"
1291,A DIRGE.,Thou hast struggled through the surf
1292,A DIRGE.,Of wild thoughts and want and sorrow.
1293,A DIRGE.,"Now, beneath the moaning pine,"
1294,A DIRGE.,"Full of rest, thy body lieth,"
1295,A DIRGE.,"While far up is clear sunshine,"
1296,A DIRGE.,"Underneath a sky divine,"
1297,A DIRGE.,Her loosed wings thy spirit trieth;
1298,A DIRGE.,"Oft she strove to spread them here,"
1299,A DIRGE.,But they were too white and clear
1300,A DIRGE.,For our dingy atmosphere.
1301,A DIRGE.,
1302,A DIRGE.,Thy body findeth ample room
1303,A DIRGE.,In its still and grassy tomb
1304,A DIRGE.,By the silent river;
1305,A DIRGE.,But thy spirit found the earth
1306,A DIRGE.,Narrow for the mighty birth
1307,A DIRGE.,Which it dreamed of ever;
1308,A DIRGE.,Thou wast guilty of a rhyme
1309,A DIRGE.,"Learned in a benigner clime,"
1310,A DIRGE.,"And of that more grievous crime,"
1311,A DIRGE.,An ideal too sublime
1312,A DIRGE.,For the low-hung sky of Time.
1313,A DIRGE.,
1314,A DIRGE.,The calm spot where thy body lies
1315,A DIRGE.,"Gladdens thy soul in Paradise,"
1316,A DIRGE.,It is so still and holy;
1317,A DIRGE.,"Thy body sleeps serenely there,"
1318,A DIRGE.,"And well for it thy soul may care,"
1319,A DIRGE.,"It was so beautiful and fair,"
1320,A DIRGE.,Lily white so wholly.
1321,A DIRGE.,From so pure and sweet a frame
1322,A DIRGE.,"Thy spirit parted as it came,"
1323,A DIRGE.,Gentle as a maiden;
1324,A DIRGE.,Now it lieth full of rest--
1325,A DIRGE.,Sods are lighter on its breast
1326,A DIRGE.,"Than the great, prophetic guest"
1327,A DIRGE.,Wherewith it was laden.

1793,THE SERENADE.,"In the noontide swayeth he,"
1794,THE SERENADE.,Half rested on the slender stalks
1795,THE SERENADE.,That edge those well-known garden walks;
1796,THE SERENADE.,Hearest thou the fitful whirring
1797,THE SERENADE.,Of the humbird's viewless wings--
1798,THE SERENADE.,Feel'st not round thy heart the stirring
1799,THE SERENADE.,Of childhood's half-forgotten things?
1800,THE SERENADE.,
1801,THE SERENADE.,Seest thou the dear old dwelling
1802,THE SERENADE.,With the woodbine round the door?
1803,THE SERENADE.,"Brothers, soft! her breast is swelling"
1804,THE SERENADE.,With the busy thoughts of yore;
1805,THE SERENADE.,"Lowly sing ye, sing ye mildly,"

1812,THE SERENADE.,"In a clear note, rising, sinking,"
1813,THE SERENADE.,Like a thrush's song in June?
1814,THE SERENADE.,Whose laugh is that which rings so clear

1816,THE SERENADE.,
1817,THE SERENADE.,"Lower, Brothers, yet more low"
1818,THE SERENADE.,Weave the song in mazy twines;
1819,THE SERENADE.,She heareth now the west wind blow
1820,THE SERENADE.,At evening through the clump of pines;
1821,THE SERENADE.,"O! mournful is their tune,"
1822,THE SERENADE.,As of a craz√®d thing
1823,THE SERENADE.,"Who, to herself alone,"
1824,THE SERENADE.,"Is ever murmuring,"
1825,THE SERENADE.,"Through the night and through the day,"

1827,THE SERENADE.,"Often, Lady, hast thou listened,"

1829,THE SERENADE.,Where the summer evening breeze
1830,THE SERENADE.,"Moaned sadly through those lonely trees,"
1831,THE SERENADE.,Or with the fierce wind from the north
1832,THE SERENADE.,Wrung their mournful music forth.

1837,THE SERENADE.,And mingling with her dream;
1838,THE SERENADE.,Onward still the river sweepeth
1839,THE SERENADE.,With a sound of long-agone;
1840,THE SERENADE.,"Lowly, Brothers, lo! she weepeth,"
1841,THE SERENADE.,She is now no more alone;
1842,THE SERENADE.,Long-loved forms and long-loved faces

1845,THE SERENADE.,Flow the waters of our song.
1846,THE SERENADE.,Lady! if thy life be holy
1847,THE SERENADE.,"As when thou wert yet a child,"
1848,THE SERENADE.,"Though our song be melancholy,"
1849,THE SERENADE.,It will stir no anguish wild;
1850,THE SERENADE.,"For the soul that hath lived well,"

5733,I.,"In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder,"
5734,I.,The Poet's song with blood-warm truth was rife;
5735,I.,He saw the mysteries which circle under
5736,I.,The outward shell and skin of daily life.
5737,I.,"Nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion,"
5738,I.,His soul was led by the eternal law;
5739,I.,"There was in him no hope of fame, no passion,"
5740,I.,"But, with calm, god-like eyes, he only saw."
5741,I.,"He did not sigh o'er heroes dead and buried,"
5742,I.,"Chief-mourner at the Golden Age's hearse,"
5743,I.,Nor deem that souls whom Charon grim had ferried
5744,I.,Alone were fitting themes of epic verse:
5745,I.,"He could believe the promise of to-morrow,"
5746,I.,And feel the wondrous meaning of to-day;
5747,I.,He had a deeper faith in holy sorrow
5748,I.,Than the world's seeming loss could take away.
5749,I.,"To know the heart of all things was his duty,"
5750,I.,"All things did sing to him to make him wise,"
5751,I.,"And, with a sorrowful and conquering beauty,"
5752,I.,The soul of all looked grandly from his eyes.
5753,I.,"He gazed on all within him and without him,"

5755,I.,And shapes of glory floated all about him
5756,I.,"And whispered to him, and he prophesied."
5757,I.,"Than all men he more fearless was and freer,"
5758,I.,"And all his brethren cried with one accord,--"
5759,I.,"""Behold the holy man! Behold the Seer!"

5761,I.,He to his heart with large embrace had taken

5763,I.,"And, from that root, a shelter never shaken,"
5764,I.,The tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind.
5765,I.,He could interpret well the wondrous voices

5767,I.,He knew that the One Soul no more rejoices
5768,I.,In the star's anthem than the insect's hum.
5769,I.,"He in his heart was ever meek and humble,"
5770,I.,"And yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran,"
5771,I.,As he foresaw how all things false should crumble
5772,I.,"Before the free, uplifted soul of man:"
5773,I.,"And, when he was made full to overflowing"
5774,I.,"With all the loveliness of heaven and earth,"
5775,I.,"Out rushed his song, like molten iron glowing,"
5776,I.,To show God sitting by the humblest hearth.
5777,I.,With calmest courage he was ever ready

5779,I.,"And, with strong arm and purpose firm and steady,"
5780,I.,An anchor for the drifting world he wrought.
5781,I.,So did he make the meanest man partaker
5782,I.,Of all his brother-gods unto him gave;
5783,I.,"All souls did reverence him and name him Maker,"
5784,I.,And when he died heaped temples on his grave.

5817,II.,"O, prophesy no more, but be the Poet!"
5818,II.,This longing was but granted unto thee
5819,II.,"That, when all beauty thou couldst feel and know it,"

5834,II.,"Where'er there lingers but a shade of wrong,"
5835,II.,"There still is need of martyrs and apostles,"

6314,II.,"His loved one's eyes could poet ever speak,"
6315,II.,"So kind, so dewy, and so deep were hers,--"
6316,II.,"But, while he strives, the choicest phrase, too weak"
6317,II.,Their glad reflection in his spirit blurs;
6318,II.,As one may see a dream dissolve and break
6319,II.,"Out of his grasp when he to tell it stirs,"
6320,II.,Like that sad Dryad doomed no more to bless
6321,II.,The mortal who revealed her loveliness.
6322,II.,
6323,II.,
6324,III.,III.
6325,III.,
6326,III.,"She dwelt forever in a region bright,"
6327,III.,"Peopled with living fancies of her own,"
6328,III.,"Where naught could come but visions of delight,"
6329,III.,"Far, far aloof from earth's eternal moan:"
6330,III.,"A summer cloud thrilled through with rosy light,"
6331,III.,"Floating beneath the blue sky all alone,"
6332,III.,"Her spirit wandered by itself, and won"
6333,III.,A golden edge from some unsetting sun.

6339,IV.,"God blesses want with larger sympathies,--"
6340,IV.,"Love enters gladliest at the humble door,"
6341,IV.,And makes the cot a palace with his eyes;
6342,IV.,"So Margaret's heart a softer beauty wore,"
6343,IV.,"And grew in gentleness and patience wise,"
6344,IV.,"For she was but a simple herdsman's child,"
6345,IV.,A lily chance-sown in the rugged wild.
6346,IV.,
6347,IV.,
6348,V.,V.
6349,V.,
6350,V.,There was no beauty of the wood or field
6351,V.,"But she its fragrant bosom-secret knew,"
6352,V.,Nor any but to her would freely yield
6353,V.,Some grace that in her soul took root and grew:
6354,V.,"Nature to her glowed ever new-revealed,"
6355,V.,"All rosy fresh with innocent morning dew,"
6356,V.,"And looked into her heart with dim, sweet eyes"
6357,V.,That left it full of sylvan memories.
6358,V.,
6359,V.,
6360,VI.,VI.
6361,VI.,
6362,VI.,"O, what a face was hers to brighten light,"

6364,VI.,"To wile each moment with a fresh delight,"
6365,VI.,And part of memory's best contentment grow!
6366,VI.,"O, how her voice, as with an inmate's right,"
6367,VI.,"Into the strangest heart would welcome go,"
6368,VI.,"And make it sweet, and ready to become"
6369,VI.,Of white and gracious thoughts the chosen home!
6370,VI.,
6371,VI.,
6372,VII.,VII.
6373,VII.,
6374,VII.,None looked upon her but he straightway thought
6375,VII.,"Of all the greenest depths of country cheer,"
6376,VII.,And into each one's heart was freshly brought
6377,VII.,"What was to him the sweetest time of year,"
6378,VII.,So was her every look and motion fraught
6379,VII.,With out-of-door delights and forest lere:
6380,VII.,Not the first violet on a woodland lea
6381,VII.,Seemed a more visible gift of Spring than she.
6382,VII.,
6383,VII.,
6384,VIII.,VIII.
6385,VIII.,
6386,VIII.,Is love learned only out of poets' books?
6387,VIII.,"Is there not somewhat in the dropping flood,"
6388,VIII.,"And in the nunneries of silent nooks,"
6389,VIII.,"And in the murmured longing of the wood,"
6390,VIII.,"That could make Margaret dream of lovelorn looks,"
6391,VIII.,And stir a thrilling mystery in her blood
6392,VIII.,More trembly secret than Aurora's tear
6393,VIII.,Shed in the bosom of an eglatere?
6394,VIII.,
6395,VIII.,
6396,IX.,IX.
6397,IX.,
6398,IX.,"Full many a sweet forewarning hath the mind,"
6399,IX.,"Full many a whispering of vague desire,"
6400,IX.,Ere comes the nature destined to unbind
6401,IX.,"Its virgin zone, and all its deeps inspire,--"
6402,IX.,"Low stirrings in the leaves, before the wind"
6403,IX.,"Wakes all the green strings of the forest lyre,"
6404,IX.,"Faint heatings in the calyx, ere the rose"
6405,IX.,Its warm voluptuous breast doth all unclose.
6406,IX.,
6407,IX.,
6408,X.,X.
6409,X.,
6410,X.,"Long in its dim recesses pines the spirit,"
6411,X.,"Wildered and dark, despairingly alone;"
6412,X.,"Though many a shape of beauty wander near it,"
6413,X.,And many a wild and half-remembered tone
6414,X.,"Tremble from the divine abyss to cheer it,"
6415,X.,Yet still it knows that there is only one
6416,X.,"Before whom it can kneel and tribute bring,"
6417,X.,At once a happy vassal and a king.
6418,X.,
6419,X.,
6420,XI.,XI.
6421,XI.,
6422,XI.,"To feel a want, yet scarce know what it is,"
6423,XI.,"To seek one nature that is always new,"
6424,XI.,"Whose glance is warmer than another's kiss,"
6425,XI.,"Whom we can bare our inmost beauty to,"
6426,XI.,"Nor feel deserted afterwards,--for this"
6427,XI.,"But with our destined co-mate we can do,--"
6428,XI.,Such longing instinct fills the mighty scope
6429,XI.,Of the young soul with one mysterious hope.
6430,XI.,
6431,XI.,
6432,XII.,XII.
6433,XII.,
6434,XII.,So Margaret's heart grew brimming with the lore
6435,XII.,Of love's enticing secrets; and although
6436,XII.,"She had found none to cast it down before,"
6437,XII.,Yet oft to Fancy's chapel she would go
6438,XII.,"To pay her vows, and count the rosary o'er"
6439,XII.,Of her love's promised graces:--haply so
6440,XII.,Miranda's hope had pictured Ferdinand
6441,XII.,Long ere the gaunt wave tossed him on the strand.
6442,XII.,
6443,XII.,
6444,XIII.,XIII.
6445,XIII.,
6446,XIII.,"A new-made star that swims the lonely gloom,"
6447,XIII.,"Unwedded yet and longing for the sun,"
6448,XIII.,"Whose beams, the bride-gifts of the lavish groom"
6449,XIII.,"Blithely to crown the virgin planet run,"
6450,XIII.,"Her being was, watching to see the bloom"
6451,XIII.,Of love's fresh sunrise roofing one by one
6452,XIII.,"Its clouds with gold, a triumph-arch to be"
6453,XIII.,For him who came to hold her heart in fee.
6454,XIII.,
6455,XIII.,
6456,XIV.,XIV.
6457,XIV.,
6458,XIV.,Not far from Margaret's cottage dwelt a knight
6459,XIV.,"Of the proud Templars, a sworn celibate,"
6460,XIV.,Whose heart in secret fed upon the light
6461,XIV.,"And dew of her ripe beauty, through the grate"
6462,XIV.,Of his close vow catching what gleams he might
6463,XIV.,"Of the free heaven, and cursing--all too late--"
6464,XIV.,"The cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in,"
6465,XIV.,And turned life's crowning bliss to deadly sin.
6466,XIV.,
6467,XIV.,
6468,XV.,XV.
6469,XV.,
6470,XV.,"For he had met her in the wood by chance,"
6471,XV.,"And, having drunk her beauty's wildering spell,"
6472,XV.,His heart shook like the pennon of a lance
6473,XV.,"That quivers in a breeze's sudden swell,"
6474,XV.,"And thenceforth, in a close-enfolded trance,"
6475,XV.,From mistily golden deep to deep he fell;
6476,XV.,Till earth did waver and fade far away
6477,XV.,Beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay.
6478,XV.,
6479,XV.,
6480,XVI.,XVI.
6481,XVI.,
6482,XVI.,"A dark, proud man he was, whose half-blown youth"
6483,XVI.,"Had shed its blossoms even in opening,"
6484,XVI.,Leaving a few that with more winning ruth
6485,XVI.,"Trembling around grave manhood's stem might cling,"
6486,XVI.,"More sad than cheery, making, in good sooth,"
6487,XVI.,"Like the fringed gentian, a late autumn spring:--"
6488,XVI.,"A twilight nature, braided light and gloom,"
6489,XVI.,A youth half-smiling by an open tomb.
6490,XVI.,
6491,XVI.,
6492,XVII.,XVII.
6493,XVII.,
6494,XVII.,"Fair as an angel, who yet inly wore"
6495,XVII.,A wrinkled heart foreboding his near fall;
6496,XVII.,"Who saw him always wished to know him more,"
6497,XVII.,As if he were some fate's defiant thrall
6498,XVII.,And nursed a dreaded secret at its core;
6499,XVII.,"Little he loved, but power most of all,"
6500,XVII.,"And that he seemed to scorn, as one who knew"
6501,XVII.,By what foul paths men choose to crawl thereto.
6502,XVII.,
6503,XVII.,
6504,XVIII.,XVIII.
6505,XVIII.,
6506,XVIII.,"He had been noble, but some great deceit"
6507,XVIII.,Had turned his better instinct to a vice:
6508,XVIII.,"He strove to think the world was all a cheat,"
6509,XVIII.,"That power and fame were cheap at any price,"
6510,XVIII.,That the sure way of being shortly great
6511,XVIII.,"Was even to play life's game with loaded dice,"
6512,XVIII.,Since he had tried the honest play and found
6513,XVIII.,That vice and virtue differed but in sound.
6514,XVIII.,
6515,XVIII.,
6516,XIX.,XIX.
6517,XIX.,
6518,XIX.,Yet Margaret's sight redeemed him for a space
6519,XIX.,From his own thraldom; man could never be
6520,XIX.,A hypocrite when first such maiden grace
6521,XIX.,Smiled in upon his heart; the agony
6522,XIX.,Of wearing all day long a lying face
6523,XIX.,"Fell lightly from him, and, a moment free,"
6524,XIX.,Erect with wakened faith his spirit stood
6525,XIX.,And scorned the weakness of its demon-mood.
6526,XIX.,
6527,XIX.,
6528,XX.,XX.
6529,XX.,
6530,XX.,"Like a sweet wind-harp to him was her thought,"
6531,XX.,"Which would not let the common air come near,"
6532,XX.,Till from its dim enchantment it had caught
6533,XX.,A musical tenderness that brimmed his ear
6534,XX.,With sweetness more ethereal than aught
6535,XX.,Save silver-dropping snatches that whilere
6536,XX.,Rained down from some sad angel's faithful harp
6537,XX.,To cool her fallen lover's anguish sharp.
6538,XX.,
6539,XX.,
6540,XXI.,XXI.
6541,XXI.,
6542,XXI.,Deep in the forest was a little dell
6543,XXI.,High overarch√®d with the leafy sweep
6544,XXI.,"Of a broad oak, through whose gnarled roots there fell"
6545,XXI.,"A slender rill that sung itself asleep,"
6546,XXI.,Where its continuous toil had scooped a well
6547,XXI.,To please the fairy folk; breathlessly deep
6548,XXI.,"The stillness was, save when the dreaming brook"
6549,XXI.,From its small urn a drizzly murmur shook.
6550,XXI.,
6551,XXI.,

6553,XXII.,
6554,XXII.,The wooded hills sloped upward all around
6555,XXII.,"With gradual rise, and made an even rim,"
6556,XXII.,So that it seemed a mighty casque unbound
6557,XXII.,"From some huge Titan's brow to lighten him,"
6558,XXII.,"Ages ago, and left upon the ground,"
6559,XXII.,"Where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim,"
6560,XXII.,Till after countless centuries it grew
6561,XXII.,"Into this dell, the haunt of noontide dew."
6562,XXII.,
6563,XXII.,
6564,XXIII.,XXIII.
6565,XXIII.,
6566,XXIII.,"Dim vistas, sprinkled o'er with sun-flecked green,"

6568,XXIII.,"And, toward the west, in fancy might be seen"
6569,XXIII.,"A gothic window in its blazing pride,"
6570,XXIII.,"When the low sun, two arching elms between,"
6571,XXIII.,"Lit up the leaves beyond, which, autumn-dyed"
6572,XXIII.,"With lavish hues, would into splendor start,"

6578,XXIV.,"Here, leaning once against the old oak's trunk,"
6579,XXIV.,"Mordred, for such was the young Templar's name,"

6581,XXIV.,From the meek dove; sharp thrills of tingling flame
6582,XXIV.,"Made him forget that he was vowed a monk,"
6583,XXIV.,And all the outworks of his pride o'ercame:
6584,XXIV.,"Flooded he seemed with bright delicious pain,"

6586,XXIV.,
6587,XXIV.,
6588,XXV.,XXV.
6589,XXV.,
6590,XXV.,Such power hath beauty and frank innocence:
6591,XXV.,"A flower bloomed forth, that sunshine glad to bless,"
6592,XXV.,Even from his love's long leafless stem; the sense
6593,XXV.,"Of exile from Hope's happy realm grew less,"
6594,XXV.,"And thoughts of childish peace, he knew not whence,"
6595,XXV.,"Thronged round his heart with many an old caress,"
6596,XXV.,Melting the frost there into pearly dew
6597,XXV.,That mirrored back his nature's morning-blue.

6601,XXVI.,
6602,XXVI.,"She turned and saw him, but she felt no dread,"
6603,XXVI.,"Her purity, like adamantine mail,"
6604,XXVI.,Did so encircle her; and yet her head
6605,XXVI.,"She drooped, and made her golden hair her veil,"
6606,XXVI.,"Through which a glow of rosiest lustre spread,"
6607,XXVI.,"Then faded, and anon she stood all pale,"
6608,XXVI.,As snow o'er which a blush of northern-light
6609,XXVI.,"Suddenly reddens, and as soon grows white."
6610,XXVI.,
6611,XXVI.,
6612,XXVII.,XXVII.

6617,XXVII.,"Until there grew a mist before her sight,"
6618,XXVII.,"And where the present was she half forgot,"
6619,XXVII.,"Borne backward through the realms of old delight,--"
6620,XXVII.,"Then, starting up awake, she would have gone,"

6628,XXVIII.,"Thought-dazzling spot that set ablaze the blood,"
6629,XXVIII.,What need to tell? Fit language there is none
6630,XXVIII.,For the heart's deepest things. Who ever wooed
6631,XXVIII.,As in his boyish hope he would have done?
6632,XXVIII.,"For, when the soul is fullest, the hushed tongue"

6643,XXIX.,Found not some all unthought-of way to show

6790,VI.,"Of love, and faith too generous to defend"

6800,VII.,"Starved to more sinning by thy savage ban,--"
6801,VII.,Seeking that refuge because foulest vice
6802,VII.,"More god-like than thy virtue is, whose span"

6814,VIII.,"Unheeded, shivering in the pitiless air:"

6834,X.,"And winter frowned where spring had laughed before,"
6835,X.,"In his strange eyes, yet half her sadness doffed,"
6836,X.,And in her silent patience loved him more:
6837,X.,"Sorrow had made her soft heart yet more soft,"
6838,X.,And a new life within her own she bore
6839,X.,"Which made her tenderer, as she felt it move"

6847,XI.,Before its eyes the sullen tempest-rack
6848,XI.,"Would fade, and leave the face of heaven serene;"
6849,XI.,"And love's return doth more than fill the lack,"
6850,XI.,Which in his absence withered the heart's green;

6861,XII.,Such boding heavier on her bosom sate
6862,XII.,"One night, as, standing in the twilight gloam,"

6884,XIV.,And the quick blood doth curdle up and press
6885,XIV.,"About her heart, which seemed to shut its eyes"
6886,XIV.,"And hush itself, as who with shuddering guess"
6887,XIV.,Harks through the gloom and dreads e'en now to feel
6888,XIV.,Through his hot breast the icy slide of steel.

6898,XV.,"Night's starry heart yearning to hers doth seem,"

6907,XVI.,A tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss
6908,XVI.,"Rolls back through all her pulses suddenly,"
6909,XVI.,"As if some seraph, who had learned to kiss"

6919,XVII.,"If it should reach a brother Templar's ear,"
6920,XVII.,It haply might be made a good pretence
6921,XVII.,To cheat him of the hope he held most dear;
6922,XVII.,"For he had spared no thought's or deed's expense,"

6930,XVIII.,Is scarce less dreadful than remorse for crime;
6931,XVIII.,By no allurement can the soul be won
6932,XVIII.,From brooding o'er the weary creep of time:
6933,XVIII.,"Mordred stole forth into the happy sun,"
6934,XVIII.,"Striving to hum a scrap of Breton rhyme,"
6935,XVIII.,"But the sky struck him speechless, and he tried"

6944,XIX.,Weary because the stone face did not tell
6945,XIX.,"Of weariness, nor could he bear to-day,"
6946,XIX.,"Heartsick, to hear the patient sink and swell"

6956,XX.,But still there went a something at his side
6957,XX.,"That made the cool breeze hot, the sunshine dim;"
6958,XX.,"It would not flee, it could not be defied,"

6969,XXI.,"In happier season, for his heart well knows"
6970,XXI.,That he is sure to find poor Margaret
6971,XXI.,Watching and waiting there with lovelorn breast

6973,XXI.,
6974,XXI.,
6975,XXII.,XXII.
6976,XXII.,
6977,XXII.,Why follow here that grim old chronicle

6981,XXII.,"Smiling on him as Heaven smiles on Hell,"
6982,XXII.,"With a sad love, remembering when he stood"
6983,XXII.,"Not fallen yet, the unsealer of her heart,"

6992,XXIII.,"And then, to 'scape that suffocating air,"
6993,XXIII.,Like a scared ghoul out of the porch he slid;
6994,XXIII.,"But his strained eyes saw bloodspots everywhere,"
6995,XXIII.,And ghastly faces thrust themselves between
6996,XXIII.,His soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien.

6998,XXIII.,
6999,XXIV.,XXIV.
7000,XXIV.,
7001,XXIV.,"His heart went out within him, like a spark"

7005,XXIV.,Of her loose hair seemed in the cloudy dark
7006,XXIV.,"To spread a glory, and a thousandfold"
7007,XXIV.,More strangely pale and beautiful she grew:
7008,XXIV.,Her silence stabbed his conscience through and through:
7009,XXIV.,
7010,XXIV.,
7011,XXV.,XXV.
7012,XXV.,
7013,XXV.,"Or visions of past days,--a mother's eyes"

7015,XXV.,"Whose happy upturned face to hers replies,--"
7016,XXV.,He saw sometimes: or Margaret mournfully
7017,XXV.,"Gazed on him full of doubt, as one who tries"
7018,XXV.,To crush belief that does love injury;
7019,XXV.,"Then she would wring her hands, but soon again"

7021,XXV.,
7022,XXV.,
7023,XXVI.,XXVI.
7024,XXVI.,
7025,XXVI.,Meanwhile he dared not go and steal away
7026,XXVI.,"The silent, dead-cold witness of his sin;"
7027,XXVI.,"He had not feared the life, but that dull clay,"
7028,XXVI.,"Those open eyes that showed the death within,"
7029,XXVI.,Would surely stare him mad; yet all the day
7030,XXVI.,"A dreadful impulse, whence his will could win"
7031,XXVI.,"No refuge, made him linger in the aisle,"
7032,XXVI.,Freezing with his wan look each greeting smile.

7034,XXVI.,
7035,XXVII.,XXVII.
7036,XXVII.,
7037,XXVII.,"Now, on the second day there was to be"

7040,XXVII.,"And knights and dames with stately antique cheer,"
7041,XXVII.,"Blazing with pomp, as if all fa√´rie"
7042,XXVII.,"Had emptied her quaint halls, or, as it were,"
7043,XXVII.,"The illuminated marge of some old book,"

7045,XXVII.,
7046,XXVII.,
7047,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
7048,XXVIII.,
7049,XXVIII.,"When all were entered, and the roving eyes"

7051,XXVIII.,"Some on the priests, some on the traceries"
7052,XXVIII.,"That decked the slumber of a marble knight,"
7053,XXVIII.,And all the rustlings over that arise
7054,XXVIII.,"From recognizing tokens of delight,"
7055,XXVIII.,"When friendly glances meet,--then silent ease"
7056,XXVIII.,Spread o'er the multitude by slow degrees.
7057,XXVIII.,
7058,XXVIII.,
7059,XXIX.,XXIX.
7060,XXIX.,
7061,XXIX.,Then swelled the organ: up through choir and nave
7062,XXIX.,The music trembled with an inward thrill
7063,XXIX.,Of bliss at its own grandeur: wave on wave
7064,XXIX.,"Its flood of mellow thunder rose, until"
7065,XXIX.,"The hushed air shivered with the throb it gave,"
7066,XXIX.,"Then, poising for a moment, it stood still,"
7067,XXIX.,"And sank and rose again, to burst in spray"

7075,XXX.,"Until, in grand despair of what it dreamed,"
7076,XXX.,"In the agony of effort it doth break,"
7077,XXX.,Yet triumphs breaking; on it rushed and streamed
7078,XXX.,"And wantoned in its might, as when a lake,"
7079,XXX.,"Long pent among the mountains, bursts its walls"

7088,XXXI.,"And with its hoarse growl shakes the low-hung sky,"
7089,XXXI.,"It grew up like a darkness everywhere,"
7090,XXXI.,"Filling the vast cathedral;--suddenly,"

7100,XXXII.,Where fifty voices in one strand did twist
7101,XXXII.,"Their varicolored tones, and left no want"
7102,XXXII.,"To the delighted soul, which sank abyssed"

7107,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
7108,XXXIII.,
7109,XXXIII.,As if a lark should suddenly drop dead

7112,XXXIII.,Struck by a nameless fear that leapt along
7113,XXXIII.,"From heart to heart, and like a shadow spread"
7114,XXXIII.,"With instantaneous shiver through the throng,"
7115,XXXIII.,"So that some glanced behind, as half aware"

7130,XXXIV.,
7131,XXXV.,XXXV.

7139,XXXV.,The dreadful thing which all were sure would rise

7148,XXXVI.,"In all the church, so deep the stillness grew,"
7149,XXXVI.,"It seemed one might have heard it, as it went,"
7150,XXXVI.,"Give out an audible rustle, curling through"

7255,XLV.,"Beneath that mother's heart, whose instinct true"
7256,XLV.,Star-like had battled down the triple gloom
7257,XLV.,"Of sorrow, love, and death: young maidens, too,"
7258,XLV.,"Strewed the pale corpse with many a milkwhite bloom,"
7259,XLV.,"And parted the bright hair, and on the breast"
7260,XLV.,Crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest.

7265,XLVI.,"Some said, that, when the priest had sprinkled o'er"
7266,XLVI.,"The consecrated drops, they seemed to hear"
7267,XLVI.,"A sigh, as of some heart from travail sore"
7268,XLVI.,"Released, and then two voices singing clear,"
7269,XLVI.,"_Misereatur Deus_, more and more"
7270,XLVI.,"Fading far upward, and their ghastly fear"
7271,XLVI.,"Fell from them with that sound, as bodies fall"
7272,XLVI.,From souls upspringing to celestial hall.

7277,PROMETHEUS.,PROMETHEUS.
7278,PROMETHEUS.,
7279,PROMETHEUS.,
7280,PROMETHEUS.,"One after one the stars have risen and set,"
7281,PROMETHEUS.,Sparkling upon the hoarfrost on my chain:
7282,PROMETHEUS.,"The Bear, that prowled all night about the fold"
7283,PROMETHEUS.,"Of the North-star, hath shrunk into his den,"
7284,PROMETHEUS.,"Scared by the blithesome footsteps of the Dawn,"
7285,PROMETHEUS.,Whose blushing smile floods all the Orient;
7286,PROMETHEUS.,"And now bright Lucifer grows less and less,"
7287,PROMETHEUS.,Into the heaven's blue quiet deep-withdrawn.
7288,PROMETHEUS.,"Sunless and starless all, the desert sky"
7289,PROMETHEUS.,"Arches above me, empty as this heart"
7290,PROMETHEUS.,"For ages hath been empty of all joy,"
7291,PROMETHEUS.,"Except to brood upon its silent hope,"
7292,PROMETHEUS.,As o'er its hope of day the sky doth now.
7293,PROMETHEUS.,All night have I heard voices: deeper yet
7294,PROMETHEUS.,"The deep low breathing of the silence grew,"
7295,PROMETHEUS.,"While all about, muffled in awe, there stood"
7296,PROMETHEUS.,"Shadows, or forms, or both, clear-felt at heart,"
7297,PROMETHEUS.,"But, when I turned to front them, far along"
7298,PROMETHEUS.,"Only a shudder through the midnight ran,"
7299,PROMETHEUS.,And the dense stillness walled me closer round.
7300,PROMETHEUS.,But still I heard them wander up and down
7301,PROMETHEUS.,"That solitude, and flappings of dusk wings"
7302,PROMETHEUS.,"Did mingle with them, whether of those hags"
7303,PROMETHEUS.,"Let slip upon me once from Hades deep,"
7304,PROMETHEUS.,"Or of yet direr torments, if such be,"
7305,PROMETHEUS.,I could but guess; and then toward me came
7306,PROMETHEUS.,A shape as of a woman: very pale
7307,PROMETHEUS.,"It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move,"
7308,PROMETHEUS.,"And mine moved not, but only stared on them."
7309,PROMETHEUS.,"Their fixed awe went through my brain like ice,"
7310,PROMETHEUS.,"A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart,"
7311,PROMETHEUS.,"And a sharp chill, as if a dank night fog"
7312,PROMETHEUS.,"Suddenly closed me in, was all I felt:"
7313,PROMETHEUS.,"And then, methought, I heard a freezing sigh,"
7314,PROMETHEUS.,"A long, deep, shivering sigh, as from blue lips"
7315,PROMETHEUS.,"Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought"
7316,PROMETHEUS.,"Some doom was close upon me, and I looked"
7317,PROMETHEUS.,"And saw the red moon through the heavy mist,"
7318,PROMETHEUS.,"Just setting, and it seemed as if it were falling,"
7319,PROMETHEUS.,"Or reeling to its fall, so dim and dead"
7320,PROMETHEUS.,And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged
7321,PROMETHEUS.,"Into the rising surges of the pines,"
7322,PROMETHEUS.,"Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins"
7323,PROMETHEUS.,"Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength,"
7324,PROMETHEUS.,"Sent up a murmur in the morning wind,"
7325,PROMETHEUS.,Sad as the wail that from the populous earth
7326,PROMETHEUS.,"All day and night to high Olympus soars,"
7327,PROMETHEUS.,"Fit incense to thy wicked throne, O Jove!"
7328,PROMETHEUS.,
7329,PROMETHEUS.,Thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn
7330,PROMETHEUS.,"From off my lips, for I will tell thy doom."
7331,PROMETHEUS.,"And are these tears? Nay, do not triumph, Jove,"
7332,PROMETHEUS.,They are wrung from me but by the agonies
7333,PROMETHEUS.,"Of prophecy, like those sparse drops which fall"
7334,PROMETHEUS.,"From clouds in travail of the lightning, when"
7335,PROMETHEUS.,The great wave of the storm high-curled and black
7336,PROMETHEUS.,Rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break.
7337,PROMETHEUS.,"Why art thou made a god of, thou poor type"
7338,PROMETHEUS.,"Of anger, and revenge, and cunning force?"
7339,PROMETHEUS.,"True Power was never born of brutish Strength,"
7340,PROMETHEUS.,Nor sweet Truth suckled at the shaggy dugs
7341,PROMETHEUS.,"Of that old she-wolf. Are thy thunderbolts,"
7342,PROMETHEUS.,"That quell the darkness for a space, so strong"
7343,PROMETHEUS.,"As the prevailing patience of meek Light,"
7344,PROMETHEUS.,"Who, with the invincible tenderness of peace,"
7345,PROMETHEUS.,Wins it to be a portion of herself?
7346,PROMETHEUS.,"Why art thou made a god of, thou, who hast"
7347,PROMETHEUS.,"The never-sleeping terror at thy heart,"
7348,PROMETHEUS.,"That birthright of all tyrants, worse to bear"
7349,PROMETHEUS.,Than this thy ravening bird on which I smile?
7350,PROMETHEUS.,"Thou swear'st to free me, if I will unfold"
7351,PROMETHEUS.,What kind of doom it is whose omen flits
7352,PROMETHEUS.,"Across thy heart, as o'er a troop of doves"
7353,PROMETHEUS.,The fearful shadow of the kite. What need
7354,PROMETHEUS.,To know that truth whose knowledge cannot save?
7355,PROMETHEUS.,"Evil its errand hath, as well as Good;"
7356,PROMETHEUS.,"When thine is finished, thou art known no more:"
7357,PROMETHEUS.,"There is a higher purity than thou,"
7358,PROMETHEUS.,And higher purity is greater strength;
7359,PROMETHEUS.,"Thy nature is thy doom, at which thy heart"
7360,PROMETHEUS.,Trembles behind the thick wall of thy might.
7361,PROMETHEUS.,"Let man but hope, and thou art straightway chilled"
7362,PROMETHEUS.,With thought of that drear silence and deep night
7363,PROMETHEUS.,"Which, like a dream, shall swallow thee and thine:"
7364,PROMETHEUS.,"Let man but will, and thou art god no more,"
7365,PROMETHEUS.,More capable of ruin than the gold
7366,PROMETHEUS.,And ivory that image thee on earth.
7367,PROMETHEUS.,He who hurled down the monstrous Titan-brood
7368,PROMETHEUS.,"Blinded with lightnings, with rough thunders stunned,"
7369,PROMETHEUS.,Is weaker than a simple human thought.
7370,PROMETHEUS.,"My slender voice can shake thee, as the breeze,"
7371,PROMETHEUS.,"That seems but apt to stir a maiden's hair,"
7372,PROMETHEUS.,Sways huge Oceanus from pole to pole:
7373,PROMETHEUS.,"For I am still Prometheus, and foreknow"
7374,PROMETHEUS.,In my wise heart the end and doom of all.
7375,PROMETHEUS.,
7376,PROMETHEUS.,"Yes, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown"
7377,PROMETHEUS.,"By years of solitude,--that holds apart"
7378,PROMETHEUS.,"The past and future, giving the soul room"
7379,PROMETHEUS.,"To search into itself,--and long commune"
7380,PROMETHEUS.,"With this eternal silence;--more a god,"
7381,PROMETHEUS.,In my long-suffering and strength to meet
7382,PROMETHEUS.,"With equal front the direst shafts of fate,"
7383,PROMETHEUS.,"Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism,"
7384,PROMETHEUS.,Girt with thy baby-toys of force and wrath.
7385,PROMETHEUS.,"Yes, I am that Prometheus who brought down"
7386,PROMETHEUS.,"The light to man, which thou, in selfish fear,"
7387,PROMETHEUS.,"Hadst to thyself usurped,--his by sole right,"
7388,PROMETHEUS.,"For Man hath right to all save Tyranny,--"
7389,PROMETHEUS.,And which shall free him yet from thy frail throne.
7390,PROMETHEUS.,"Tyrants are but the spawn of Ignorance,"
7391,PROMETHEUS.,"Begotten by the slaves they trample on,"
7392,PROMETHEUS.,"Who, could they win a glimmer of the light,"
7393,PROMETHEUS.,"And see that Tyranny is always weakness,"
7394,PROMETHEUS.,"Or Fear with its own bosom ill at ease,"
7395,PROMETHEUS.,Would laugh away in scorn the sand-wove chain
7396,PROMETHEUS.,Which their own blindness feigned for adamant.
7397,PROMETHEUS.,"Wrong ever builds on quicksands, but the Right"
7398,PROMETHEUS.,To the firm centre lays its moveless base.
7399,PROMETHEUS.,"The tyrant trembles, if the air but stirs"
7400,PROMETHEUS.,"The innocent ringlets of a child's free hair,"
7401,PROMETHEUS.,"And crouches, when the thought of some great spirit,"
7402,PROMETHEUS.,"With world-wide murmur, like a rising gale,"
7403,PROMETHEUS.,"Over men's hearts, as over standing corn,"
7404,PROMETHEUS.,"Rushes, and bends them to its own strong will."
7405,PROMETHEUS.,"So shall some thought of mine yet circle earth,"
7406,PROMETHEUS.,"And puff away thy crumbling altars, Jove!"
7407,PROMETHEUS.,
7408,PROMETHEUS.,"And, wouldst thou know of my supreme revenge"
7409,PROMETHEUS.,"Poor tyrant, even now dethroned in heart,"
7410,PROMETHEUS.,"Realmless in soul, as tyrants ever are,"
7411,PROMETHEUS.,"Listen! and tell me if this bitter peak,"
7412,PROMETHEUS.,"This never-glutted vulture, and these chains"
7413,PROMETHEUS.,Shrink not before it; for it shall befit
7414,PROMETHEUS.,"A sorrow-taught, unconquered Titan-heart."
7415,PROMETHEUS.,"Men, when their death is on them, seem to stand"
7416,PROMETHEUS.,On a precipitous crag that overhangs
7417,PROMETHEUS.,"The abyss of doom, and in that depth to see,"
7418,PROMETHEUS.,"As in a glass, the features dim and vast"
7419,PROMETHEUS.,"Of things to come, the shadows, as it seems,"
7420,PROMETHEUS.,Of what have been. Death ever fronts the wise;
7421,PROMETHEUS.,"Not fearfully, but with clear promises"
7422,PROMETHEUS.,"Of larger life, on whose broad vans upborne,"
7423,PROMETHEUS.,"Their out-look widens, and they see beyond"
7424,PROMETHEUS.,"The horizon of the Present and the Past,"
7425,PROMETHEUS.,Even to the very source and end of things.
7426,PROMETHEUS.,Such am I now: immortal woe hath made
7427,PROMETHEUS.,"My heart a seer, and my soul a judge"
7428,PROMETHEUS.,Between the substance and the shadow of Truth.
7429,PROMETHEUS.,"The sure supremeness of the Beautiful,"
7430,PROMETHEUS.,By all the martyrdoms made doubly sure
7431,PROMETHEUS.,"Of such as I am, this is my revenge,"
7432,PROMETHEUS.,"Which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch,"
7433,PROMETHEUS.,Through which I see a sceptre and a throne.
7434,PROMETHEUS.,"The pipings of glad shepherds on the hills,"
7435,PROMETHEUS.,"Tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee,--"
7436,PROMETHEUS.,The songs of maidens pressing with white feet
7437,PROMETHEUS.,"The vintage on thine altars poured no more,--"
7438,PROMETHEUS.,"The murmurous bliss of lovers, underneath"
7439,PROMETHEUS.,"Dim grape-vine bowers, whose rosy bunches press"
7440,PROMETHEUS.,"Not half so closely their warm cheeks, unpaled"
7441,PROMETHEUS.,"By thoughts of thy brute lust,--the hive-like hum"
7442,PROMETHEUS.,"Of peaceful commonwealths, where sunburnt Toil"
7443,PROMETHEUS.,Reaps for itself the rich earth made its own
7444,PROMETHEUS.,"By its own labor, lightened with glad hymns"
7445,PROMETHEUS.,To an omnipotence which thy mad bolts
7446,PROMETHEUS.,"Would cope with as a spark with the vast sea,--"
7447,PROMETHEUS.,"Even the spirit of free love and peace,"
7448,PROMETHEUS.,"Duty's sure recompense through life and death,--"
7449,PROMETHEUS.,These are such harvests as all master-spirits
7450,PROMETHEUS.,"Reap, haply not on earth, but reap no less"
7451,PROMETHEUS.,Because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs;
7452,PROMETHEUS.,These are the bloodless daggers wherewithal
7453,PROMETHEUS.,"They stab fallen tyrants, this their high revenge:"
7454,PROMETHEUS.,"For their best part of life on earth is when,"
7455,PROMETHEUS.,"Long after death, prisoned and pent no more,"
7456,PROMETHEUS.,"Their thoughts, their wild dreams even, have become"
7457,PROMETHEUS.,Part of the necessary air men breathe;
7458,PROMETHEUS.,"When, like the moon, herself behind a cloud,"
7459,PROMETHEUS.,"They shed down light before us on life's sea,"
7460,PROMETHEUS.,That cheers us to steer onward still in hope.
7461,PROMETHEUS.,Earth with her twining memories ivies o'er
7462,PROMETHEUS.,"Their holy sepulchres; the chainless sea,"
7463,PROMETHEUS.,"In tempest or wide calm, repeats their thoughts;"
7464,PROMETHEUS.,"The lightning and the thunder, all free things,"
7465,PROMETHEUS.,Have legends of them for the ears of men.
7466,PROMETHEUS.,"All other glories are as falling stars,"
7467,PROMETHEUS.,But universal Nature watches theirs:
7468,PROMETHEUS.,Such strength is won by love of human kind.
7469,PROMETHEUS.,
7470,PROMETHEUS.,"Not that I feel that hunger after fame,"
7471,PROMETHEUS.,Which souls of a half-greatness are beset with;
7472,PROMETHEUS.,But that the memory of noble deeds
7473,PROMETHEUS.,"Cries, shame upon the idle and the vile,"
7474,PROMETHEUS.,And keeps the heart of Man forever up
7475,PROMETHEUS.,To the heroic level of old time.
7476,PROMETHEUS.,To be forgot at first is little pain
7477,PROMETHEUS.,To a heart conscious of such high intent
7478,PROMETHEUS.,As must be deathless on the lips of men;
7479,PROMETHEUS.,"But, having been a name, to sink and be"
7480,PROMETHEUS.,"A something which the world can do without,"
7481,PROMETHEUS.,"Which, having been or not, would never change"
7482,PROMETHEUS.,"The lightest pulse of fate,--this is indeed"
7483,PROMETHEUS.,"A cup of bitterness the worst to taste,"
7484,PROMETHEUS.,And this thy heart shall empty to the dregs.
7485,PROMETHEUS.,"Endless despair shall be thy Caucasus,"
7486,PROMETHEUS.,And memory thy vulture; thou wilt find
7487,PROMETHEUS.,"Oblivion far lonelier than this peak,--"
7488,PROMETHEUS.,Behold thy destiny! Thou think'st it much
7489,PROMETHEUS.,"That I should brave thee, miserable god!"
7490,PROMETHEUS.,"But I have braved a mightier than thou,"
7491,PROMETHEUS.,"Even the tempting of this soaring heart,"
7492,PROMETHEUS.,"Which might have made me, scarcely less than thou,"
7493,PROMETHEUS.,"A god among my brethren weak and blind,--"
7494,PROMETHEUS.,"Scarce less than thou, a pitiable thing"
7495,PROMETHEUS.,To be down-trodden into darkness soon.
7496,PROMETHEUS.,"But now I am above thee, for thou art"
7497,PROMETHEUS.,"The bungling workmanship of fear, the block"
7498,PROMETHEUS.,That awes the swart Barbarian; but I
7499,PROMETHEUS.,"Am what myself have made,--a nature wise"
7500,PROMETHEUS.,"With finding in itself the types of all,--"
7501,PROMETHEUS.,With watching from the dim verge of the time
7502,PROMETHEUS.,What things to be are visible in the gleams
7503,PROMETHEUS.,"Thrown forward on them from the luminous past,--"
7504,PROMETHEUS.,"Wise with the history of its own frail heart,"
7505,PROMETHEUS.,"With reverence and sorrow, and with love,"
7506,PROMETHEUS.,"Broad as the world, for freedom and for man."
7507,PROMETHEUS.,
7508,PROMETHEUS.,"Thou and all strength shall crumble, except Love,"
7509,PROMETHEUS.,"By whom and for whose glory, ye shall cease:"
7510,PROMETHEUS.,"And, when thou art but a dim moaning heard"
7511,PROMETHEUS.,"From out the pitiless glooms of Chaos, I"
7512,PROMETHEUS.,"Shall be a power and a memory,"
7513,PROMETHEUS.,"A name to fright all tyrants with, a light"
7514,PROMETHEUS.,"Unsetting as the pole-star, a great voice"
7515,PROMETHEUS.,Heard in the breathless pauses of the fight
7516,PROMETHEUS.,"By truth and freedom ever waged with wrong,"
7517,PROMETHEUS.,"Clear as a silver trumpet, to awake"
7518,PROMETHEUS.,Huge echoes that from age to age live on
7519,PROMETHEUS.,"In kindred spirits, giving them a sense"
7520,PROMETHEUS.,Of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung:
7521,PROMETHEUS.,And many a glazing eye shall smile to see
7522,PROMETHEUS.,"The memory of my triumph, (for to meet"
7523,PROMETHEUS.,"Wrong with endurance, and to overcome"
7524,PROMETHEUS.,"The present with a heart that looks beyond,"
7525,PROMETHEUS.,"Are triumph,) like a prophet eagle, perch"
7526,PROMETHEUS.,Upon the sacred banner of the Right.
7527,PROMETHEUS.,"Evil springs up, and flowers, and bears no seed,"
7528,PROMETHEUS.,"And feeds the green earth with its swift decay,"
7529,PROMETHEUS.,Leaving it richer for the growth of truth;
7530,PROMETHEUS.,"But Good, once put in action or in thought,"
7531,PROMETHEUS.,"Like a strong oak, doth from its boughs shed down"
7532,PROMETHEUS.,"The ripe germs of a forest. Thou; weak god,"
7533,PROMETHEUS.,"Shalt fade and be forgotten! but this soul,"
7534,PROMETHEUS.,"Fresh-living still in the serene abyss,"
7535,PROMETHEUS.,"In every heaving shall partake, that grows"
7536,PROMETHEUS.,"From heart to heart among the sons of men,--"
7537,PROMETHEUS.,As the ominous hum before the earthquake runs
7538,PROMETHEUS.,"Far through the √Ügean from roused isle to isle,--"
7539,PROMETHEUS.,"Foreboding wreck to palaces and shrines,"
7540,PROMETHEUS.,And mighty rents in many a cavernous error
7541,PROMETHEUS.,"That darkens the free light to man:--This heart,"
7542,PROMETHEUS.,"Unscarred by thy grim vulture, as the truth"
7543,PROMETHEUS.,Grows but more lovely 'neath the beaks and claws
7544,PROMETHEUS.,"Of Harpies blind that fain would soil it, shall"
7545,PROMETHEUS.,In all the throbbing exultations share
7546,PROMETHEUS.,"That wait on freedom's triumphs, and in all"
7547,PROMETHEUS.,"The glorious agonies of martyr-spirits,--"
7548,PROMETHEUS.,Sharp lightning-throes to split the jagged clouds
7549,PROMETHEUS.,"That veil the future, showing them the end,--"
7550,PROMETHEUS.,"Pain's thorny crown for constancy and truth,"
7551,PROMETHEUS.,Girding the temples like a wreath of stars.
7552,PROMETHEUS.,"This is a thought, that, like a fabled laurel,"
7553,PROMETHEUS.,Makes my faith thunder-proof; and thy dread bolts
7554,PROMETHEUS.,Fall on me like the silent flakes of snow
7555,PROMETHEUS.,On the hoar brows of aged Caucasus:
7556,PROMETHEUS.,"But, O thought far more blissful, they can rend"
7557,PROMETHEUS.,"This cloud of flesh, and make my soul a star!"
7558,PROMETHEUS.,
7559,PROMETHEUS.,"Unleash thy crouching thunders now, O Jove!"
7560,PROMETHEUS.,"Free this high heart, which, a poor captive long,"
7561,PROMETHEUS.,"Doth knock to be let forth, this heart which still,"
7562,PROMETHEUS.,"In its invincible manhood, overtops"
7563,PROMETHEUS.,"Thy puny godship, as this mountain doth"
7564,PROMETHEUS.,"The pines that moss its roots. O, even now,"
7565,PROMETHEUS.,"While from my peak of suffering I look down,"
7566,PROMETHEUS.,Beholding with a far-spread gush of hope
7567,PROMETHEUS.,"The sunrise of that Beauty, in whose face,"
7568,PROMETHEUS.,"Shone all around with love, no man shall look"
7569,PROMETHEUS.,But straightway like a god he is uplift
7570,PROMETHEUS.,"Unto the throne long empty for his sake,"
7571,PROMETHEUS.,And clearly oft foreshadowed in wide dreams
7572,PROMETHEUS.,"By his free inward nature, which nor thou,"
7573,PROMETHEUS.,"Nor any anarch after thee, can bind"
7574,PROMETHEUS.,"From working its great doom,--now, now set free"
7575,PROMETHEUS.,"This essence, not to die, but to become"
7576,PROMETHEUS.,Part of that awful Presence which doth haunt
7577,PROMETHEUS.,"The palaces of tyrants, to hunt off,"
7578,PROMETHEUS.,With its grim eyes and fearful whisperings
7579,PROMETHEUS.,"And hideous sense of utter loneliness,"
7580,PROMETHEUS.,"All hope of safety, all desire of peace,"
7581,PROMETHEUS.,"All but the loathed forefeeling of blank death,--"
7582,PROMETHEUS.,Part of that spirit which doth ever brood
7583,PROMETHEUS.,In patient calm on the unpilfered nest
7584,PROMETHEUS.,"Of man's deep heart, till mighty thoughts grow fledged"
7585,PROMETHEUS.,"To sail with darkening shadow o'er the world,"
7586,PROMETHEUS.,Filling with dread such souls as dare not trust
7587,PROMETHEUS.,"In the unfailing energy of Good,"
7588,PROMETHEUS.,"Until they swoop, and their pale quarry make"
7589,PROMETHEUS.,"Of some o'erbloated wrong,--that spirit which"
7590,PROMETHEUS.,"Scatters great hopes in the seed-field of man,"
7591,PROMETHEUS.,"Like acorns among grain, to grow and be"
7592,PROMETHEUS.,A roof for freedom in all coming time!
7593,PROMETHEUS.,
7594,PROMETHEUS.,"But no, this cannot be; for ages yet,"
7595,PROMETHEUS.,"In solitude unbroken, shall I hear"
7596,PROMETHEUS.,"The angry Caspian to the Euxine shout,"
7597,PROMETHEUS.,"And Euxine answer with a muffled roar,"
7598,PROMETHEUS.,On either side storming the giant walls
7599,PROMETHEUS.,"Of Caucasus with leagues of climbing foam,"
7600,PROMETHEUS.,"(Less, from my height, than flakes of downy snow,)"
7601,PROMETHEUS.,"That draw back baffled but to hurl again,"
7602,PROMETHEUS.,"Snatched up in wrath and horrible turmoil,"
7603,PROMETHEUS.,"Mountain on mountain, as the Titans erst,"
7604,PROMETHEUS.,"My brethren, scaling the high seat of Jove,"
7605,PROMETHEUS.,Heaved Pelion upon Ossa's shoulders broad
7606,PROMETHEUS.,In vain emprise. The moon will come and go
7607,PROMETHEUS.,With her monotonous vicissitude;
7608,PROMETHEUS.,"Once beautiful, when I was free to walk"
7609,PROMETHEUS.,"Among my fellows, and to interchange"
7610,PROMETHEUS.,"The influence benign of loving eyes,"
7611,PROMETHEUS.,But now by aged use grown wearisome;--
7612,PROMETHEUS.,False thought! most false! for how could I endure

8041,RHOECUS.,"God sends his teachers unto every age,"
8042,RHOECUS.,"To every clime, and every race of men,"
8043,RHOECUS.,With revelations fitted to their growth
8044,RHOECUS.,"And shape of mind, nor gives the realm of Truth"
8045,RHOECUS.,Into the selfish rule of one sole race:
8046,RHOECUS.,Therefore each form of worship that hath swayed
8047,RHOECUS.,"The life of man, and given it to grasp"
8048,RHOECUS.,"The master-key of knowledge, reverence,"
8049,RHOECUS.,Enfolds some germs of goodness and of right;
8050,RHOECUS.,"Else never had the eager soul, which loathes"
8051,RHOECUS.,"The slothful down of pampered ignorance,"
8052,RHOECUS.,Found in it even a moment's fitful rest.
8053,RHOECUS.,
8054,RHOECUS.,There is an instinct in the human heart
8055,RHOECUS.,"Which makes that all the fables it hath coined,"
8056,RHOECUS.,To justify the reign of its belief
8057,RHOECUS.,"And strengthen it by beauty's right divine,"
8058,RHOECUS.,"Veil in their inner cells a mystic gift,"
8059,RHOECUS.,"Which, like the hazel twig, in faithful hands,"
8060,RHOECUS.,Points surely to the hidden springs of truth.
8061,RHOECUS.,"For, as in nature naught is made in vain,"
8062,RHOECUS.,But all things have within their hull of use
8063,RHOECUS.,A wisdom and a meaning which may speak
8064,RHOECUS.,Of spiritual secrets to the ear
8065,RHOECUS.,"Of spirit; so, in whatsoe'er the heart"
8066,RHOECUS.,"Hath fashioned for a solace to itself,"
8067,RHOECUS.,"To make its inspirations suit its creed,"
8068,RHOECUS.,And from the niggard hands of falsehood wring
8069,RHOECUS.,"Its needful food of truth, there ever is"
8070,RHOECUS.,"A sympathy with Nature, which reveals,"
8071,RHOECUS.,"Not less than her own works, pure gleams of light"
8072,RHOECUS.,And earnest parables of inward lore.
8073,RHOECUS.,"Hear now this fairy legend of old Greece,"
8074,RHOECUS.,"As full of freedom, youth, and beauty still"
8075,RHOECUS.,As the immortal freshness of that grace
8076,RHOECUS.,Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze.
8077,RHOECUS.,
8078,RHOECUS.,"A youth named Rhoecus, wandering in the wood,"
8079,RHOECUS.,"Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall,"
8080,RHOECUS.,"And, feeling pity of so fair a tree,"
8081,RHOECUS.,"He propped its gray trunk with admiring care,"
8082,RHOECUS.,And with a thoughtless footstep loitered on.
8083,RHOECUS.,"But, as he turned, he heard a voice behind"
8084,RHOECUS.,"That murmured ""Rhoecus!"" 'Twas as if the leaves,"
8085,RHOECUS.,"Stirred by a passing breath, had murmured it,"
8086,RHOECUS.,"And, while he paused bewildered, yet again"
8087,RHOECUS.,"It murmured ""Rhoecus!"" softer than a breeze."
8088,RHOECUS.,He started and beheld with dizzy eyes
8089,RHOECUS.,What seemed the substance of a happy dream
8090,RHOECUS.,"Stand there before him, spreading a warm glow"
8091,RHOECUS.,Within the green glooms of the shadowy oak.
8092,RHOECUS.,"It seemed a woman's shape, yet all too fair"
8093,RHOECUS.,"To be a woman, and with eyes too meek"
8094,RHOECUS.,For any that were wont to mate with gods.
8095,RHOECUS.,"All naked like a goddess stood she there,"
8096,RHOECUS.,And like a goddess all too beautiful
8097,RHOECUS.,To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame.
8098,RHOECUS.,"""Rhoecus, I am the Dryad of this tree,"""
8099,RHOECUS.,"Thus she began, dropping her low-toned words"
8100,RHOECUS.,"Serene, and full, and clear, as drops of dew,"
8101,RHOECUS.,"""And with it I am doomed to live and die;"
8102,RHOECUS.,"The rain and sunshine are my caterers,"
8103,RHOECUS.,Nor have I other bliss than simple life;
8104,RHOECUS.,"Now ask me what thou wilt, that I can give,"
8105,RHOECUS.,"And with a thankful joy it shall be thine."""
8106,RHOECUS.,
8107,RHOECUS.,"Then Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart,"
8108,RHOECUS.,"Yet, by the prompting of such beauty, bold,"
8109,RHOECUS.,"Answered: ""What is there that can satisfy"
8110,RHOECUS.,The endless craving of the soul but love?
8111,RHOECUS.,"Give me thy love, or but the hope of that"
8112,RHOECUS.,"Which must be evermore my spirit's goal."""
8113,RHOECUS.,"After a little pause she said again,"
8114,RHOECUS.,"But with a glimpse of sadness in her tone,"
8115,RHOECUS.,"""I give it, Rhoecus, though a perilous gift;"
8116,RHOECUS.,"An hour before the sunset meet me here."""
8117,RHOECUS.,And straightway there was nothing he could see
8118,RHOECUS.,"But the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak,"
8119,RHOECUS.,And not a sound came to his straining ears
8120,RHOECUS.,"But the low trickling rustle of the leaves,"
8121,RHOECUS.,And far away upon an emerald slope
8122,RHOECUS.,The falter of an idle shepherd's pipe.
8123,RHOECUS.,
8124,RHOECUS.,"Now, in those days of simpleness and faith,"
8125,RHOECUS.,Men did not think that happy things were dreams
8126,RHOECUS.,Because they overstepped the narrow bourne
8127,RHOECUS.,"Of likelihood, but reverently deemed"
8128,RHOECUS.,Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful
8129,RHOECUS.,To be the guerdon of a daring heart.
8130,RHOECUS.,"So Rhoecus made no doubt that he was blest,"
8131,RHOECUS.,And all along unto the city's gate
8132,RHOECUS.,"Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked,"
8133,RHOECUS.,"The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont,"
8134,RHOECUS.,And he could scarce believe he had not wings
8135,RHOECUS.,Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins
8136,RHOECUS.,"Instead of blood, so light he felt and strange."
8137,RHOECUS.,
8138,RHOECUS.,"Young Rhoecus had a faithful heart enough,"
8139,RHOECUS.,"But one that in the present dwelt too much,"
8140,RHOECUS.,"And, taking with blithe welcome whatsoe'er"
8141,RHOECUS.,"Chance gave of joy, was wholly bound in that,"
8142,RHOECUS.,"Like the contented peasant of a vale,"
8143,RHOECUS.,"Deemed it the world, and never looked beyond."
8144,RHOECUS.,"So, haply meeting in the afternoon"
8145,RHOECUS.,Some comrades who were playing at the dice
8146,RHOECUS.,He joined them and forgot all else beside.
8147,RHOECUS.,
8148,RHOECUS.,"The dice were rattling at the merriest,"
8149,RHOECUS.,"And Rhoecus, who had met but sorry luck,"
8150,RHOECUS.,"Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw,"
8151,RHOECUS.,When through the room there hummed a yellow bee
8152,RHOECUS.,That buzzed about his ear with down-dropped legs
8153,RHOECUS.,"As if to light. And Rhoecus laughed and said,"
8154,RHOECUS.,"Feeling how red and flushed he was with loss,"
8155,RHOECUS.,"""By Venus! does he take me for a rose?"""
8156,RHOECUS.,"And brushed him off with rough, impatient hand."
8157,RHOECUS.,"But still the bee came back, and thrice again"
8158,RHOECUS.,Rhoecus did beat him off with growing wrath.
8159,RHOECUS.,"Then through the window flew the wounded bee,"
8160,RHOECUS.,"And Rhoecus, tracking him with angry eyes,"
8161,RHOECUS.,Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly
8162,RHOECUS.,"Against the red disc of the setting sun,--"
8163,RHOECUS.,"And instantly the blood sank from his heart,"
8164,RHOECUS.,As if its very walls had caved away.
8165,RHOECUS.,"Without a word he turned, and, rushing forth,"
8166,RHOECUS.,"Ran madly through the city and the gate,"
8167,RHOECUS.,"And o'er the plain, which now the wood's long shade,"
8168,RHOECUS.,"By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim,"
8169,RHOECUS.,Darkened wellnigh unto the city's wall.
8170,RHOECUS.,
8171,RHOECUS.,"Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree,"
8172,RHOECUS.,"And, listening fearfully, he heard once more"
8173,RHOECUS.,"The low voice murmur ""Rhoecus!"" close at hand:"
8174,RHOECUS.,"Whereat he looked around him, but could see"
8175,RHOECUS.,Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.
8176,RHOECUS.,"Then sighed the voice, ""Oh, Rhoecus! nevermore"
8177,RHOECUS.,"Shalt thou behold me or by day or night,"
8178,RHOECUS.,"Me, who would fain have blessed thee with a love"
8179,RHOECUS.,More ripe and bounteous than ever yet
8180,RHOECUS.,Filled up with nectar any mortal heart:
8181,RHOECUS.,"But thou didst scorn my humble messenger,"
8182,RHOECUS.,And sent'st him back to me with bruis√®d wings.
8183,RHOECUS.,We spirits only show to gentle eyes.
8184,RHOECUS.,"We ever ask an undivided love,"
8185,RHOECUS.,And he who scorns the least of Nature's works
8186,RHOECUS.,Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all.
8187,RHOECUS.,"Farewell! for thou canst never see me more."""
8188,RHOECUS.,
8189,RHOECUS.,"Then Rhoecus beat his breast, and groaned aloud"
8190,RHOECUS.,"And cried, ""Be pitiful! forgive me yet"
8191,RHOECUS.,"This once, and I shall never need it more!"""
8192,RHOECUS.,"""Alas!"" the voice returned, ""'t is thou art blind,"
8193,RHOECUS.,"Not I unmerciful; I can forgive,"
8194,RHOECUS.,But have no skill to heal thy spirit's eyes;
8195,RHOECUS.,"Only the soul hath power o'er itself."""
8196,RHOECUS.,"With that again there murmured ""Nevermore!"""
8197,RHOECUS.,"And Rhoecus after heard no other sound,"
8198,RHOECUS.,"Except the rattling of the oak's crisp leaves,"
8199,RHOECUS.,"Like the long surf upon a distant shore,"
8200,RHOECUS.,Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down.
8201,RHOECUS.,The night had gathered round him: o'er the plain
8202,RHOECUS.,"The city sparkled with its thousand lights,"
8203,RHOECUS.,And sounds of revel fell upon his ear
8204,RHOECUS.,"Harshly and like a curse; above, the sky,"
8205,RHOECUS.,"With all its bright sublimity of stars,"
8206,RHOECUS.,"Deepened, and on his forehead smote the breeze;"
8207,RHOECUS.,"Beauty was all around him and delight,"
8208,RHOECUS.,But from that eve he was alone on earth.

8800,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8801,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8802,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The old Chief, feeling now well-nigh his end,"
8803,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Called his two eldest children to his side,"
8804,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And gave them, in few words, his parting charge:--"
8805,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""My son and daughter, me ye see no more;"
8806,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The happy hunting-grounds await me, green"
8807,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],With change of spring and summer through the year:
8808,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But, for remembrance, after I am gone,"
8809,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Be kind to little Sheemah for my sake:
8810,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Weakling he is and young, and knows not yet"
8811,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"To set the trap, or draw the seasoned bow;"
8812,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Therefore of both your loves he hath more need,"
8813,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And he, who needeth love, to love hath right;"
8814,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"It is not like our furs and stores of corn,"
8815,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Whereto we claim sole title by our toil,"
8816,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But the Great Spirit plants it in our hearts,"
8817,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And waters it, and gives it sun, to be"
8818,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],The common stock and heritage of all:
8819,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Therefore be kind to Sheemah, that yourselves"
8820,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"May not be left deserted in your need."""
8821,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8822,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Alone, beside a lake, their wigwam stood,"
8823,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Far from the other dwellings of their tribe;
8824,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, after many moons, the loneliness"
8825,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Wearied the elder brother, and he said,"
8826,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""Why should I dwell here all alone, shut out"
8827,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"From the free, natural joys that fit my age?"
8828,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Lo, I am tall and strong, well skilled to hunt,"
8829,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Patient of toil and hunger, and not yet"
8830,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Have seen the danger which I dared not look
8831,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Full in the face; what hinders me to be
8832,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"A mighty Brave and Chief among my kin?"""
8833,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"So, taking up his arrows and his bow,"
8834,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"As if to hunt, he journeyed swiftly on,"
8835,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Until he gained the wigwams of his tribe,"
8836,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Where, choosing out a bride, he soon forgot,"
8837,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"In all the fret and bustle of new life,"
8838,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],The little Sheemah and his father's charge.
8839,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8840,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Now when the sister found her brother gone,"
8841,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And that, for many days, he came not back,"
8842,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],She wept for Sheemah more than for herself;
8843,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"For Love bides longest in a woman's heart,"
8844,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And flutters many times before he flies,"
8845,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And then doth perch so nearly, that a word"
8846,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"May lure him back, as swift and glad as light;"
8847,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],And Duty lingers even when Love is gone
8848,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Oft looking out in hope of his return;
8849,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, after Duty hath been driven forth,"
8850,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Then Selfishness creeps in the last of all,"
8851,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth,"
8852,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And crouching o'er the embers, to shut out"
8853,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Whatever paltry warmth and light are left,"
8854,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"With avaricious greed, from all beside."
8855,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"So, for long months, the sister hunted wide,"
8856,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],And cared for little Sheemah tenderly;
8857,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But, daily more and more, the loneliness"
8858,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Grew wearisome, and to herself she sighed,"
8859,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""Am I not fair? at least the glassy pool,"
8860,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"That hath no cause to flatter, tells me so;"
8861,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But, O, how flat and meaningless the tale,"
8862,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Unless it tremble on a lover's tongue!
8863,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Beauty hath no true glass, except it be"
8864,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"In the sweet privacy of loving eyes."""
8865,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Thus deemed she idly, and forgot the lore"
8866,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Which she had learned of nature and the woods,"
8867,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"That beauty's chief reward is to itself,"
8868,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],And that the eyes of Love reflect alone
8869,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The inward fairness, which is blurred and lost"
8870,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Unless kept clear and white by Duty's care
8871,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"So she went forth and sought the haunts of men,"
8872,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, being wedded, in her household cares,"
8873,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Soon, like the elder brother, quite forgot"
8874,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],The little Sheemah and her father's charge.
8875,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8876,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But Sheemah, left alone within the lodge,"
8877,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Waited and waited, with a shrinking heart,"
8878,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Thinking each rustle was his sister's step,"
8879,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Till hope grew less and less, and then went out,"
8880,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],And every sound was changed from hope to fear.
8881,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Few sounds there were:--the dropping of a nut,"
8882,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The squirrel's chirrup, and the jay's harsh scream,"
8883,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Autumn's sad remnants of blithe Summer's cheer,"
8884,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Heard at long intervals, seemed but to make"
8885,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],The dreadful void of silence silenter.
8886,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Soon what small store his sister left was gone,"
8887,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, through the Autumn, he made shift to live"
8888,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"On roots and berries, gathered in much fear"
8889,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Of wolves, whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes,"
8890,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Hollow and hungry, at the dead of night."
8891,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"But Winter came at last, and, when the snow,"
8892,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Thick-heaped for gleaming leagues o'er hill and plain,"
8893,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Spread its unbroken silence over all,"
8894,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Made bold by hunger, he was fain to glean,"
8895,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"(More sick at heart than Ruth, and all alone,)"
8896,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"After the harvest of the merciless wolf,"
8897,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Grim Boaz, who, sharp-ribbed and gaunt, yet feared"
8898,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],A thing more wild and starving than himself;
8899,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Till, by degrees, the wolf and he grew friends,"
8900,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And shared, together all the winter through."
8901,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],
8902,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Late in the Spring, when all the ice was gone,"
8903,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The elder brother, fishing in the lake,"
8904,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Upon whose edge his father's wigwam stood,"
8905,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],Heard a low moaning noise upon the shore:
8906,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Half like a child it seemed, half like a wolf,"
8907,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],And straightway there was something in his heart
8908,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"That said, ""It is thy brother Sheemah's voice."""
8909,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"So, paddling swiftly to the bank, he saw,"
8910,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Within a little thicket close at hand,"
8911,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"A child that seemed fast changing to a wolf,"
8912,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"From the neck downward, gray with shaggy hair"
8913,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],That still crept on and upward as he looked.
8914,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The face was turned away, but well he knew"
8915,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"That it was Sheemah's, even his brother's face."
8916,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes,"
8917,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And bowed his head, so that he might not see"
8918,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"The first look of his brother's eyes, and cried,"
8919,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""O, Sheemah! O, my brother, speak to me!"
8920,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Dost thou not know me, that I am thy brother?"
8921,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Come to me, little Sheemah, thou shalt dwell"
8922,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"With me henceforth, and know no care or want!"""
8923,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Sheemah was silent for a space, as if"
8924,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"'T were hard to summon up a human voice,"
8925,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, when he spake, the sound was of a wolf's:"
8926,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""I know thee not, nor art thou what thou say'st;"
8927,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"I have none other brethren than the wolves,"
8928,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, till thy heart be changed from what it is,"
8929,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Thou art not worthy to be called their kin."""
8930,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Then groaned the other, with a choking tongue,"
8931,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"""Alas! my heart is changed right bitterly;"
8932,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"'Tis shrunk and parched within me even now!"""
8933,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"And, looking upward fearfully, he saw"
8934,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Only a wolf that shrank away and ran,"
8935,A CHIPPEWA LEGEND.[A],"Ugly and fierce, to hide among the woods."

9103,COLUMBUS.,Hung round his neck by hands he knew not whose.
9104,COLUMBUS.,"A poor, vile thing and dross to all beside,"
9105,COLUMBUS.,Yet he therein can feel a virtue left
9106,COLUMBUS.,"By the sad pressure of a mother's hand,"
9107,COLUMBUS.,And unto him it still is tremulous
9108,COLUMBUS.,"With palpitating haste and wet with tears,"
9109,COLUMBUS.,"The key to him of hope and humanness,"
9110,COLUMBUS.,"The coarse shell of life's pearl, Expectancy."
9111,COLUMBUS.,"This hope hath been to me for love and fame,"
9112,COLUMBUS.,"Hath made me wholly lonely on the earth,"
9113,COLUMBUS.,"Building me up as in a thick-ribbed tower,"
9114,COLUMBUS.,"Wherewith enwalled my watching spirit burned,"
9115,COLUMBUS.,"Conquering its little island from the Dark,"
9116,COLUMBUS.,"Sole as a scholar's lamp, and heard men's steps,"
9117,COLUMBUS.,"In the far hurry of the outward world,"
9118,COLUMBUS.,"Pass dimly forth and back, sounds heard in dream"
9119,COLUMBUS.,As Ganymede by the eagle was snatched up
9120,COLUMBUS.,"From the gross sod to be Jove's cupbearer,"
9121,COLUMBUS.,So was I lifted by my great design:
9122,COLUMBUS.,"And who hath trod Olympus, from his eye"
9123,COLUMBUS.,Fades not that broader outlook of the gods;
9124,COLUMBUS.,"His life's low valleys overbrow earth's clouds,"
9125,COLUMBUS.,And that Olympian spectre of the past
9126,COLUMBUS.,"Looms towering up in sovereign memory,"
9127,COLUMBUS.,Beckoning his soul from meaner heights of doom.
9128,COLUMBUS.,"Had but the shadow of the Thunderer's bird,"
9129,COLUMBUS.,"Flashing athwart my spirit, made of me"
9130,COLUMBUS.,"A swift-betraying vision's Ganymede,"
9131,COLUMBUS.,Yet to have greatly dreamed precludes low ends
9132,COLUMBUS.,"Great days have ever such a morning-red,"
9133,COLUMBUS.,"On such a base great futures are built up,"
9134,COLUMBUS.,"And aspiration, though not put in act,"
9135,COLUMBUS.,"Comes back to ask its plighted troth again,"
9136,COLUMBUS.,Still watches round its grave the unlaid ghost
9137,COLUMBUS.,"Of a dead virtue, and makes other hopes,"
9138,COLUMBUS.,"Save that implacable one, seem thin and bleak"
9139,COLUMBUS.,"As shadows of bare trees upon the snow,"
9140,COLUMBUS.,Bound freezing there by the unpitying moon.
9141,COLUMBUS.,
9142,COLUMBUS.,"While other youths perplexed their mandolins,"
9143,COLUMBUS.,Praying that Thetis would her fingers twine
9144,COLUMBUS.,"In the loose glories of her lover's hair,"
9145,COLUMBUS.,"And wile another kiss to keep back day,"
9146,COLUMBUS.,"I, stretched beneath the many-centuried shade"
9147,COLUMBUS.,"Of some writhed oak, the wood's Laoco√∂n,"
9148,COLUMBUS.,"Did of my hope a dryad mistress make,"
9149,COLUMBUS.,"Whom I would woo to meet me privily,"
9150,COLUMBUS.,"Or underneath the stars, or when the moon"
9151,COLUMBUS.,Flecked all the forest floor with scattered pearls.
9152,COLUMBUS.,O days whose memory tames to fawning down
9153,COLUMBUS.,The surly fell of Ocean's bristled neck!
9154,COLUMBUS.,
9155,COLUMBUS.,"I know not when this hope enthralled me first,"
9156,COLUMBUS.,But from my boyhood up I loved to hear
9157,COLUMBUS.,The tall-pine-forests of the Apennine
9158,COLUMBUS.,"Murmur their hoary legends of the sea,"
9159,COLUMBUS.,"Which hearing, I in vision clear beheld;"
9160,COLUMBUS.,The sudden dark of tropic night shut down
9161,COLUMBUS.,"O'er the huge whisper of great watery wastes,"
9162,COLUMBUS.,The while a pair of herons trailingly
9163,COLUMBUS.,"Flapped inland, where some league-wide river hurled"
9164,COLUMBUS.,The yellow spoil of unconjectured realms
9165,COLUMBUS.,"Far through a gulf's green silence, never scarred"
9166,COLUMBUS.,By any but the Northwind's hurrying keels.
9167,COLUMBUS.,And not the pines alone; all sights and sounds
9168,COLUMBUS.,"To my world-seeking heart paid fealty,"
9169,COLUMBUS.,And catered for it as the Cretan bees
9170,COLUMBUS.,"Brought honey to the baby Jupiter,"
9171,COLUMBUS.,"Who in his soft hand crushed a violet,"
9172,COLUMBUS.,God-like foremusing the rough thunder's gripe;
9173,COLUMBUS.,"Then did I entertain the poet's song,"
9174,COLUMBUS.,"My great Idea's guest, and, passing o'er"
9175,COLUMBUS.,"That iron bridge the Tuscan built to hell,"
9176,COLUMBUS.,I heard Ulysses tell of mountain-chains
9177,COLUMBUS.,"Whose adamantine links, his manacles,"
9178,COLUMBUS.,"The western main shook growling, and still gnawed."
9179,COLUMBUS.,I brooded on the wise Athenian's tale
9180,COLUMBUS.,"Of happy Atlantis, and heard Bj√∂rne's keel"
9181,COLUMBUS.,Crunch the gray pebbles of the Vinland shore:
9182,COLUMBUS.,For I believed the poets; it is they
9183,COLUMBUS.,"Who utter wisdom from the central deep,"
9184,COLUMBUS.,"And, listening to the inner flow of things,"
9185,COLUMBUS.,Speak to the age out of eternity.
9186,COLUMBUS.,
9187,COLUMBUS.,Ah me! old hermits sought for solitude
9188,COLUMBUS.,"In caves and desert places of the earth,"
9189,COLUMBUS.,Where their own heart-beat was the only stir
9190,COLUMBUS.,Of living thing that comforted the year;
9191,COLUMBUS.,"But the bald pillar-top of Simeon,"
9192,COLUMBUS.,"In midnight's blankest waste, were populous,"
9193,COLUMBUS.,Matched with the isolation drear and deep
9194,COLUMBUS.,"Of him who pines among the swarm of men,"
9195,COLUMBUS.,"At once a new thought's king and prisoner,"
9196,COLUMBUS.,"Feeling the truer life within his life,"
9197,COLUMBUS.,"The fountain of his spirit's prophecy,"
9198,COLUMBUS.,"Sinking away and wasting, drop by drop,"
9199,COLUMBUS.,In the ungrateful sands of sceptic ears.
9200,COLUMBUS.,He in the palace-aisles of untrod woods
9201,COLUMBUS.,Doth walk a king; for him the pent-up cell
9202,COLUMBUS.,"Widens beyond the circles of the stars,"
9203,COLUMBUS.,And all the sceptred spirits of the past
9204,COLUMBUS.,Come thronging in to greet him as their peer;
9205,COLUMBUS.,But in the market-place's glare and throng
9206,COLUMBUS.,"He sits apart, an exile, and his brow"
9207,COLUMBUS.,Aches with the mocking memory of its crown.
9208,COLUMBUS.,But to the spirit select there is no choice;
9209,COLUMBUS.,"He cannot say, This will I do, or that,"
9210,COLUMBUS.,"For the cheap means putting Heaven's ends in pawn,"
9211,COLUMBUS.,"And bartering his bleak rocks, the freehold stern"
9212,COLUMBUS.,"Of destiny's first-born, for smoother fields"
9213,COLUMBUS.,That yield no crop of self-denying will;
9214,COLUMBUS.,"A hand is stretched to him from out the dark,"
9215,COLUMBUS.,"Which grasping without question, he is led"
9216,COLUMBUS.,Where there is work that he must do for God.
9217,COLUMBUS.,"The trial still is the strength's complement,"
9218,COLUMBUS.,"And the uncertain, dizzy path that scales"
9219,COLUMBUS.,The sheer heights of supremest purposes
9220,COLUMBUS.,Is steeper to the angel than the child.
9221,COLUMBUS.,"Chances have laws as fixed as planets have,"
9222,COLUMBUS.,"And disappointment's dry and bitter root,"
9223,COLUMBUS.,"Envy's harsh berries, and the choking pool"
9224,COLUMBUS.,"Of the world's scorn, are the right mother-milk"
9225,COLUMBUS.,"To the tough hearts that pioneer their kind,"
9226,COLUMBUS.,And break a pathway to those unknown realms
9227,COLUMBUS.,That in the earth's broad shadow lie enthralled;
9228,COLUMBUS.,"Endurance is the crowning quality,"
9229,COLUMBUS.,And patience all the passion of great hearts;
9230,COLUMBUS.,"These are their stay, and when the leaden world"
9231,COLUMBUS.,"Sets its hard face against their fateful thought,"
9232,COLUMBUS.,"And brute strength, like a scornful conqueror,"
9233,COLUMBUS.,"Clangs his huge mace down in the other scale,"
9234,COLUMBUS.,"The inspired soul but flings his patience in,"
9235,COLUMBUS.,"And slowly that outweighs the ponderous globe,--"
9236,COLUMBUS.,"One faith against a whole earth's unbelief,"
9237,COLUMBUS.,One soul against the flesh of all mankind.
9238,COLUMBUS.,
9239,COLUMBUS.,Thus ever seems it when my soul can hear
9240,COLUMBUS.,"The voice that errs not; then my triumph gleams,"
9241,COLUMBUS.,"O'er the blank ocean beckoning, and all night"
9242,COLUMBUS.,My heart flies on before me as I sail;
9243,COLUMBUS.,"Far on I see my lifelong enterprise,"
9244,COLUMBUS.,Which rose like Ganges mid the freezing snows
9245,COLUMBUS.,"Of a world's sordidness, sweep broadening down,"
9246,COLUMBUS.,"And, gathering to itself a thousand streams,"
9247,COLUMBUS.,Grow sacred ere it mingle with the sea;
9248,COLUMBUS.,"I see the ungated wall of chaos old,"
9249,COLUMBUS.,"With blocks Cyclopean hewn of solid night,"
9250,COLUMBUS.,Fade like a wreath of unreturning mist
9251,COLUMBUS.,Before the irreversible feet of light;--
9252,COLUMBUS.,"And lo, with what clear omen in the east"
9253,COLUMBUS.,"On day's gray threshold stands the eager dawn,"
9254,COLUMBUS.,Like young Leander rosy from the sea
9255,COLUMBUS.,Glowing at Hero's lattice!
9256,COLUMBUS.,
9257,COLUMBUS.,One day more
9258,COLUMBUS.,These muttering shoalbrains leave the helm to me.
9259,COLUMBUS.,"God, let me not in their dull ooze be stranded;"
9260,COLUMBUS.,"Let not this one frail bark, to hollow which"
9261,COLUMBUS.,I have dug out the pith and sinewy heart
9262,COLUMBUS.,"Of my aspiring life's fair trunk, be so"
9263,COLUMBUS.,"Cast up to warp and blacken in the sun,"
9264,COLUMBUS.,Just as the opposing wind 'gins whistle off
9265,COLUMBUS.,"His cheek-swollen mates, and from the leaning mast"
9266,COLUMBUS.,Fortune's full sail strains forward!
9267,COLUMBUS.,One poor day!--
9268,COLUMBUS.,Remember whose and not how short it is!
9269,COLUMBUS.,"It is God's day, it is Columbus's."
9270,COLUMBUS.,"A lavish day! One day, with life and heart,"

9291,AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG.,"It seemed a wondrous freak of chance, so perfect, yet so rough,"

9343,THE SOWER.,"With shrivelled hands he flung his seed,"
9344,THE SOWER.,Nor ever turned to look behind;
9345,THE SOWER.,Of sight or sound he took no heed;

9347,THE SOWER.,
9348,THE SOWER.,"His dim face showed no soul beneath,"
9349,THE SOWER.,"Yet in my heart I felt a stir,"

9352,THE SOWER.,
9353,THE SOWER.,"I heard, as still the seed he cast,"

9888,THE SEARCH.,"My Thebes, cut deep with many a solemn rift,"
9889,THE SEARCH.,But epitaphed her own sepulchred state:
9890,THE SEARCH.,"Then I remembered whom I went to seek,"
9891,THE SEARCH.,And blessed blunt Winter for his counsel bleak.
9892,THE SEARCH.,
9893,THE SEARCH.,"Back to the world I turned,"
9894,THE SEARCH.,"For Christ, I said, is king;"
9895,THE SEARCH.,"So the cramped alley and the hut I spurned,"
9896,THE SEARCH.,As far beneath his sojourning:
9897,THE SEARCH.,"Mid power and wealth I sought,"
9898,THE SEARCH.,"But found no trace of him,"
9899,THE SEARCH.,And all the costly offerings I had brought
9900,THE SEARCH.,With sudden rust and mould grew dim:
9901,THE SEARCH.,"I found his tomb, indeed, where, by their laws,"
9902,THE SEARCH.,"All must on stated days themselves imprison,"
9903,THE SEARCH.,"Mocking with bread a dead creed's grinning jaws,"
9904,THE SEARCH.,Witless how long the life had thence arisen;
9905,THE SEARCH.,"Due sacrifice to this they set apart,"
9906,THE SEARCH.,Prizing it more than Christ's own living heart.
9907,THE SEARCH.,
9908,THE SEARCH.,So from my feet the dust
9909,THE SEARCH.,Of the proud World I shook;
9910,THE SEARCH.,"Then came dear Love and shared with me his crust,"
9911,THE SEARCH.,And half my sorrow's burden took.
9912,THE SEARCH.,"After the World's soft bed,"
9913,THE SEARCH.,"Its rich and dainty fare,"
9914,THE SEARCH.,"Like down seemed Love's coarse pillow to my head,"
9915,THE SEARCH.,His cheap food seemed as manna rare;
9916,THE SEARCH.,"Fresh-trodden prints of bare and bleeding feet,"
9917,THE SEARCH.,"Turned to the heedless city whence I came,"
9918,THE SEARCH.,"Hard by I saw, and springs of worship sweet"
9919,THE SEARCH.,Gushed from my cleft heart smitten by the same;
9920,THE SEARCH.,"Love looked me in the face and spake no words,"
9921,THE SEARCH.,But straight I knew those foot-prints were the Lord's.
9922,THE SEARCH.,
9923,THE SEARCH.,I followed where they led
9924,THE SEARCH.,"And in a hovel rude,"
9925,THE SEARCH.,"With naught to fence the weather from his head,"
9926,THE SEARCH.,The King I sought for meekly stood
9927,THE SEARCH.,"A naked, hungry child"
9928,THE SEARCH.,"Clung round his gracious knee,"
9929,THE SEARCH.,And a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled
9930,THE SEARCH.,To bless the smile that set him free;
9931,THE SEARCH.,"New miracles I saw his presence do,--"
9932,THE SEARCH.,"No more I knew the hovel bare and poor,"
9933,THE SEARCH.,"The gathered chips into a woodpile grew,"
9934,THE SEARCH.,The broken morsel swelled to goodly store;
9935,THE SEARCH.,"I knelt and wept: my Christ no more I seek,"
9936,THE SEARCH.,His throne is with the outcast and the weak.

10290,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh,"
10291,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Relieves the distant with her cooler sky,"
10292,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes."
10293,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
10294,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"There gleams my native village, dear to me,"
10295,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Though higher change's waves each day are seen,"
10296,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Whelming fields famed in boyhood's history,"
10297,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Sanding with houses the diminished green;
10298,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"There, in red brick, which softening time defies,"
10299,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Stand square and stiff the Muses' factories;--
10300,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,How with my life knit up is every well-known scene!
10301,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
10302,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Flow on, dear river! not alone you flow"

10304,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Fed from the mystic springs of long-ago,"
10305,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Your twin flows silent through my world of mind:

10314,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Where dust and mud the equal year divide,"
10315,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"There gentle Allston lived, and wrought, and died,"

10318,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"_Virgilium vidi tantum_,--I have seen"

10320,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"That misty hair, that fine Undine-like mien,"
10321,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Tremulous as down to feeling's faintest call;--
10322,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Ah, dear old homestead! count it to thy fame"
10323,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,That thither many times the Painter came;--
10324,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"One elm yet bears his name, a feathery tree and tall."
10325,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
10326,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Swiftly the present fades in memory's glow,--"
10327,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Our only sure possession is the past;
10328,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The village blacksmith died a month ago,"
10329,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,And dim to me the forge's roaring blast;
10330,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Soon fire-new medi√¶vals we shall see
10331,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Oust the black smithy from its chestnut tree,"
10332,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"And that hewn down, perhaps, the beehive green and vast."
10333,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
10334,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"How many times, prouder than king on throne,"
10335,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Loosed from the village school-dame's A's and B's,"
10336,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Panting have I the creaky bellows blown,"
10337,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"And watched the pent volcano's red increase,"
10338,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Then paused to see the ponderous sledge, brought down"
10339,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"By that hard arm voluminous and brown,"
10340,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,From the white iron swarm its golden vanishing bees.
10341,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
10342,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Dear native town! whose choking elms each year

10350,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"So palpable, I've seen those unshorn few,"

10369,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Something of kindred more than sympathy;
10370,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,For in thy bounds I reverently laid away

10403,A FRAGMENT.,"A stem that a tower might rest upon,"

10410,A FRAGMENT.,"Till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor,"
10411,A FRAGMENT.,Hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore
10412,A FRAGMENT.,"Of Vinland, perhaps, while their prow groped its way"
10413,A FRAGMENT.,'Twixt the frothy gnashed tusks of some ship-crunching bay.
10414,A FRAGMENT.,
10415,A FRAGMENT.,"So, pine-like, the legend grew, strong-limbed and tall,"

10430,A FRAGMENT.,
10431,A FRAGMENT.,"Yes, the pine is the mother of legends; what food"

10459,A FRAGMENT.,Where the lumberers sit by the log-fires which throw
10460,A FRAGMENT.,"Their own threatening shadows far round o'er the snow,"
10461,A FRAGMENT.,"When the wolf howls aloof, and the wavering glare"

10685,AMBROSE.,
10686,AMBROSE.,Through earnest prayer and watchings long

10739,AMBROSE.,"Six vases of crystal then he took,"

12837,DARA.,"How he rendered the mould of elder days,"
12838,DARA.,To Dara gave a satrapy in trust.
12839,DARA.,
12840,DARA.,"So Dara shepherded a province wide,"
12841,DARA.,Nor in his viceroy's sceptre took more pride

12856,DARA.,"Went guarded, and no other eye had seen"
12857,DARA.,"What was therein, save only Dara's own,"
12858,DARA.,"Yet, when 'twas opened, all his tent was known"

12860,DARA.,
12861,DARA.,"The king set forth for Dara's province straight,"
12862,DARA.,"Where, as was fit, outside his city's gate"
12863,DARA.,The viceroy met him with a stately train;
12864,DARA.,"And there, with archers circled, close at hand,"
12865,DARA.,"A camel with the chest was seen to stand,"
12866,DARA.,"The king grew red, for thus the guilt was plain."
12867,DARA.,
12868,DARA.,"""Open me now,"" he cried, ""yon treasure-chest!"""
12869,DARA.,"'Twas done, and only a worn shepherd's vest"

12871,DARA.,Not Dara; open as the sky's blue roof
12872,DARA.,"He stood, and ""O, my lord, behold the proof"

12874,DARA.,
12875,DARA.,"""For ruling men, lo! all the charm I had;"
12876,DARA.,"My soul, in those coarse vestments ever clad,"
12877,DARA.,"Still to the unstained past kept true and leal,"

12881,DARA.,

16771,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"second works of authors, short sentences commendatory of the first,"
16772,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"under the title of _Notices of the Press_. These, I have been given to"
16773,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"understand, are procurable at certain established rates, payment being"
16774,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher, or by an"
16775,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author. Considering
16776,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"these things with myself, and also that such notices are neither"
16777,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"intended, nor generally believed, to convey any real opinions, being a"
16778,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature, and resembling"
16779,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas, I conceived"
16780,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number
16781,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"of such myself, but also more immediately subservient to the end in view"
16782,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than await the
16783,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"contingency of a second, when they would seem to be of small utility. To"
16784,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"delay attaching the _bobs_ until the second attempt at flying the kite,"
16785,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art. Neither has
16786,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"it escaped my notice, nor failed to afford me matter of reflection,"
16787,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"that, when a circus or a caravan is about to visit Jaalam, the initial"
16788,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance

16790,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"sufficiently gazed at, and beginning to lose their attractiveness except"
16791,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"for the flies, and, truly, the boys also, (in whom I find it impossible"
16792,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"to repress, even during school-hours, certain oral and telegraphic"
16793,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"communications concerning the expected show,) upon some fine morning the"
16794,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"band enters in a gayly-painted wagon, or triumphal chariot, and with"
16795,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"noisy advertisement, by means of brass, wood, and sheepskin, makes the"

16797,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"draw nearer and nearer, do I desiderate those eyes of Aristarchus,"

16799,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"vain regret of wasted opportunities, the advantage of a pancratic or"
16800,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"pantechnic education, since he is most reverenced by my little subjects"
16801,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the

16803,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"credible to me, (albeit confirmed by the Hameliners dating their legal"

16805,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"without pretence of magical potency, bewitch the pupillary legs, nor"
16806,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"leave to the pedagogic an entire self-control. For these reasons, lest"
16807,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution, I prorogue my restless"
16808,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"commons, whom I also follow into the street, chiefly lest some mischief"

16821,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"three hundred years of age, though I recollected no existing instance of"
16822,NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.,"such antediluvian longevity. Nevertheless, I afterwards discovered the"

17301,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,
17302,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"It will not have escaped the attentive eye, that I have, on the"
17303,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"title-page, omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name"
17304,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"which not only add greatly to the value of every book, but whet and"
17305,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,exacerbate the appetite of the reader. For not only does he surmise that
17306,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a
17307,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of
17308,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"such decorations, but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an"
17309,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the
17310,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"reputation of such bodies as the _S. Archoel. Dahom._, or the _Acad."
17311,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,Lit. et Scient. Kamtschat._ I cannot but think that the early editions
17312,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,of Shakspeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general
17313,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"acceptance, but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages; and"
17314,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"I believe, that, even now, a publisher of the works of either of those"
17315,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their
17316,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent,--a"
17317,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment
17318,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"against Socrates, when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond"
17319,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"the reach of antidotes, and when his memory had acquired a deserved"
17320,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,respectability. I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of
17321,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style himself ""Gent."" on the"
17322,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"title-page of his Essay, as who should say to his readers that they"
17323,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman.
17324,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,
17325,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"Nevertheless, finding that, without descending to a smaller size of type"
17326,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several
17327,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"societies to be named, I could not compress my intended list within the"
17328,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"limits of a single page, and thinking, moreover, that the act would"
17329,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"carry with it an air of decorous modesty, I have chosen to take the"
17330,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"reader aside, as it were, into my private closet, and there not only"
17331,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"exhibit to him the diplomas which I already possess, but also to furnish"
17332,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"him with a prophetic vision of those which I may, without undue"
17333,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"presumption, hope for, as not beyond the reach of human ambition and"
17334,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"attainment. And I am the rather induced to this from the fact, that my"
17335,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of
17336,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,our beloved _Alma Mater_. Whether this is to be attributed to the
17337,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,difficulty of Latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts (with a complete
17338,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,list of which I took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year
17339,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"beforehand), or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives,"
17340,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"I forbear to consider in this place, the matter being in course of"
17341,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"painful investigation. But, however this may be, I felt the omission the"
17342,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"more keenly, as I had, in expectation of the new catalogue, enriched the"
17343,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"library of the Jaalam Athen√¶um with the old one then in my possession,"
17344,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a
17345,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,never-wearying winter evening's amusement in looking out the name of
17346,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,their parent in that distinguished roll. Those harmless innocents had at
17347,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"least committed no--but I forbear, having intrusted my reflections and"
17348,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,animadversions on this painful topic to the safe-keeping of my private
17349,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"diary, intended for posthumous publication. I state this fact here, in"
17350,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"order that certain nameless individuals, who are, perhaps, overmuch"
17351,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"congratulating themselves on my silence, may know that a rod is in"
17352,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply
17353,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,to their memories.
17354,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,
17355,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"The careful reader will note, that, in the list which I have prepared, I"
17356,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies to which a
17357,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature. I have
17358,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"ventured to do this, not only to encourage native ambition and genius,"
17359,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,but also because I have never been able to perceive in what way distance
17360,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,(unless we suppose them at the end of a lever) could increase the weight
17361,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,of learned bodies. As far as I have been able to extend my researches
17362,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach America, I have"
17363,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,discovered no generic difference between the antipodal _Fogrum
17364,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,Japonicum_ and the _F. Americanum_ sufficiently common in our own
17365,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"immediate neighborhood. Yet, with a becoming deference to the popular"
17366,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every
17367,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"additional mile they travel, I have intermixed the names of some"
17368,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest.
17369,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,
17370,NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE.,"I add here, also, an advertisement, which, that it may be the more"

17412,INTRODUCTION.,
17413,INTRODUCTION.,"When, more than three years ago, my talented young parishioner, Mr."
17414,INTRODUCTION.,"Biglow, came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his"
17415,INTRODUCTION.,poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city
17416,INTRODUCTION.,"newspaper, it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that"
17417,INTRODUCTION.,"his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume, and ushered"
17418,INTRODUCTION.,into the august presence of the reading public by myself. So little are
17419,INTRODUCTION.,we short-sighted mortals able to predict the event! I confess that there
17420,INTRODUCTION.,is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated (though only as
17421,INTRODUCTION.,sleeping partner) in a book which can stand by itself in an independent
17422,INTRODUCTION.,unity on the shelves of libraries. For there is always this drawback
17423,INTRODUCTION.,"from the pleasure of printing a sermon, that, whereas the queasy stomach"
17424,INTRODUCTION.,of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a
17425,INTRODUCTION.,"separate volume, those religious and godly-minded children (those"
17426,INTRODUCTION.,"Samuels, if I may call them so) of the brain must at first lie buried in"
17427,INTRODUCTION.,"an undistinguished heap, and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed"
17428,INTRODUCTION.,"to them, mummy-wrapt with a score of others in a cheap binding, with no"
17429,INTRODUCTION.,"other mark of distinction than the word ""_Miscellaneous_"" printed upon"
17430,INTRODUCTION.,the back. Far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected
17431,INTRODUCTION.,popularity which I am pleased to find these bucolic strains have
17432,INTRODUCTION.,"attained unto. If I know myself, I am measurably free from the itch of"
17433,INTRODUCTION.,vanity; yet I may be allowed to say that I was not backward to recognize
17434,INTRODUCTION.,"in them a certain wild, puckery, acidulous (sometimes even verging"
17435,INTRODUCTION.,"toward that point which, in our rustic phrase, is termed _shut-eye_)"
17436,INTRODUCTION.,"flavor, not wholly unpleasing, nor unwholesome, to palates cloyed with"
17437,INTRODUCTION.,"the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit. It may be, also, that some"
17438,INTRODUCTION.,"touches of my own, here and there, may have led to their wider"
17439,INTRODUCTION.,"acceptance, albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and"
17440,INTRODUCTION.,authorship.[J]
17441,INTRODUCTION.,
17442,INTRODUCTION.,[Footnote J: The reader curious in such matters may refer
17443,INTRODUCTION.,"(if he can find them) to ""A Sermon preached on the"

17447,INTRODUCTION.,"the late Experience Tidd, Esq.,"" &c., &c.]"
17448,INTRODUCTION.,
17449,INTRODUCTION.,"I was, at first, inclined to discourage Mr. Biglow's attempts, as"
17450,INTRODUCTION.,knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally
17451,INTRODUCTION.,"incident to adolescence, which, if the fitting remedies be not at once"
17452,INTRODUCTION.,"and with a bold hand applied, may become chronic, and render one, who"
17453,INTRODUCTION.,"might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle, a"
17454,INTRODUCTION.,"painful object even to nearest friends and relatives. But thinking, on a"
17455,INTRODUCTION.,"further experience, that there was a germ of promise in him which"
17456,INTRODUCTION.,"required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from around it, I"
17457,INTRODUCTION.,thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of English
17458,INTRODUCTION.,"composition in verse, and leave the rest to natural emulation. With this"
17459,INTRODUCTION.,"view, I accordingly lent him some volumes of Pope and Goldsmith, to the"
17460,INTRODUCTION.,assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings. Not long
17461,INTRODUCTION.,"afterward, he brought me some verses written upon that model, a specimen"
17462,INTRODUCTION.,"of which I subjoin, having changed some phrases of less elegancy, and a"
17463,INTRODUCTION.,few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear. The poem consisted of
17464,INTRODUCTION.,"childish reminiscences, and the sketches which follow will not seem"
17465,INTRODUCTION.,destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country
17466,INTRODUCTION.,"village. And, first, let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the"

17577,INTRODUCTION.,
17578,INTRODUCTION.,I do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own
17579,INTRODUCTION.,"rather than Mr. Biglow's, as, indeed, he maintained stoutly that my file"
17580,INTRODUCTION.,"had left nothing of his in them. I should not, perhaps, have felt"
17581,INTRODUCTION.,"entitled to take so great liberties with them, had I not more than"
17582,INTRODUCTION.,"suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself, a very near ancestor"
17583,INTRODUCTION.,having written a Latin poem in the Harvard _Gratulatio_ on the accession
17584,INTRODUCTION.,"of George the Third. Suffice it to say, that, whether not satisfied with"
17585,INTRODUCTION.,"such limited approbation as I could conscientiously bestow, or from a"
17586,INTRODUCTION.,"sense of natural inaptitude, certain it is that my young friend could"
17587,INTRODUCTION.,never be induced to any further essays in this kind. He affirmed that it
17588,INTRODUCTION.,"was to him like writing in a foreign tongue,--that Mr. Pope's"
17589,INTRODUCTION.,"versification was like the regular ticking of one of Willard's clocks,"
17590,INTRODUCTION.,"in which one could fancy, after long listening, a certain kind of rhythm"
17591,INTRODUCTION.,"or tune, but which yet was only a poverty-stricken _tick, tick_, after"
17592,INTRODUCTION.,"all,--and that he had never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so"
17593,INTRODUCTION.,"fairly, or in forms so pleasing to his eye, as a fox-grape over a"
17594,INTRODUCTION.,"scrub-oak in a swamp. He added I know not what, to the effect that the"
17595,INTRODUCTION.,sweet-water would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves
17596,INTRODUCTION.,"starched and ironed out, and that Pegsus (so he called him) hardly"
17597,INTRODUCTION.,looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers. These and other such
17598,INTRODUCTION.,"opinions I did not long strive to eradicate, attributing them rather to"
17599,INTRODUCTION.,a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with
17600,INTRODUCTION.,"purely natural objects, than to a perverted moral sense. I was the more"
17601,INTRODUCTION.,"inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek,"
17602,INTRODUCTION.,"that his verses, wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and"
17603,INTRODUCTION.,"point, had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner."
17604,INTRODUCTION.,"So, only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name"
17605,INTRODUCTION.,"Pegasus, I left him to follow the bent of his natural genius."
17606,INTRODUCTION.,
17607,INTRODUCTION.,Yet could I not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan
17608,INTRODUCTION.,"(which, literally interpreted, signifies village) muse without yet a"
17609,INTRODUCTION.,"further effort for his conversion, and to this end I resolved that"
17610,INTRODUCTION.,"whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself, aided by the assiduous"
17611,INTRODUCTION.,"bellows of correct models, should be put in requisition. Accordingly,"
17612,INTRODUCTION.,when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses
17613,INTRODUCTION.,which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting
17614,INTRODUCTION.,"from the Mexican war, and the folly of leaving the question of slavery"
17615,INTRODUCTION.,"or freedom to the adjudication of chance, I did myself indite a short"
17616,INTRODUCTION.,"fable or apologue after the manner of Gay and Prior, to the end that he"
17617,INTRODUCTION.,might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of
17618,INTRODUCTION.,a more refined style and more elegant expression. Mr. Biglow's

18017,*.* TO THE INDULGENT READER.,"for _as_, _thet_ for _that_, and again giving it the broad sound it has"

18474,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,[This letter of Mr. Sawin's was not originally written in
18475,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"verse. Mr. Biglow, thinking it peculiarly susceptible of"
18476,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"metrical adornment, translated it, so to speak, into his own"
18477,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,vernacular tongue. This is not the time to consider the
18478,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"question, whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to"
18479,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,the human race. If leisure from other and more important
18480,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"avocations be granted, I will handle the matter more at"
18481,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,large in an appendix to the present volume. In this place I
18482,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"will barely remark, that I have sometimes noticed in the"
18483,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for
18484,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"alliteration, assonance, and even rhyme, in which natural"
18485,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which
18486,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,our Anglo-Saxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry
18487,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,of Pope. I would not be understood as questioning in these
18488,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"remarks that pious theory which supposes that children, if"
18489,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"left entirely to themselves, would naturally discourse in"
18490,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"Hebrew. For this the authority of one experiment is claimed,"
18491,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"and I could, with Sir Thomas Browne, desire its"
18492,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"establishment, inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred"
18493,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,tongue would thereby be facilitated. I am aware that
18494,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,Herodotus states the conclusion of Psammeticus to have been
18495,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"in favor of a dialect of the Phrygian. But, beside the"
18496,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be
18497,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"blessed to a Pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity,"
18498,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,we have on the Hebrew side the comparatively recent
18499,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,investigation of James the Fourth of Scotland. I will add to
18500,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"this prefatory remark, that Mr. Sawin, though a native of"
18501,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"Jaalam, has never been a stated attendant on the religious"
18502,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,exercises of my congregation. I consider my humble efforts
18503,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the
18504,MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.,"wolf's clothing of war, save for the comparatively innocent"

18999,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"approaches to so fair a model, and all they are verily"
19000,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this
19001,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"their original intendment. When, therefore, one would have"
19002,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitude,--""_Our"
19003,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"country, however bounded!_"" he demands of us that we"
19004,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"sacrifice the larger to the less, the higher to the lower,"
19005,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of
19006,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of Truth. Our true
19007,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"country is bounded on the north and the south, on the east"
19008,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"and the west, by Justice, and when she oversteps that"
19009,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair's-breadth, she"
19010,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"ceases to be our mother, and chooses rather to be looked"
19011,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"upon _quasi noverca_. That is a hard choice, when our"
19012,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and
19013,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,our duty points us to another. We must make as noble and
19014,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,becoming an election as did Penelope between Icarius and
19015,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"Ulysses. Veiling our faces, we must take silently the hand"

19077,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"of many years' standing. In the ploughing season, no one has"

19091,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"that my young friend's shot has struck the lintel, for the"
19092,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,Post is shaken (Amos ix. 1). The editor of that paper is a

19095,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"absent in Mexico, he has left his journal in some less"
19096,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"judicious hands. At any rate, the Post has been too swift on"
19097,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,this occasion. It could hardly have cited a more
19098,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has
19099,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"selected for animadversion, namely,--"
19100,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,
19101,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,'We kind o' thought Christ went agin war an' pillage.'
19102,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,
19103,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"""If the Post maintains the converse of this proposition, it"

19107,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"is a sign in London on which is painted,--'The Green Man.'"
19108,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,It would do very well as a portrait of any individual who
19109,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,would support so unscriptural a thesis. As regards the
19110,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"language of the line in question, I am bold to say that He"
19111,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect
19112,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,unseemly which conveys a sound and pious sentiment. I could
19113,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"wish that such sentiments were more common, however"
19114,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"uncouthly expressed. Saint Ambrose affirms, that _veritas a"
19115,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"quocunque_ (why not, then, _quomodocunque_?) _dicatur, a"
19116,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,spiritu sancto est_. Digest also this of Baxter:--'The

19119,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,
19120,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"""When the paragraph in question was shown to Mr. Biglow, the"
19121,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction
19122,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"was that which classed him with the Whig party. He says,"
19123,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"that, if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet, that"
19124,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition;
19125,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own
19126,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,baking than he could have conceived to be possible without
19127,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,repletion. He has been for some years past (I regret to say)
19128,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective
19129,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of
19130,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"that party. I confess, that, in some discussions which I"
19131,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"have had with him on this point in my study, he has"
19132,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,displayed a vein of obstinacy which I had not hitherto
19133,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,detected in his composition. He is also (_horresco
19134,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,referens_) infected in no small measure with the peculiar
19135,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"notions of a print called the Liberator, whose heresies I"
19136,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"take every proper opportunity of combating, and of which, I"

19138,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,
19139,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"""I did not see Mr. B.'s verses until they appeared in print,"
19140,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,and there is certainly one thing in them which I consider
19141,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,highly improper. I allude to the personal references to
19142,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,myself by name. To confer notoriety on an humble individual
19143,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"who is laboring quietly in his vocation, and who keeps his"
19144,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena
19145,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"(though _v√¶ mihi si non evangelizavero_), is no doubt an"
19146,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,indecorum. The sentiments which he attributes to me I will
19147,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"not deny to be mine. They were embodied, though in a"
19148,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"different form, in a discourse preached upon the last day of"
19149,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"public fasting, and were acceptable to my entire people (of"
19150,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"whatever political views), except the postmaster, who"
19151,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,dissented _ex officio_. I observe that you sometimes devote
19152,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,a portion of your paper to a religious summary. I should be
19153,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion
19154,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,in this department of your instructive journal. By omitting
19155,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"the advertisements, it might easily be got within the limits"
19156,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"of a single number, and I venture to insure you the sale of"
19157,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,some scores of copies in this town. I will cheerfully render
19158,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,myself responsible for ten. It might possibly be
19159,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,advantageous to issue it as an _extra_. But perhaps you will
19160,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"not esteem it an object, and I will not press it. My offer"
19161,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in
19162,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,print; for I can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by
19163,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"turning to the Triennial Catalogue of the University, where"
19164,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,it also possesses that added emphasis of Italics with which

19193,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,
19194,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,I have in the foregoing letter mentioned General Scott in
19195,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"connection with the Presidency, because I have been given to"
19196,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused
19197,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,to be destroyed more Mexicans than any other commander. His
19198,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,claim would therefore be deservedly considered the
19199,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"strongest. Until accurate returns of the Mexicans killed,"
19200,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"wounded, and maimed be obtained, it will be difficult to"
19201,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,settle these nice points of precedence. Should it prove that
19202,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive
19203,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"than General S., and has thereby rendered himself more"
19204,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative
19205,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"portion of our community, I shall cheerfully insert his"
19206,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"name, instead of that of General S., in a future edition. It"
19207,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"may be thought, likewise, that General S. has invalidated"
19208,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,his claims by too much attention to the decencies of
19209,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"apparel, and the habits belonging to a gentleman. These"
19210,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope. I
19211,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,wonder not that successful military achievement should
19212,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,attract the admiration of the multitude. Rather do I rejoice
19213,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing
19214,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,its hold upon the popular mind. It is related of Thomas
19215,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"Warton, the second of that honored name who held the office"
19216,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"of Poetry Professor at Oxford, that, when one wished to find"
19217,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"him, being absconded, as was his wont, in some obscure"
19218,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"alehouse, he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum"
19219,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"and fife, the sound of which inspiring music would be sure"
19220,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,to draw the Doctor from his retirement into the street. We
19221,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity.
19222,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,_Nescio qu√¢ dulcedine ... cunctos ducit._ I confess to some

19225,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"saddle under the severe fire of the training-field, and when"
19226,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"I remember that some military enthusiasts, through haste,"
19227,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"inexperience, or an over-desire to lend reality to those"
19228,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"fictitious combats, will sometimes discharge their ramrods,"
19229,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"I cannot but admire, while I deplore, the mistaken devotion"
19230,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,of those heroic officers. _Semel insanivimus omnes._ I was
19231,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"myself, during the late war with Great Britain, chaplain of"
19232,WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.,"a regiment, which was fortunately never called to active"

20169,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"""Wonderful, to him that has eyes to see it rightly, is the"

20172,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"my weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre, or"
20173,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"rather of a puppet-show, on whose stage, narrow as it is,"
20174,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"the tragedy, comedy, and farce of life are played in little."
20175,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,Behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a

20181,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,famous performers from the four quarters of the globe.
20182,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"Looked at from a point of criticism, tiny puppets they seem"
20183,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"all, as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and"
20184,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,officiates as showman. Now I can truly see how little and
20185,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,transitory is life. The earth appears almost as a drop of
20186,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"vinegar, on which the solar microscope of the imagination"
20187,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,must be brought to bear in order to make out anything
20188,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"distinctly. That animalcule there, in the pea-jacket, is"
20189,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"Louis Philippe, just landed on the coast of England. That"
20190,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"other, in the gray surtout and cocked hat, is Napoleon"
20191,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"Bonaparte Smith, assuring France that she need apprehend no"
20192,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,interference from him in the present alarming juncture. At
20193,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"that spot, where you seem to see a speck of something in"
20194,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"motion, is an immense mass-meeting. Look sharper and you"
20195,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited
20196,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"manner. That is the great Mr. Soandso, defining his position"
20197,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers. That infinitesimal
20198,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"creature, upon whom some score of others, as minute as he,"
20199,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"are gazing in open-mouthed admiration, is a famous"
20200,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"philosopher, expounding to a select audience their capacity"
20201,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,for the infinite. That scarce discernible pufflet of smoke
20202,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"and dust is a revolution. That speck there is a reformer,"
20203,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world.
20204,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"And lo, there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that"
20205,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"blows one breath between its grinning teeth, and all our"
20206,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into
20207,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,the dark Beyond.

20209,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"""Yes, the little show-box has its solemner suggestions. Now"
20210,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man, who lays down"
20211,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,a scythe and hour-glass in the corner while he shifts the
20212,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"scenes. There, too, in the dim background, a weird shape is"
20213,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"ever delving. Sometimes he leans upon his mattock, and"
20214,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"gazes, as a coach whirls by, bearing the newly married on"
20215,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"their wedding jaunt, or glances carelessly at a babe brought"
20216,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,home from christening. Suddenly (for the scene grows larger
20217,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,and larger as we look) a bony hand snatches back a performer
20218,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"in the midst of his part, and him, whom yesterday two"
20219,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"infinites (past and future) would not suffice, a handful of"
20220,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"dust is enough to cover and silence forever. Nay, we see the"
20221,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman
20222,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"himself, and guess, not without a shudder, that they are"
20223,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,lying in wait for spectator also.
20224,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,
20225,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"""Think of it: for three dollars a year I buy a season-ticket"
20226,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"to this great Globe Theatre, for which God would write the"
20227,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"dramas (only that we like farces, spectacles, and the"
20228,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"tragedies of Apollyon better), whose scene-shifter is Time,"
20229,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,and whose curtain is rung down by Death.

20231,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"""Such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as I am tearing"
20232,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,off the wrapper of my newspaper. Then suddenly that
20233,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me
20234,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"with a strange kind of awe. Look! deaths and marriages,"
20235,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"notices of inventions, discoveries, and books, lists of"
20236,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"promotions, of killed, wounded, and missing, news of fires,"

20239,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"along which tremble the joys, sorrows, wrongs, triumphs,"

20241,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from
20242,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"mankind as a spectator of their puppet-pranks, another"
20243,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"supervenes, in which I feel that I, too, unknown and unheard"
20244,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"of, am yet of some import to my fellows. For, through my"
20245,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"newspaper here, do not families take pains to send me, an"
20246,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"entire stranger, news of a death among them? Are not here"

20248,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"of all, is not this singular person anxious to have me"
20249,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,informed that he has received a fresh supply of Dimitry
20250,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,Bruisgins? But to none of us does the President continue
20251,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,miraculous (even if for a moment discerned as such). We
20252,THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.,"glance carelessly at the sunrise, and get used to Orion and"

20495,P. S.,"election, may safely enough be called a republic of letters."
20496,P. S.,"Epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic, which"
20497,P. S.,"seizes one candidate after another, not seldom cutting short"
20498,P. S.,"the thread of political life. It has come to such a pass,"
20499,P. S.,that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents than a
20500,P. S.,"letter from its candidate. _Litera scripta manet_, and it"
20501,P. S.,will go hard if something bad can not be made of it. General
20502,P. S.,"Harrison, it is well understood, was surrounded, during his"
20503,P. S.,"candidacy, with the _cordon sanitaire_ of a vigilance"
20504,P. S.,committee. No prisoner in Spielberg was ever more cautiously
20505,P. S.,deprived of writing materials. The soot was scraped
20506,P. S.,carefully from the chimney-places; outposts of expert
20507,P. S.,rifle-shooters rendered it sure death for any goose (who
20508,P. S.,came clad in feathers) to approach within a certain limited
20509,P. S.,distance of North Bend; and all domestic fowls about the
20510,P. S.,premises were reduced to the condition of Plato's original
20511,P. S.,man. By these precautions the General was saved. _Parva
20512,P. S.,"componere magnis_, I remember, that, when party-spirit once"
20513,P. S.,"ran high among my people, upon occasion of the choice of a"
20514,P. S.,"new deacon, I, having my preferences, yet not caring too"
20515,P. S.,"openly to express them, made use of an innocent fraud to"
20516,P. S.,bring about that result which I deemed most desirable. My
20517,P. S.,stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the
20518,P. S.,Complete Letter-Writer in the way of the candidate whom I
20519,P. S.,"wished to defeat. He caught the infection, and addressed a"
20520,P. S.,"short note to his constituents, in which the opposite party"
20521,P. S.,"detected so many and so grave improprieties, (he had"
20522,P. S.,modelled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a
20523,P. S.,"proposal of marriage,) that he not only lost his election,"
20524,P. S.,"but, falling under a suspicion of Sabellianism and I know"
20525,P. S.,"not what, (the widow Endive assured me that he was a"
20526,P. S.,"Paralipomenon, to her certain knowledge,) was forced to"
20527,P. S.,leave the town. Thus it is that the letter killeth.

20529,P. S.,The object which candidates propose to themselves in writing
20530,P. S.,is to convey no meaning at all. And here is a quite
20531,P. S.,unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge
20532,P. S.,headlong. For it is precisely in such cryptographies that
20533,P. S.,mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount
20534,P. S.,and variety of significance. _Omne ignotum pro mirifico._
20535,P. S.,How do we admire at the antique world striving to crack
20536,P. S.,"those oracular nuts from Delphi, Hammon, and elsewhere, in"
20537,P. S.,only one of which can I so much as surmise that any kernel
20538,P. S.,"had ever lodged; that, namely, wherein Apollo confessed that"
20539,P. S.,"he was mortal. One Didymus is, moreover, related to have"
20540,P. S.,"written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar,"
20541,P. S.,a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his
20542,P. S.,"successors, and which seems still to possess an attraction"
20543,P. S.,for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it. A
20544,P. S.,"singular loadstone for theologians, also, is the Beast in"
20545,P. S.,"the Apocalypse, whereof, in the course of my studies, I have"
20546,P. S.,"noted two hundred and three several interpretations, each"
20547,P. S.,lethiferal to all the rest. _Non nostrum est tantas
20548,P. S.,"componere lites_, yet I have myself ventured upon a two"
20549,P. S.,"hundred and fourth, which I embodied in a discourse preached"
20550,P. S.,"on occasion of the demise of the late usurper, Napoleon"
20551,P. S.,"Bonaparte, and which quieted, in a large measure, the minds"
20552,P. S.,of my people. It is true that my views on this important
20553,P. S.,"point were ardently controverted by Mr. Shearjashub Holden,"
20554,P. S.,"the then preceptor of our academy, and in other particulars"
20555,P. S.,"a very deserving and sensible young man, though possessing a"
20556,P. S.,somewhat limited knowledge of the Greek tongue. But his
20557,P. S.,"heresy struck down no deep root, and, he having been lately"
20558,P. S.,"removed by the hand of Providence, I had the satisfaction of"
20559,P. S.,reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached
20560,P. S.,upon the Lord's day immediately succeeding his funeral. This
20561,P. S.,"might seem like taking an unfair advantage, did I not add"
20562,P. S.,that he had made provision in his last will (being celibate)
20563,P. S.,for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of
20564,P. S.,his own dangerous opinions.
20565,P. S.,
20566,P. S.,I know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so
20567,P. S.,nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a Presidential
20568,P. S.,"candidate. Now, among the Greeks, the eating of beans was"
20569,P. S.,strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult
20570,P. S.,"those expert amphibologists, and this same prohibition on"
20571,P. S.,the part of Pythagoras to his disciples is understood to
20572,P. S.,"imply an abstinence from politics, beans having been used as"
20573,P. S.,"ballots. That other explication, _quod videlicet sensus eo"
20574,P. S.,"cibo obtundi existimaret_, though supported _pugnis et"
20575,P. S.,"calcibus_ by many of the learned, and not wanting the"
20576,P. S.,"countenance of Cicero, is confuted by the larger experience"
20577,P. S.,"of New England. On the whole, I think it safer to apply here"
20578,P. S.,the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in
20579,P. S.,"regard to antique cosmogonies, myths, fables, proverbial"
20580,P. S.,"expressions, and knotty points generally, which is, to find"
20581,P. S.,"a common-sense meaning, and then select whatever can be"
20582,P. S.,imagined the most opposite thereto. In this way we arrive at
20583,P. S.,"the conclusion, that the Greeks objected to the questioning"
20584,P. S.,"of candidates. And very properly, if, as I conceive, the"
20585,P. S.,chief point be not to discover what a person in that
20586,P. S.,"position is, or what he will do, but whether he can be"
20587,P. S.,"elected. _Vos exemplaria Gr√¶ca nocturna versate manu,"
20588,P. S.,versate diurna._
20589,P. S.,
20590,P. S.,"But, since an imitation of the Greeks in this particular"
20591,P. S.,(the asking of questions being one chief privilege of
20592,P. S.,"freemen) is hardly to be hoped for, and our candidates will"
20593,P. S.,"answer, whether they are questioned or not, I would"
20594,P. S.,recommend that these ante-electionary dialogues should be
20595,P. S.,"carried on by symbols, as were the diplomatic"
20596,P. S.,"correspondences of the Scythians and Macrobii, or confined"
20597,P. S.,"to the language of signs, like the famous interview of"
20598,P. S.,Panurge and Goatsnose. A candidate might then convey a
20599,P. S.,suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one
20600,P. S.,"eye, or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness"
20601,P. S.,to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies.
20602,P. S.,These answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective
20603,P. S.,construction the exigencies of the political campaign might
20604,P. S.,"seem to demand, and the candidate could take his position on"
20605,P. S.,"either side of the fence with entire consistency. Or, if"
20606,P. S.,"letters must be written, profitable use might be made of the"
20607,P. S.,"Dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script, every"

20914,E. E.,
20915,E. E.,It would appear that Mr. Sawin found the actual feast
20916,E. E.,curiously the reverse of the bill of fare advertised in
20917,E. E.,Faneuil Hall and other places. His primary object seems to
20918,E. E.,have been the making of his fortune. _Qu√¶renda pecunia
20919,E. E.,"primum, virtus post nummos._ He hoisted sail for Eldorado,"
20920,E. E.,and shipwrecked on Point Tribulation. _Quid non mortalia
20921,E. E.,"pectora cogis, auri sacra fames?_ The speculation has"
20922,E. E.,"sometimes crossed my mind, in that dreary interval of"
20923,E. E.,drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary
20924,E. E.,"showers, that Providence, by the creation of a money-tree,"
20925,E. E.,might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing
20926,E. E.,"problem of human life. We read of bread-trees, the butter"
20927,E. E.,for which lies ready-churned in Irish bogs. Milk-trees we
20928,E. E.,"are assured of in South America, and stout Sir John Hawkins"
20929,E. E.,testifies to water-trees in the Canaries. Boot-trees bear
20930,E. E.,"abundantly in Lynn and elsewhere; and I have seen, in the"
20931,E. E.,"entries of the wealthy, hat-trees with a fair show of fruit."
20932,E. E.,"A family-tree I once cultivated myself, and found therefrom"
20933,E. E.,"but a scanty yield, and that quite tasteless and"
20934,E. E.,innutritious. Of trees bearing men we are not without
20935,E. E.,examples; as those in the park of Louis the Eleventh of
20936,E. E.,"France. Who has forgotten, moreover, that olive-tree,"
20937,E. E.,"growing in the Athenian's back-garden, with its strange"
20938,E. E.,"uxorious crop, for the general propagation of which, as of a"
20939,E. E.,"new and precious variety, the philosopher Diogenes, hitherto"
20940,E. E.,"uninterested in arboriculture, was so zealous? In the"
20941,E. E.,"_sylva_ of our own Southern States, the females of my family"
20942,E. E.,have called my attention to the china-tree. Not to multiply
20943,E. E.,"examples, I will barely add to my list the birch-tree, in"
20944,E. E.,the smaller branches of which has been implanted so
20945,E. E.,miraculous a virtue for communicating the Latin and Greek
20946,E. E.,"languages, and which may well, therefore, be classed among"
20947,E. E.,"the trees producing necessaries of life,--_venerabile donum"
20948,E. E.,fatalis virg√¶_. That money-trees existed in the golden age
20949,E. E.,there want not prevalent reasons for our believing. For does
20950,E. E.,"not the old proverb, when it asserts that money does not"
20951,E. E.,"grow on _every_ bush, imply _a fortiori_ that there were"
20952,E. E.,"certain bushes which did produce it? Again, there is another"
20953,E. E.,ancient saw to the effect that money is the _root_ of all
20954,E. E.,evil. From which two adages it may be safe to infer that the
20955,E. E.,"aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub,"
20956,E. E.,"then absconded underground, and finally, in our iron age,"
20957,E. E.,vanished altogether. In favorable exposures it may be
20958,E. E.,"conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age,"
20959,E. E.,"as in the garden of the Hesperides; and, indeed, what else"
20960,E. E.,"could that tree in the Sixth √Üneid have been, with a branch"
20961,E. E.,"whereof the Trojan hero procured admission to a territory,"
20962,E. E.,for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to
20963,E. E.,a certain other more profitable (too) foreign kingdom?
20964,E. E.,"Whether these speculations of mine have any force in them,"
20965,E. E.,"or whether they will not rather, by most readers, be deemed"
20966,E. E.,"impertinent to the matter in hand, is a question which I"
20967,E. E.,leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity. That
20968,E. E.,"there were, in more primitive and happier times, shops where"
20969,E. E.,"money was sold,--and that, too, on credit and at a"
20970,E. E.,"bargain,--I take to be matter of demonstration. For what but"
20971,E. E.,a dealer in this article was that √Üolus who supplied Ulysses
20972,E. E.,"with motive power for his fleet in bags? What that Ericus,"
20973,E. E.,"king of Sweden, who is said to have kept the winds in his"
20974,E. E.,"cap? What, in more recent times, those Lapland Nornas who"
20975,E. E.,traded in favorable breezes? All which will appear the more
20976,E. E.,"clearly when we consider, that, even to this day, _raising"
20977,E. E.,"the wind_ is proverbial for raising money, and that brokers"
20978,E. E.,and banks were invented by the Venetians at a later period.
20979,E. E.,
20980,E. E.,And now for the improvement of this digression. I find a
20981,E. E.,parallel to Mr. Sawin's fortune in an adventure of my own.
20982,E. E.,"For, shortly after I had first broached to myself the"
20983,E. E.,"before-stated natural-historical and arch√¶ological theories,"
20984,E. E.,"as I was passing, _h√¶c negotia penitus mecum revolvens_,"
20985,E. E.,through one of the obscure suburbs of our New England
20986,E. E.,"metropolis, my eye was attracted by these words upon a"
20987,E. E.,"sign-board,--|Cheap Cash-Store|. Here was at once the"
20988,E. E.,"confirmation of my speculations, and the substance of my"
20989,E. E.,"hopes. Here lingered the fragment of a happier past, or"
20990,E. E.,stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more
20991,E. E.,fortunate future. Thus glowed the distant Mexico to the eyes
20992,E. E.,"of Sawin, as he looked through the dirty pane of the"
20993,E. E.,"recruiting-office window, or speculated from the summit of"
20994,E. E.,that mirage-Pisgah which the imps of the bottle are so
20995,E. E.,cunning in raising up. Already had my Alnaschar-fancy (even
20996,E. E.,during that first half-believing glance) expended in various
20997,E. E.,useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the
20998,E. E.,manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses. Already did a
20999,E. E.,"clock ornament the tower of the Jaalam meeting-house, a gift"
21000,E. E.,"appropriately, but modestly, commemorated in the parish and"
21001,E. E.,"town records, both, for now many years, kept by myself."
21002,E. E.,Already had my son Seneca completed his course at the
21003,E. E.,"University. Whether, for the moment, we may not be"
21004,E. E.,considered as actually lording it over those Baratarias with
21005,E. E.,"the viceroyalty of which Hope invests us, and whether we are"
21006,E. E.,"ever so warmly housed as in our Spanish castles, would"
21007,E. E.,afford matter of argument. Enough that I found that
21008,E. E.,sign-board to be no other than a bait to the trap of a
21009,E. E.,"decayed grocer. Nevertheless, I bought a pound of dates"
21010,E. E.,(getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy
21011,E. E.,flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the
21012,E. E.,"very scales), which purchase I made, not only with an eye to"
21013,E. E.,"the little ones at home, but also as a figurative reproof of"
21014,E. E.,"that too frequent habit of my mind, which, forgetting the"
21015,E. E.,"due order of chronology, will often persuade me that the"
21016,E. E.,happy sceptre of Saturn is stretched over this
21017,E. E.,Astr√¶a-forsaken nineteenth century.
21018,E. E.,
21019,E. E.,Having glanced at the ledger of Glory under the title
21020,E. E.,"_Sawin, B._, let us extend our investigations, and discover"
21021,E. E.,if that instructive volume does not contain some charges
21022,E. E.,more personally interesting to ourselves. I think we should
21023,E. E.,"be more economical of our resources, did we thoroughly"
21024,E. E.,"appreciate the fact, that, whenever brother Jonathan seems"
21025,E. E.,"to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket, he is, in"
21026,E. E.,"fact, picking ours. I confess that the late _muck_ which the"
21027,E. E.,country has been running has materially changed my views as
21028,E. E.,"to the best method of raising revenue. If, by means of"
21029,E. E.,"direct taxation, the bills for every extraordinary outlay"
21030,E. E.,"were brought under our immediate eye, so that, like thrifty"
21031,E. E.,"housekeepers, we could see where and how fast the money was"
21032,E. E.,"going, we should be less likely to commit extravagances. At"
21033,E. E.,"present, these things are managed in such a hugger-mugger"
21034,E. E.,"way, that we know not what we pay for; the poor man is"
21035,E. E.,"charged as much as the rich; and, while we are saving and"
21036,E. E.,"scrimping at the spigot, the government is drawing off at"
21037,E. E.,the bung. If we could know that a part of the money we
21038,E. E.,"expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and balls, and"
21039,E. E.,that it is Mexican blood which makes the clothes on our
21040,E. E.,"backs more costly, it would set some of us athinking. During"
21041,E. E.,"the present fall, I have often pictured to myself a"

21043,E. E.,following bill:--

21428,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","for yet a little space, from a sense of official duty, at"

21430,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","requested our preacher to lock the doors, when he should"
21431,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",have wholly relieved himself of his testimony. I confess to
21432,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","a satisfaction in the self act of preaching, nor do I esteem"
21433,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or
21434,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",unintelligent auditory. I cannot easily believe that the
21435,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","Gospel of Saint John, which Jacques Cartier ordered to be"
21436,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","read in the Latin tongue to the Canadian savages, upon his"

21438,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",For the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable
21439,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",by dullest intellects and most alien ears. In this wise did
21440,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","Episcopius convert many to his opinions, who yet understood"
21441,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",not the language in which he discoursed. The chief thing is
21442,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message
21443,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",to deliver. For counterfeit messengers that mode of
21444,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",treatment which Father John de Plano Carpini relates to have
21445,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","prevailed among the Tartars would seem effectual, and,"
21446,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","perhaps, deserved enough. For my own part, I may lay claim"
21447,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me
21448,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",to go into banishment with those clergymen whom Alphonso the
21449,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",Sixth of Portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to
21450,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","shorten their public eloquence. It is possible, that, having"
21451,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","been invited into my brother Biglow's desk, I may have been"
21452,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own
21453,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the
21454,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",expectation and with the desire of hearing him.
21455,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",
21456,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",I am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental
21457,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","organization which impels me, like the railroad-engine with"
21458,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","its train of cars, to run backward for a short distance in"

21460,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high, who,"
21461,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting

21465,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",may haply find something to repay the disappointment of the

21468,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",degenerating more and more from the high standard of our

21470,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",mournfully add also that of listening to two-hour sermons.
21471,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.","Surely we have been abridged into a race of pigmies. For,"

21478,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those
21479,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",whose heads (though no giants) are constantly enveloped in
21480,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",clouds (which that name imports) will never become extinct.
21481,"A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.",The attempt to vanquish the innumerable _heads_ of one of

23440,MOVED INTO IT.,"The whole among them seemed to tear,"

23443,MOVED INTO IT.,
23444,MOVED INTO IT.,Knott was delighted with a pile
23445,MOVED INTO IT.,Approved by fashion's leaders;
23446,MOVED INTO IT.,"(Only he made the builder smile,"

23450,MOVED INTO IT.,Yet better for this luckless man

23453,MOVED INTO IT.,"For, though to quit affairs his plan,"

23455,MOVED INTO IT.,"Perforce, accepting draughts that ran"

23457,MOVED INTO IT.,"The house, though painted stone to mock,"
23458,MOVED INTO IT.,"With nice white lines round every block,"
23459,MOVED INTO IT.,"Some trepidation stood in,"
23460,MOVED INTO IT.,"When tempests (with petrific shock,"
23461,MOVED INTO IT.,"So to speak,) made it really rock,"
23462,MOVED INTO IT.,Though not a whit less wooden;
23463,MOVED INTO IT.,"And painted stone, howe'er well done,"
23464,MOVED INTO IT.,Will not take in the prodigal sun
23465,MOVED INTO IT.,Whose beams are never quite at one
23466,MOVED INTO IT.,With our terrestrial lumber;
23467,MOVED INTO IT.,"So the wood shrank around the knots,"
23468,MOVED INTO IT.,"And gaped in disconcerting spots,"
23469,MOVED INTO IT.,And there were lots of dots and rots
23470,MOVED INTO IT.,"And crannies without number,"
23471,MOVED INTO IT.,"Wherethrough, as you may well presume,"
23472,MOVED INTO IT.,"The wind, like water through a flume,"
23473,MOVED INTO IT.,"Came rushing in ecstatic,"
23474,MOVED INTO IT.,"Leaving, in all three floors, no room"
23475,MOVED INTO IT.,That was not a rheumatic;
23476,MOVED INTO IT.,"And, what with points and squares and rounds"
23477,MOVED INTO IT.,"Grown shaky on their poises,"
23478,MOVED INTO IT.,"The house at night was full of pounds,"
23479,MOVED INTO IT.,"Thumps, bumps, creaks, scratchings, raps--till--""Zounds!"""
23480,MOVED INTO IT.,"Cried Knott, ""this goes beyond all bounds,"

23484,MOVED INTO IT.,
23485,MOVED INTO IT.,"But, though Knott's house was full of airs,"
23486,MOVED INTO IT.,_He_ had but one--a daughter;
23487,MOVED INTO IT.,"And, as he owned much stocks and shares,"
23488,MOVED INTO IT.,Many who wished to render theirs
23489,MOVED INTO IT.,"Such vain, unsatisfying cares,"
23490,MOVED INTO IT.,"And needed wives to sew their tears,"
23491,MOVED INTO IT.,In matrimony sought her;
23492,MOVED INTO IT.,"They vowed her gold they wanted not,"
23493,MOVED INTO IT.,"Their faith would never falter,"
23494,MOVED INTO IT.,They longed to tie this single Knott
23495,MOVED INTO IT.,In the Hymen√¶al halter;
23496,MOVED INTO IT.,"So daily at the door they rang,"
23497,MOVED INTO IT.,"Cards for the belle delivering,"
23498,MOVED INTO IT.,"Or in the choir at her they sang,"
23499,MOVED INTO IT.,Achieving such a rapturous twang
23500,MOVED INTO IT.,As set her nerves a-shivering.
23501,MOVED INTO IT.,
23502,MOVED INTO IT.,Now Knott had quite made up his mind

23504,MOVED INTO IT.,"No beauty he, but oft we find"
23505,MOVED INTO IT.,"Sweet kernels 'neath a roughish rind,"
23506,MOVED INTO IT.,So hoped his Jenny'd be resigned
23507,MOVED INTO IT.,And make no more palaver;
23508,MOVED INTO IT.,"Glanced at the fact that love was blind,"
23509,MOVED INTO IT.,That girls were ratherish inclined
23510,MOVED INTO IT.,"To pet their little crosses,"
23511,MOVED INTO IT.,Then nosologically defined
23512,MOVED INTO IT.,The rate at which the system pined
23513,MOVED INTO IT.,In those unfortunates who dined
23514,MOVED INTO IT.,Upon that metaphoric kind

23516,MOVED INTO IT.,
23517,MOVED INTO IT.,"But she, with many tears and moans,"
23518,MOVED INTO IT.,"Besought him not to mock her,"
23519,MOVED INTO IT.,Said 'twas too much for flesh and bones
23520,MOVED INTO IT.,"To marry mortgages and loans,"
23521,MOVED INTO IT.,That fathers' hearts were stocks and stones
23522,MOVED INTO IT.,"And that she'd go, when Mrs. Jones,"
23523,MOVED INTO IT.,To Davy Jones's locker;
23524,MOVED INTO IT.,Then gave her head a little toss
23525,MOVED INTO IT.,"That said as plain as ever was,"
23526,MOVED INTO IT.,If men are always at a loss
23527,MOVED INTO IT.,Mere womankind to bridle--
23528,MOVED INTO IT.,"To try the thing on woman cross,"
23529,MOVED INTO IT.,Were fifty times as idle;
23530,MOVED INTO IT.,For she a strict resolve had made
23531,MOVED INTO IT.,"And registered in private,"
23532,MOVED INTO IT.,"That either she would die a maid,"
23533,MOVED INTO IT.,"Or else be Mrs. Doctor Slade,"
23534,MOVED INTO IT.,If woman could contrive it;
23535,MOVED INTO IT.,"And, though the wedding-day was set,"
23536,MOVED INTO IT.,"Jenny was more so, rather,"
23537,MOVED INTO IT.,"Declaring, in a pretty pet,"
23538,MOVED INTO IT.,"That, howsoe'er they spread their net,"
23539,MOVED INTO IT.,"She would out-Jennyral them yet,"
23540,MOVED INTO IT.,The colonel and her father.
23541,MOVED INTO IT.,
23542,MOVED INTO IT.,Just at this time the Public's eyes
23543,MOVED INTO IT.,"Were keenly on the watch, a stir"
23544,MOVED INTO IT.,Beginning slowly to arise
23545,MOVED INTO IT.,"About those questions and replies,"
23546,MOVED INTO IT.,Those raps that unwrapped mysteries
23547,MOVED INTO IT.,"So rapidly at Rochester,"
23548,MOVED INTO IT.,"And Knott, already nervous grown"
23549,MOVED INTO IT.,"By lying much awake alone,"
23550,MOVED INTO IT.,"And listening, sometimes to a moan,"
23551,MOVED INTO IT.,"And sometimes to a clatter,"
23552,MOVED INTO IT.,Whene'er the wind at night would rouse
23553,MOVED INTO IT.,"The gingerbread-work on his house,"
23554,MOVED INTO IT.,"Or when some hasty-tempered mouse,"
23555,MOVED INTO IT.,"Behind the plastering, made a towse"
23556,MOVED INTO IT.,"About a family matter,"
23557,MOVED INTO IT.,"Began to wonder if his wife,"

23560,MOVED INTO IT.,"Might not to rule him from her urn,"
23561,MOVED INTO IT.,Have taken a peripatetic turn
23562,MOVED INTO IT.,For want of exorcising.
23563,MOVED INTO IT.,
23564,MOVED INTO IT.,"This thought, once nestled in his head,"
23565,MOVED INTO IT.,"Ere long contagious grew, and spread"
23566,MOVED INTO IT.,"Infecting all his mind with dread,"
23567,MOVED INTO IT.,Until at last he lay in bed
23568,MOVED INTO IT.,"And heard his wife, with well-known tread,"
23569,MOVED INTO IT.,"Entering the kitchen through the shed,"
23570,MOVED INTO IT.,"(Or was't his fancy, mocking?)"
23571,MOVED INTO IT.,"Opening the pantry, cutting bread,"
23572,MOVED INTO IT.,And then (she'd been some ten years dead)
23573,MOVED INTO IT.,Closets and drawers unlocking;
23574,MOVED INTO IT.,"Or, in his room (his breath grew thick)"
23575,MOVED INTO IT.,He heard the long-familiar click
23576,MOVED INTO IT.,"Of slender needles flying quick,"
23577,MOVED INTO IT.,As if she knit a stocking;
23578,MOVED INTO IT.,For whom?--he prayed that years might flit
23579,MOVED INTO IT.,"With pains rheumatic shooting,"
23580,MOVED INTO IT.,Before those ghostly things she knit
23581,MOVED INTO IT.,"Upon his unfleshed sole might fit,"
23582,MOVED INTO IT.,"He did not fancy it a bit,"
23583,MOVED INTO IT.,To stand upon that footing;
23584,MOVED INTO IT.,"At other times, his frightened hairs"
23585,MOVED INTO IT.,"Above the bedclothes trusting,"
23586,MOVED INTO IT.,"He heard her, full of household cares,"
23587,MOVED INTO IT.,"(No dream entrapped in supper's snares,"

23593,MOVED INTO IT.,The raked-up sea-coal's hardened crust--
23594,MOVED INTO IT.,And--what! impossible! it must!
23595,MOVED INTO IT.,"He knew she had returned to dust,"
23596,MOVED INTO IT.,"And yet could scarce his senses trust,"

23598,MOVED INTO IT.,"About the parlor, dusting!"
23599,MOVED INTO IT.,
23600,MOVED INTO IT.,Night after night he strove to sleep
23601,MOVED INTO IT.,And take his ease in spite of it;
23602,MOVED INTO IT.,"But still his flesh would chill and creep,"
23603,MOVED INTO IT.,"And, though two night-lamps he might keep,"
23604,MOVED INTO IT.,He could not so make light of it.
23605,MOVED INTO IT.,"At last, quite desperate, he goes"
23606,MOVED INTO IT.,"And tells his neighbors all his woes,"
23607,MOVED INTO IT.,Which did but their amount enhance;

23613,MOVED INTO IT.,"Another gravely shook his head,"

23615,MOVED INTO IT.,Quite plain poor Knott is going mad--
23616,MOVED INTO IT.,For how can he at once be sad
23617,MOVED INTO IT.,"And think he's full of spirits?"""
23618,MOVED INTO IT.,A third declared he knew a knife

23642,MOVED INTO IT.,To think that day was breaking;
23643,MOVED INTO IT.,"Moreover what he called his park,"
