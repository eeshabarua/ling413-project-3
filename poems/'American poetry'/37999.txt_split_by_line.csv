50,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
51,INTRODUCTION,
52,INTRODUCTION,
53,INTRODUCTION,Arthur Macy was a Nantucket boy of Quaker extraction. His name alone is
54,INTRODUCTION,"evidence of this, for it is safe to say that a Macy, wherever found in"
55,INTRODUCTION,"the United States, is descended from that sturdy old Quaker who was one"
56,INTRODUCTION,"of those who bought Nantucket from the Indians, paid them fairly for it,"
57,INTRODUCTION,"treated them with justice, and lived on friendly terms with them. In"
58,INTRODUCTION,"many ways Arthur Macy showed that he was a Nantucketer and, at least by"
59,INTRODUCTION,"descent, a Quaker. He often used phrases peculiar to our island in the"
60,INTRODUCTION,"sea, and was given, in conversation at least, to similes which smacked"
61,INTRODUCTION,"of salt water. Almost the last time I saw him he said, ""I'm coming round"
62,INTRODUCTION,"soon for a good long gam."""
63,INTRODUCTION,
64,INTRODUCTION,He was a many-sided man. In his intercourse with a friend like myself he
65,INTRODUCTION,"would show the side which he thought would interest me, and that only."
66,INTRODUCTION,"He was above all things cheery, and, to his praise be it said, he hated"
67,INTRODUCTION,a bore. I remember that a mutual friend was talking baseball to me by
68,INTRODUCTION,"the yard. Arthur was sitting by, listening. It was a subject in which he"
69,INTRODUCTION,"was much interested. Nevertheless, turning to our mutual friend, he"
70,INTRODUCTION,"said, ""Don't talk baseball to _him_. He don't care anything about it, he"
71,INTRODUCTION,"don't know anything about it, and he don't want to."" On the other hand,"
72,INTRODUCTION,"although little given to telling of his war experiences, he was always"
73,INTRODUCTION,"ready to talk over the old days with me. Of what he did himself, he"
74,INTRODUCTION,"modestly said but little, but of the services of others, more especially"
75,INTRODUCTION,"of the men in the ranks, he was generous in his praise."
76,INTRODUCTION,
77,INTRODUCTION,"Early in the war Macy enlisted in Company B, 24th Michigan Volunteer"
78,INTRODUCTION,"Infantry. He was twice wounded on the first day at Gettysburg, and"
79,INTRODUCTION,managed to crawl into the town and get as far as the steps of the Court
80,INTRODUCTION,"House, which was fast filling with wounded from both sides. His sense of"
81,INTRODUCTION,humor was in evidence even at such a time. A Confederate officer rode up
82,INTRODUCTION,"and asked, ""Have those men in there got arms?"" Quick as a flash Macy"
83,INTRODUCTION,"answered: ""Some of them have and some of them haven't."" He remained in"
84,INTRODUCTION,"this Court-House hospital, a prisoner within the Confederate lines,"
85,INTRODUCTION,until the battle was over and Lee's army retreated. All wounded
86,INTRODUCTION,"prisoners who could walk were forced to go with them, but Macy's wound"
87,INTRODUCTION,"was in the foot, and, fortunately for him, he was spared the horrors of"
88,INTRODUCTION,a Southern prison.
89,INTRODUCTION,
90,INTRODUCTION,"He was on duty later at the Naval Academy Hospital in Annapolis,"
91,INTRODUCTION,"presided over by Dr. Vanderkieft, perhaps as efficient a general"
92,INTRODUCTION,hospital administrator as the army had. I knew Dr. Vanderkieft very
93,INTRODUCTION,"well, and was on duty at his hospital when the exchanged prisoners came"
94,INTRODUCTION,"back from Andersonville. Although Macy and I never met there, it came"
95,INTRODUCTION,out in our talk that we were there at the same time. He served his full
96,INTRODUCTION,"three years, and was honorably discharged about the close of the war."
97,INTRODUCTION,
98,INTRODUCTION,It is given to but few to have the keen sense of humor which he
99,INTRODUCTION,"possessed. Quick and keen at repartee, he never practised it save when"
100,INTRODUCTION,worth while. He never said the clearly obvious thing. Failing something
101,INTRODUCTION,"better than that, he held his peace."
102,INTRODUCTION,
103,INTRODUCTION,"Had it not been for his disinclination to publish his verses, he long"
104,INTRODUCTION,ago would have had a national reputation. His reason for this
105,INTRODUCTION,"disinclination, as I gathered from many talks with him, was that he did"
106,INTRODUCTION,not consider his work of sufficiently high _poetic_ standard. Every one
107,INTRODUCTION,"praised his choice of words, his wonderful facility in rhyme, the"
108,INTRODUCTION,"perfection of his metre, and the daintiness and delicacy of his verse."
109,INTRODUCTION,"""All right,"" he would say, ""but that is not Poetry with a big P, and"
110,INTRODUCTION,that is the only kind that should be published. And there is mighty
111,INTRODUCTION,"little of it."" It is fortunate that this severe judgment, creditable as"
112,INTRODUCTION,"it was to him, is not to prevail. Lovers of the beautiful are not to be"
113,INTRODUCTION,"robbed of ""Sit Closer, Friends,"" nor of ""A Poet's Lesson,"" and many who"
114,INTRODUCTION,never heard of that remarkable Spanish pachyderm will take delight in
115,INTRODUCTION,"the story of ""The Rollicking Mastodon,"" whose home was ""in the trunk of"
116,INTRODUCTION,"a Tranquil Tree."" The greater part of his verses with which I am"
117,INTRODUCTION,"familiar I heard at Papyrus Club dinners. He was an early member, and"
118,INTRODUCTION,one of the most esteemed. He was fairly sure to have something in his
119,INTRODUCTION,"pocket, and the presiding officer never called upon him in vain."
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,"It was so at the Saint Botolph Club, of which he was long a member."
122,INTRODUCTION,"Whenever there was an ""occasion"" when the need of verse seemed"
123,INTRODUCTION,"indicated, Arthur Macy could be counted on. His ""Saint Botolph,"" which"
124,INTRODUCTION,"has become the Club song, and will be sung as long as the Club endures,"
125,INTRODUCTION,was written for a Twelfth Night revel at my request. It has a peculiarly
126,INTRODUCTION,"old English flavor. He makes of the Saint, not the jolly friar nor yet"
127,INTRODUCTION,"the severe recluse, but just a good, kind old man who ""was loved by the"
128,INTRODUCTION,"sinners and loved by the good,"" one who was certain that there must be"
129,INTRODUCTION,sin so long as
130,INTRODUCTION,
131,INTRODUCTION,"""A few get the loaves and many get the crumbs,"
132,INTRODUCTION,"And some are born fingers and some are born thumbs."""
133,INTRODUCTION,
134,INTRODUCTION,"And here we get a glimpse of Arthur Macy's view of life, which was"
135,INTRODUCTION,"certainly broad and generous, with a philosophic flavor."
136,INTRODUCTION,
137,INTRODUCTION,Arthur Macy had a business side of which his Club intimates had but
138,INTRODUCTION,"slight knowledge. He represented, in New England, one of the great"
139,INTRODUCTION,"commercial agencies of the country. His knowledge of business men, of"
140,INTRODUCTION,"their standing, commercially and financially, was extended and intimate,"
141,INTRODUCTION,and was relied upon by our merchants and others as a basis for giving
142,INTRODUCTION,credit. His office work required the closest attention to details and
143,INTRODUCTION,the exercise of the most careful judgment. The whole success of such a
144,INTRODUCTION,company as that which he represented depends upon the reliability of the
145,INTRODUCTION,information which it gives. Without this it has no reason for existence.
146,INTRODUCTION,It was to Arthur Macy that the merchants of Boston largely turned for
147,INTRODUCTION,"information concerning their customers scattered throughout New England,"
148,INTRODUCTION,and it was because of his success in obtaining such information and his
149,INTRODUCTION,thorough knowledge of the business in all its details that the superior
150,INTRODUCTION,officers of the company placed such implicit confidence in his judgment
151,INTRODUCTION,and so high a value upon his advice. And in the conduct of this business
152,INTRODUCTION,he showed his Quaker straightforwardness. His work was not at all of the
153,INTRODUCTION,"""detective"" sort. If information was wanted concerning a man's business"
154,INTRODUCTION,"by those who had dealings with him, Macy went directly to the man"
155,INTRODUCTION,"himself, and told him that it was for his own best interest to show just"
156,INTRODUCTION,"where he stood, and, above all things, to tell the exact truth. Honest"
157,INTRODUCTION,"men had the truth told about them, and profited by it. Dishonest men and"
158,INTRODUCTION,"secretive men were passed over in severe silence, and their credit"
159,INTRODUCTION,suffered accordingly. Few of those who sought Arthur Macy for business
160,INTRODUCTION,information ever suspected that they were talking to a poet and man of
161,INTRODUCTION,letters.
162,INTRODUCTION,
163,INTRODUCTION,I have not sought to tell Arthur Macy's life story. Neither have I
164,INTRODUCTION,entered upon any detailed consideration of his verse. It is for the
165,INTRODUCTION,reader to peruse the pages that follow and draw his own conclusion. I
166,INTRODUCTION,have merely tried to give a glimpse of the characteristics of one of the
167,INTRODUCTION,most charming personalities I ever knew.

383,THE OLD CAFÉ,Just fit for us--or kings!
384,THE OLD CAFÉ,At times a quaint and wickered flask
385,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Of rare Chianti, or from the homelier cask"
386,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Of modest Pilsener a stein or so,"

405,THE OLD CAFÉ,Under the magic of the wine;
406,THE OLD CAFÉ,"But now I read them o'er,"
407,THE OLD CAFÉ,"And see grave faults I had not seen before,"
408,THE OLD CAFÉ,And wonder how
409,THE OLD CAFÉ,"You could have listened with such placid brow,"
410,THE OLD CAFÉ,And somehow apprehend
411,THE OLD CAFÉ,You sank the critic in the friend.
412,THE OLD CAFÉ,"You know,"

414,THE OLD CAFÉ,

417,THE OLD CAFÉ,"And few the bards we could not quote,"
418,THE OLD CAFÉ,From gay Catullus' lines to Milton's purer note.
419,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Mayhap we now are wiser men,"
420,THE OLD CAFÉ,But we knew more than all the scholars then;
421,THE OLD CAFÉ,And our conceit
422,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Was grand, ineffable, complete!"
423,THE OLD CAFÉ,"We know,"
424,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Don't we, Joe?"
425,THE OLD CAFÉ,

430,THE OLD CAFÉ,Years sad and tremulous
431,THE OLD CAFÉ,May be in store for us;
432,THE OLD CAFÉ,But should we ever meet
433,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Upon some quiet street,"
434,THE OLD CAFÉ,And you discover in an old man's eye
435,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Some transient sparkle of the days gone by,"
436,THE OLD CAFÉ,"Then you will guess, perchance,"

529,DISENCHANTMENT,
530,DISENCHANTMENT,Time and I have fallen out;
531,DISENCHANTMENT,"We, who were such steadfast friends."
532,DISENCHANTMENT,So slowly has it come about
533,DISENCHANTMENT,That none may tell when it began;
534,DISENCHANTMENT,Yet sure am I a cunning plan
535,DISENCHANTMENT,Runs through it all;
536,DISENCHANTMENT,"And now, beyond recall,"
537,DISENCHANTMENT,"Our friendship ends,"
538,DISENCHANTMENT,"And ending, there remains to me"
539,DISENCHANTMENT,The memory of disloyalty.
540,DISENCHANTMENT,
541,DISENCHANTMENT,Long years ago Time tripping came
542,DISENCHANTMENT,"With promise grand,"
543,DISENCHANTMENT,And sweet assurances of fame;
544,DISENCHANTMENT,And hand in hand
545,DISENCHANTMENT,Through fairy-land
546,DISENCHANTMENT,Went he and I together
547,DISENCHANTMENT,In bright and golden weather.
548,DISENCHANTMENT,"Then, then I had not learned to doubt,"
549,DISENCHANTMENT,"For friends were gods, and faith was sure,"
550,DISENCHANTMENT,"And words were truth, and deeds were pure,"
551,DISENCHANTMENT,Before we had our falling out;
552,DISENCHANTMENT,"And life, all hope, was fair to see,"
553,DISENCHANTMENT,When Time made promise sweet to me.
554,DISENCHANTMENT,
555,DISENCHANTMENT,When first my faithless friend grew cold
556,DISENCHANTMENT,"I sought to knit a closer bond,"
557,DISENCHANTMENT,"But he, less fond,"
558,DISENCHANTMENT,"Sad days and years upon me rolled,"
559,DISENCHANTMENT,"Pressed me with care,"
560,DISENCHANTMENT,"With envy tinged the boyhood hair,"
561,DISENCHANTMENT,And ploughed unwelcome furrows in
562,DISENCHANTMENT,Where none had been.
563,DISENCHANTMENT,In vain I begged with trembling lip
564,DISENCHANTMENT,"For our old sweet companionship,"
565,DISENCHANTMENT,"And saw, 'mid prayers and tears devout,"
566,DISENCHANTMENT,The presage of our falling out.
567,DISENCHANTMENT,
568,DISENCHANTMENT,"And now I know Time has no friends,"
569,DISENCHANTMENT,"Nor pity lends,"
570,DISENCHANTMENT,But touches all
571,DISENCHANTMENT,With heavy finger soon or late;
572,DISENCHANTMENT,And as we wait
573,DISENCHANTMENT,"The Reaper's call,"
574,DISENCHANTMENT,"The sickle's fatal sweep,"
575,DISENCHANTMENT,We strive in vain to keep
576,DISENCHANTMENT,"One truth inviolate,"
577,DISENCHANTMENT,One cherished fancy free from doubt.
578,DISENCHANTMENT,It was not so
579,DISENCHANTMENT,"Long years ago,"
580,DISENCHANTMENT,Before we had our falling out.
581,DISENCHANTMENT,
582,DISENCHANTMENT,"If Time would come again to me,"
583,DISENCHANTMENT,And once more take me by the hand
584,DISENCHANTMENT,"For golden walks through fairy-land,"
585,DISENCHANTMENT,I could forgive the treachery
586,DISENCHANTMENT,That stole my youth
587,DISENCHANTMENT,And what of truth
588,DISENCHANTMENT,Was mine to know;
589,DISENCHANTMENT,Nor would I more his love misdoubt;
590,DISENCHANTMENT,And I would throw
591,DISENCHANTMENT,"My arms around him so,"
592,DISENCHANTMENT,That he'd forgive the falling out!

751,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"A Common Councilman, with lordly air,"
752,PRISMATIC BOSTON,One day went strolling down through Copley Square.
753,PRISMATIC BOSTON,Within his breast there beat a spotless heart;
754,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"His taste was pure, his soul was steeped in art."
755,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"For he had worshiped oft at Cass's shrine,"
756,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Had daily knelt at Cogswell's fount divine,"
757,PRISMATIC BOSTON,And chaste surroundings of the City Hall
758,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Had taught him much, and so he knew it all."

760,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Content in knowing just ""where he was at,"""
761,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"He wandered on, till gazing toward the skies,"
762,PRISMATIC BOSTON,A nameless horror met his modest eyes;
763,PRISMATIC BOSTON,For where the artist's chisel had engrossed
764,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"An emblem fit on Boston's proudest boast,"
765,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"There stood aloft, with graceful equipoise,"
766,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Two very small, unexpurgated boys."
767,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Filled with solicitude for city youth,"
768,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Whose morals suffer when they're told the truth,"
769,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Whose ethic standards high and higher rise,"
770,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"When taught that God and nature are but lies,"
771,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"In haste he to the council chamber hied,"
772,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"His startled fellow-members called aside,"
773,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"His fearful secret whispering disclosed,"
774,PRISMATIC BOSTON,Till all their separate joints were ankylosed.
775,PRISMATIC BOSTON,Appalling was the silence at his tale;
776,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Democrats turned red, Republicans turned pale."
777,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"What mugwumps turned 'tis difficult to think,"
778,PRISMATIC BOSTON,But probably they compromised on pink.
779,PRISMATIC BOSTON,
780,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"When these stern moralists had their breaths regained,"
781,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"And told how deeply they were shocked and pained,"
782,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"They then resolved how wrong our children are,"
783,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Said, ""Boys should be contented with a scar,"""
784,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Rebuked Dame Nature for her deadly sins,"
785,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"And damned trustees who foster ""Heavenly Twins."""
786,PRISMATIC BOSTON,
787,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"O Councilmen, if it were left for you"
788,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"To say what art is false and what is true,"
789,PRISMATIC BOSTON,What strange anomalies would the world behold!
790,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"Dolls would be angels, dross would count for gold;"

793,PRISMATIC BOSTON,And this sage law by your wise minds be built:
794,PRISMATIC BOSTON,"""No boy shall live if born without a kilt."""

2241,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,"Indeed, 'twas a matter of family pride;"
2242,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,And oh! so proud of his jocular vein

2244,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,
2245,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,"The Rollicking Mastodon said one day,"

2270,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,
2271,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,"""Alas! and alas! has it come to this pass?"""

2275,THE ROLLICKING MASTODON,"The Mastodon stopped; his ditty he dropped,"
