138,I,
139,I,
140,I,As a blown leaf across the face of Time
141,I,Your name falls emptily upon my heart.
142,I,"In this new symmetry you have no part,"
143,I,No lot in my fair life. The stars still chime
144,I,Autumn and Spring in ceaseless pantomime.
145,I,"I play with Beauty, which is kin to Art,"
146,I,Forgetting Nature.  Nor do pulses start
147,I,To hear your soul remembered in a rhyme.
148,I,
149,I,You may not vex me any more. The stark
150,I,"Terror of life has passed, and all the stress."
151,I,"Winds had their will of me, and now caress,"
152,I,"Blown from bland groves I know. Time dreams, and I,"
153,I,"As on a mirror, see the days go by"
154,I,In nonchalant procession to the dark.

163,II,
164,II,"I, living love and laughter, have forgot"
165,II,The way the heart has uttered melody.
166,II,"As sobbing, plaintive cadence of the sea"
167,II,"A poet's soul should rest, remembering not"
168,II,"The inland paths of green, the flowers, the spot"
169,II,Where fairies ring. In hermit ecstasy
170,II,"Music is born, and gay or wofully"
171,II,Lovers of Poesy share her lonely lot.
172,II,
173,II,"For you and me, Beloved, crowned with Spring,"
174,II,"Catching Love's flowers from off the lap of Time,"
175,II,What are the songs my voice has scorned to sing?
176,II,Ghostly they hover round my heart-wise lips;
177,II,"Into a kiss I fold my rose of Rhyme,"
178,II,Laid like a martyr on your finger-tips.

185,III,_As a Pale Child_
186,III,
187,III,
188,III,"As a pale child, hemmed in by windy rain,"
189,III,"Patiently turns to touch his well-known toys,"
190,III,"Playing as children play who make no noise,"
191,III,"Yet happy in a way; then sighs again,"
192,III,"To watch the world across the storm-dim pane,"
193,III,And sees with wistful eyes glad girls and boys
194,III,"Who romp beneath the rain's unlicensed joys,"
195,III,And feels wild longings sweep his gentle brain.
196,III,
197,III,"So I, contented with my flowers for stars,"
198,III,"Stroll in my fair, walled garden happily,"
199,III,"Knowing no gladder game till, shrill and sweet,"
200,III,"I hear life's cry ring down the silent street,"
201,III,And press my face against the sunlit bars
202,III,To watch the joyous spirits who are free.

209,IV,_Flower of the Clove_
210,IV,
211,IV,
212,IV,"Ah, Love, have pity!--I am but a child;"
213,IV,"I ask but light and laughter, and the tears"
214,IV,Darken the sunlight of my fairest years.
215,IV,"By love made desolate, by love beguiled,"
216,IV,I waste the Spring. Love's harvest wains are piled
217,IV,With poppies and gold grain--I glean but fears
218,IV,"Of empty hands, grim hunger, and the jeers"
219,IV,Of happy wives whose loves are reconciled.
220,IV,
221,IV,"But mine! Ah, mine is like a tattered leaf"
222,IV,"Upon a turbid stream. I have no pride,"
223,IV,"No life, but love, which is a bitter grief."
224,IV,As a lost star I wander down your sky.
225,IV,Give me your heart. Open it wide--so wide!
226,IV,"I must have love and laughter, or I die."

233,V,_Too Late_
234,V,
235,V,
236,V,Upon your stone the wine of my desire
237,V,Is spilled. Your poppy lips have grown too pale
238,V,From fasting. Your white hands will not avail
239,V,The cold eyes of your heart to light the fire.
240,V,I did not think my prayers could ever tire.
241,V,"Now, like doomed ships, they flutter without sail."
242,V,"Lost in a calm which held no rock, no gale--"
243,V,"Now, when your chilly smile bids me aspire!"
244,V,
245,V,"So, without history, my soul is slain--"
246,V,Woman of barren love; the wine was red--
247,V,Beautiful for your spending. Not again
248,V,Will the bud blossom where the frost has sped.
249,V,"Timid, you dared not hark when angels sang."
250,V,"All, all is lost, without one saving pang."

257,VI,_The Supreme Sacrifice_
258,VI,
259,VI,
260,VI,"Better than life, better than sea and morn,"
261,VI,And all the sun-stained fragments of the day--
262,VI,"Ah! more than breeze, than purple clouds that stray"
263,VI,"Across dim twilights--I, the tempest-torn,"
264,VI,"Fighting the stars for glory, who must scorn"
265,VI,Heart-drops bespread along love's cruel way
266,VI,Like scattered petals on the breast of May--
267,VI,"Better than life I love you, I forlorn."
268,VI,
269,VI,Better than death--the sleeping and the peace
270,VI,When warm within the breast of brooding Earth
271,VI,"My weary heart should give its woes release,"
272,VI,"The pitiful dark remembering not my loss,"
273,VI,"The calm, wise years restoring joy for dearth--"
274,VI,"Better than death, my love, my burning cross."

281,VII,_Malua_
282,VII,
283,VII,
284,VII,Out of the purple treasuries of night
285,VII,Came the dark wind of evening silver-starred--
286,VII,Stirred on his cheek. The forest keeping ward
287,VII,"Breathed with a tremulous silence, and the bright,"
288,VII,Bare moon crowned his adoring brow with light.
289,VII,The exquisite dream of beauty held him hard
290,VII,"In a great love, a forest love, unmarred--"
291,VII,Still unprofaned--by human nature's sight.
292,VII,
293,VII,"Guarding the temple gates of peace he stood,"
294,VII,Statue of bronze with pagan heart of stone.
295,VII,"Sudden, a dazzling glory lit the wood--"
296,VII,Moon in his soul that dimmed the moon above.
297,VII,"Life was revealed, a Spring-sweet maid, alone--"
298,VII,"Beauty was woman, and the woman--Love."

305,VIII,_Love's Legacy_
306,VIII,
307,VIII,
308,VIII,As one who looks too long upon the sun
309,VIII,When he must turn to earth from flame-shot skies
310,VIII,"Sees all else dark through his bereaved eyes,"
311,VIII,And yet may watch the rainbow ribbons run
312,VIII,"Athwart the gravity of gray and dun,"
313,VIII,He holds the darkness dearer for the prize
314,VIII,Wherein his only pledge of radiance lies
315,VIII,When he the vast magnificence must shun.
316,VIII,
317,VIII,"So we who play with rainbows, having seen"
318,VIII,"The sun's own face. We may not hold the west,"
319,VIII,"Which burns against the bosom of the night,"
320,VIII,"But in the after-glow, with eyes serene,"
321,VIII,"We still may find, dear heart, the sun's bequest,"
322,VIII,An echoed glory of our passionate light.

329,IX,_How we would Live!_
330,IX,
331,IX,
332,IX,"How we would live! We'd drink the years like wine,"
333,IX,"With all to-morrows hid behind the veil,"
334,IX,Which is your hair; between two lilies pale--
335,IX,"Your slender hands--my heart should lie and shine,"
336,IX,A crimson rose. We'd catch the wind and twine
337,IX,The evening stars--a chaplet musical--
338,IX,"To crown our folly, lure the nightingale"
339,IX,To sing the bliss your lips should teach to mine.
340,IX,
341,IX,"And if the sage, declaring life is vain,"
342,IX,Should frown upon the flower of all our days
343,IX,"And chide the sun that knows no tears of rain,"
344,IX,He should not tease our heart with cynic eye--
345,IX,The soul's vast altar stands beyond his gaze
346,IX,When two have lived--then shall they fear to die?

354,X,
355,X,
356,X,"Nay, touch me not, nor even with your eyes"
357,X,"Hold mine, for I would speak you, thus afar,"
358,X,Aloof and chill and lonely as a star.
359,X,"The hands that urge, the hungry heart that cries,"
360,X,Have wrapped my love with love's elusive lies;
361,X,The lips that burn have laid a ruddy scar
362,X,"Against the truth that stands without the bar,"
363,X,And blinded faith with passion's mysteries.
364,X,
365,X,"Night holds a single moon, day one desire--"
366,X,"Her golden sun; and life a love supreme,"
367,X,"Wherein one moment poises, crowned with fire,"
368,X,"White with the naked truth. Beyond control,"
369,X,"'Tis here, my Sun, in love's last hour extreme,"
370,X,"I hold aloft my bare, adoring soul."

377,XI,_The Forgiveness_
378,XI,
379,XI,
380,XI,"If I might see you dead, Beloved--dead--"
381,XI,"Your false eyes closed forever to the light,"
382,XI,Your false smile stilled upon my aching sight;
383,XI,"If I might know that nevermore your head,"
384,XI,"Cruelly fair, could lie upon the bed"
385,XI,Of my torn heart; if I beheld the night
386,XI,"Free from your living thought--ah! if I might,"
387,XI,Then could my desolate soul be comforted.
388,XI,
389,XI,For this is worst of all the woes you gave--
390,XI,My heart may not forgive. The tired years go
391,XI,"And leave the great love weeping for a grave,"
392,XI,"Scorned and unburied, 'neath the open sky."
393,XI,"I could not love you less, to see you so."
394,XI,"Loving you more, I might forgive--and die."

401,XII,_With Music_
402,XII,
403,XII,
404,XII,"Dear, did we meet in some dim yesterday?"
405,XII,I half remember how the birds were mute
406,XII,"Among green leaves and tulip-tinted fruit,"
407,XII,"And on the grass, beside a stream, we lay"
408,XII,"In early twilight; faintly, far away,"
409,XII,"Came lovely sounds adrift from silver lute,"
410,XII,"With answered echoes of an airy flute,"
411,XII,"While Twilight waited tiptoe, fain to stay."
412,XII,
413,XII,Her violet eyes were sweet with mystery.
414,XII,"You looked in mine, the music rose and fell"
415,XII,"Like little, lisping laughter of the sea;"
416,XII,"Our souls were barks, wind-wafted from the shore--"
417,XII,"Gold cup, a rose, a ruby, who can tell?"
418,XII,Soft--music ceases--I recall no more.

425,XIII,_Alpha and Omega_
426,XIII,
427,XIII,
428,XIII,"I died to-day, and yet upon my eyes"
429,XIII,A glamour of the gorgeous summer green
430,XIII,"Still wavers, and my brain has kept a keen,"
431,XIII,"Sweet bird-song. Glad with light, the summer skies"
432,XIII,"Are sapphire, and a purple shadow lies"
433,XIII,Across the hills--no change is on the scene
434,XIII,Since happy yesterday. Ah! can it mean
435,XIII,The body lives when stricken spirit dies?
436,XIII,

1516,XXX,"Upon the lonely avenue of trees,"
1517,XXX,"As pearls upon an airy silver string,"
1518,XXX,Are caught the threaded echoes of the breeze
1519,XXX,That sets the ruffled leaves a-murmuring.
1520,XXX,
1521,XXX,"Be still, dear heart, as though 'twere death to speak."
1522,XXX,"Love waits you, lily-like, with leaves unfurled,"
1523,XXX,"While on the breast of day night lays her cheek,"
1524,XXX,The silence speaks the secret of the world.

1534,XXXI,"Butterfly words from the sun in my brain,"
1535,XXXI,"Flitting and darting and flitting again,"
1536,XXXI,"Gleaming of golden and violet and rose,"
1537,XXXI,"What is the rainbow you spring from, and where?"
1538,XXXI,"Butterflies daintily poise and disclose,"
1539,XXXI,Whence is this secret of color you bear?
1540,XXXI,
1541,XXXI,"Sun that is ruddy and fragrant with flowers,"
1542,XXXI,"Garnered and hid from these desolate hours,"
1543,XXXI,"Misty with beauty, the silver of spring--"
1544,XXXI,"Ah, for the ways that are lost to my feet!"
1545,XXXI,"Only the dip of the butterfly wing,"
1546,XXXI,"Poised for a moment, revives me the sweet."

1558,XXXII,"Fingers so delicate slender,"
1559,XXXII,Pale as the ghost of a flower.
1560,XXXII,
1561,XXXII,"Jewels of crimson, the life"
1562,XXXII,"Ebbing from hearts that are broken,"
1563,XXXII,"Roses and wine and red sunsets,"
1564,XXXII,Flames of undying desire.
1565,XXXII,
1566,XXXII,"Jewels of azure, the sea"
1567,XXXII,"Dreaming of stars, and the morning"
1568,XXXII,"Dancing with life, then the silence"
1569,XXXII,Blue of mysterious caves.
1570,XXXII,
1571,XXXII,"Jewels of green, and the grass"
1572,XXXII,"Lifts up its hands to the summer,"
1573,XXXII,"Hiding insidious serpents,"
1574,XXXII,Fair as the sweets that are sin.
1575,XXXII,
1576,XXXII,Jewels more bright than the sun
1577,XXXII,Music lets fall from her fingers.

1588,XXXIII,
1589,XXXIII,"You came and you went, and I swept you aside, not a trace"
1590,XXXIII,Does my wisdom endure of your words and your beautiful face
1591,XXXIII,And the curls of your hair;
1592,XXXIII,"Yet your presence, a song, murmurs ever in hopeless refrain,"
1593,XXXIII,And I wake in the night with my empty hands yearning in vain
1594,XXXIII,For the touch of your hair.
1595,XXXIII,
1596,XXXIII,"You went, and I triumphed--I crushed out my heart with a kiss"
1597,XXXIII,"On the lips that are ashen, forgetting spring's wonderful bliss"
1598,XXXIII,And your tremulous lips;
1599,XXXIII,"Yet the kisses were ghostly with jasmine, dear jasmine of May--"
1600,XXXIII,"The new has the soul of the old, is aflame with the way"
1601,XXXIII,And the touch of your lips.
1602,XXXIII,
1603,XXXIII,"You came and you went, and the world wearies on with its game."
1604,XXXIII,My heart never falters or fears at the sound of your name
1605,XXXIII,Or the sight of your face;
1606,XXXIII,"Yet the ghost of our passion stands white in the midst of my heart,"
1607,XXXIII,"With your hands and your hair, and I know it will never depart"
1608,XXXIII,Passion's ghost with your face!

1620,XXXIV,Love prove a lie and wisdom bitterness--
1621,XXXIV,"Fight, for the strife alone avails for all."
1622,XXXIV,
1623,XXXIV,"Fight and fight on, exulting in the light,"

1638,XXXV,The dawn mist rises on the forest floor--
1639,XXXV,Alas for life when love goes wandering!
1640,XXXV,"With wet, green leaves the palm-trees lash the night,"
1641,XXXV,The pitiless trades drive wild gods in their flight.
1642,XXXV,"And, ah, my lover! Moons have come and gone,"
1643,XXXV,"The fighting ended, still he lingers on."
1644,XXXV,Sleepless I hear the demon wind above--
1645,XXXV,Alas for love when love goes wandering!

1658,XXXVI,Straining within the galleys' reeling night.
1659,XXXVI,"Life bent to breaking, while their great souls grew"
1660,XXXVI,Strong in the ancient purposes of Time.
1661,XXXVI,"This was the song whereby they made their fight,"
1662,XXXVI,Laughed as they swung. Gods! how the cord bit through!
1663,XXXVI,
1664,XXXVI,"This was the song the pagan lovers heard,"
1665,XXXVI,Wakened by flowers in a rose-red dawn.
1666,XXXVI,"Through the bright dew they fled, like ocean stirred"
1667,XXXVI,"With morning. Bare and beautiful they ran,"
1668,XXXVI,"Holding each other's hand. Through leaves they're gone,"
1669,XXXVI,Cleaving the silver pool with flash of bird.
1670,XXXVI,
1671,XXXVI,"Carven in stone, Abydos holds it fast--"
1672,XXXVI,"The little Eastern dancer with her lute,"
1673,XXXVI,Wild Erin's faeries crying for the past.
1674,XXXVI,They keep the deathless secret of the word
1675,XXXVI,"Hid behind Nature's lips, who, grave, remote,"
1676,XXXVI,Guard this from profanation till the last.
1677,XXXVI,
1678,XXXVI,"Not unto us who bide the ebb and flow,"
1679,XXXVI,The senseless order of the tide of law.
1680,XXXVI,We have forgotten to be free; we know
1681,XXXVI,Only the iteration of the day.
1682,XXXVI,"The priceless moon, white pearl without a flaw,"
1683,XXXVI,Drowns in the muddy stream of worldly woe.
1684,XXXVI,
1685,XXXVI,We take the petty part and leave the whole.
1686,XXXVI,Lost to our ken the song of Nature's youth--
1687,XXXVI,The great barbaric winds that sweep the soul
1688,XXXVI,And leave it emptied of all else but truth.

1702,XXXVII,
1703,XXXVII,"They fell in countless happy hearts,"
