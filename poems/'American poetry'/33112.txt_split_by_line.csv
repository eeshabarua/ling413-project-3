21,,"High on the world did our fathers of old,"
22,,"Under the stars and stripes,"
23,,"Blazon the name that we now must uphold,"
24,,Under the stars and stripes.
25,,Vast in the past they have builded an arch
26,,Over which Freedom has lighted her torch.
27,,"Follow it! Follow it! Come, let us march"
28,,Under the stars and stripes!
29,,
30,,"We in whose bodies the blood of them runs,"
31,,"Under the stars and stripes,"
32,,"We will acquit us as sons of their sons,"
33,,Under the stars and stripes.
34,,"Ever for justice, our heel upon wrong,"
35,,We in the light of our vengeance thrice strong!
36,,Rally together! Come tramping along
37,,Under the stars and stripes!
38,,
39,,"Out of our strength and a nation's great need,"
40,,"Under the stars and stripes,"
41,,"Heroes again as of old we shall breed,"
42,,Under the stars and stripes.
43,,Broad to the winds be our banner unfurled!
44,,Straight in Spain's face let defiance be hurled!
45,,"God on our side, we will battle the world"
46,,Under the stars and stripes!

231,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,Of stars immortal for the march of Time.
232,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,
233,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,"But where are now the Glory and the Rapture,"
234,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,That once did capture me in cloud and stream?
235,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,Where now the Joy that was both speech and silence?
236,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,Where the beguilance that was fact and dream?
237,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,
238,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,I know that Earth and Heaven are as golden
239,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,As they of olden made me feel and see;
240,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,Not in themselves is lacking aught of power
241,THE EVANESCENT BEAUTIFUL.,Through star and flower--something's lost in me.

256,I,"Clad on with glowing beauty and the peace,"
257,I,"Benign, of calm maturity, she stands"
258,I,"Among her meadows and her orchard-lands,"
259,I,"And on her mellowing gardens and her trees,"
260,I,"Out of the ripe abundance of her hands,"
261,I,Bestows increase
262,I,"And fruitfulness, as, wrapped in sunny ease,"
263,I,"Blue-eyed and blonde she goes,"
264,I,Upon her bosom _Summer's_ richest rose.

272,II,"In flower and fruit, in rounded nut and seed:"
273,II,She in whose path the very shadows gleam;
274,II,Whose humblest weed
275,II,"Seems lovelier than _June's_ loveliest flower, indeed,"

284,III,"Where you may see her standing hours on hours,"
285,III,"Breast-deep in gold, soft-holding up a bee"
286,III,To her hushed ear; or sitting under bowers
287,III,"Of greenery,"
288,III,A butterfly a-tilt upon her knee;
289,III,"Or, lounging on her hip,"
290,III,Dancing a cricket on her finger-tip.

295,IV,"Aye, let me breathe hot scents that tell of you:"
296,IV,"The hoary catnip and the meadow-mint,"
297,IV,On which the honour of your touch doth print
298,IV,Itself as odour. Let me drink the hue
299,IV,"Of ironweed and mist-flow'r here that hint,"
300,IV,"With purple and blue,"
301,IV,The rapture that your presence doth imbue
302,IV,"Their inmost essence with,"

313,V,Soft on the pure

601,THE MOONMEN.,
602,THE MOONMEN.,The Wind was a wizard who muttering strode
603,THE MOONMEN.,In a raven cloak on a haunted road.
604,THE MOONMEN.,
605,THE MOONMEN.,"The Sound of Water, a witch who crooned"
606,THE MOONMEN.,Her spells to the rocks the rain had runed.
607,THE MOONMEN.,
608,THE MOONMEN.,And the Gleam of the Dew on the fern's green tip
609,THE MOONMEN.,Was a sylvan passing with robe a-drip.
610,THE MOONMEN.,
611,THE MOONMEN.,The Light of the Stars was a glimmering maid
612,THE MOONMEN.,"Who stole, an elfin, from glade to glade."
613,THE MOONMEN.,
614,THE MOONMEN.,"The Scent of the Woods in the delicate air,"
615,THE MOONMEN.,A wildflower shape with chilly hair.
616,THE MOONMEN.,
617,THE MOONMEN.,"And Silence, a spirit who sat alone"
618,THE MOONMEN.,With a lifted finger and eyes of stone.
619,THE MOONMEN.,
620,THE MOONMEN.,And it seemed to me these six were met
621,THE MOONMEN.,To greet a greater who came not yet.
622,THE MOONMEN.,
623,THE MOONMEN.,"And the speech they spoke, that I listened to,"
624,THE MOONMEN.,Was the archetype of the speech I knew.
625,THE MOONMEN.,
626,THE MOONMEN.,"For the Wind clasped hands with the Water's rush,"

628,THE MOONMEN.,
629,THE MOONMEN.,The Light of the Stars and the Dew's cool gleam

637,THE MOONMEN.,
638,THE MOONMEN.,And I stood expectant and seemed to hear
639,THE MOONMEN.,A visible music drawing near.
640,THE MOONMEN.,
641,THE MOONMEN.,And the first who came was the Captain Moon
642,THE MOONMEN.,Bearing a shield in GOD'S House hewn.
643,THE MOONMEN.,
644,THE MOONMEN.,"Then an Army of glamour, a glittering Host,"
645,THE MOONMEN.,Beleaguered the night from coast to coast.

651,THE MOONMEN.,Smiting their harps of silver and flame.
