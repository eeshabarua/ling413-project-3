262,BETWEEN TWO RAINS,Beyond the curving shore a gull complains;

418,THE NYMPH,"Before high Jove, the gift of souls we prayed."
419,THE NYMPH,
420,THE NYMPH,Whereat he said: “O perfect as new leaves
421,THE NYMPH,New glossed and veined with blood of perfect days
422,THE NYMPH,"And stirred to murmured speech in fragrant eves,"
423,THE NYMPH,
424,THE NYMPH,"“Still ask ye souls? Behold, I give instead"
425,THE NYMPH,"Into each breast a bird with fettered wings,"
426,THE NYMPH,A bird fast holden with a silken thread:
427,THE NYMPH,
428,THE NYMPH,"“To fall from trial of flight with strength swift spent,"
429,THE NYMPH,"To sing of mating and the brooding grass,"
430,THE NYMPH,To turn thy being earthward to content.”
431,THE NYMPH,
432,THE NYMPH,"Within me sudden wrath and terror strove,"
433,THE NYMPH,"And, casting forth his gift I cried aloud:"
434,THE NYMPH,"“I pray thee for a soul in truth, great Jove!”"
435,THE NYMPH,
436,THE NYMPH,"Then smiled he slowly, lifting to my look"

439,THE NYMPH,
440,THE NYMPH,"All prism-hued, as upward eyes may see"
441,THE NYMPH,The sun through dazzled lashes. Straight I cried:
442,THE NYMPH,"“I know not this!” “Thy soul,” he answered me."
443,THE NYMPH,
444,THE NYMPH,"But when my joy had seized it, “Nay,” he said,"
445,THE NYMPH,And cast it gleaming to the scattering wind--
446,THE NYMPH,"Hues green and golden, blue and fervent red."
447,THE NYMPH,
448,THE NYMPH,Within his hand the brightest shred of all--
449,THE NYMPH,The very heart and secret of the web--
450,THE NYMPH,That held he fast and loosed he not at all;
451,THE NYMPH,
452,THE NYMPH,But to me said: “O thou who scorned the dole
453,THE NYMPH,"That gave thee peace of days and long content,"
454,THE NYMPH,Do now _my_ will. Go forth and find thy soul.”
455,THE NYMPH,
456,THE NYMPH,"To earth we went, nor knew I from that hour"
457,THE NYMPH,My sister’s joy or pain; but on great morns
458,THE NYMPH,"When low light slept above a world in flower,"
459,THE NYMPH,
460,THE NYMPH,Through drowsing noons where heat and color lie
461,THE NYMPH,"In ever wavering tides of airy seas,"

463,THE NYMPH,
464,THE NYMPH,"Through these and twilight peace I went, and rid"
465,THE NYMPH,My steps of comrades. Lonely must I find
466,THE NYMPH,The silent places where my soul was hid.
467,THE NYMPH,
468,THE NYMPH,In sheltered ways with summer showers sweet
469,THE NYMPH,"I wandered on a day, and singing found"
470,THE NYMPH,The very green I sought beneath my feet.
471,THE NYMPH,
472,THE NYMPH,"In leafing forests when the year was new,"
473,THE NYMPH,"And heaven ribboned in the crossing boughs,"
474,THE NYMPH,I gathered marvelous strip on strip of blue.
475,THE NYMPH,
476,THE NYMPH,"When on a lonely stream the moon was bright,"
477,THE NYMPH,A Naiad from her treasure plucked me forth
478,THE NYMPH,Such gold as bound my web with threads of light.
479,THE NYMPH,
480,THE NYMPH,"And red. Ah, love! thou knowest how I came"
481,THE NYMPH,"Unto thy fluting in the breathless eve,"
482,THE NYMPH,And burned my heart’s pale flower to scarlet flame!...
483,THE NYMPH,
484,THE NYMPH,One morn I found within a drop of dew
485,THE NYMPH,My very soul: a crystal world it was
486,THE NYMPH,Wherein the varied earth and heaven’s blue
487,THE NYMPH,
488,THE NYMPH,And myself gazing glassed in perfect sphere--
489,THE NYMPH,"But long above it was my wonder bent,"
490,THE NYMPH,And lo! it dried more swiftly than a tear.
491,THE NYMPH,
492,THE NYMPH,"Now is this truth, O Jove, that I have won"
493,THE NYMPH,And woven all the shreds thou gav’st the wind?
494,THE NYMPH,"But how, I pray thee, can my task be done"
495,THE NYMPH,
496,THE NYMPH,"Unless thou ope thine hand, unless thou loose"
497,THE NYMPH,The very heart and secret of the web
498,THE NYMPH,Where every thread may end and know its use?
499,THE NYMPH,
500,THE NYMPH,"Joy hast thou not withheld, nor love denied,"
501,THE NYMPH,"Nor any beauty dimmed on earth or sky,"
502,THE NYMPH,Yet by thy will I roam unsatisfied.
503,THE NYMPH,
504,THE NYMPH,"But couldst thou hear again that earliest plea,"
505,THE NYMPH,"Again my choice would flout the lesser gift,"
506,THE NYMPH,And willing take this task thou grantest me--
507,THE NYMPH,
508,THE NYMPH,"To search the heart and secret of the whole,"
509,THE NYMPH,"To twine the eager hues of varied days,"
510,THE NYMPH,And to its bright perfection weave a soul.

800,THE CHAPEL,(José would have me pray their prayers).
801,THE CHAPEL,"Now, Mary, warm and all alive,"
802,THE CHAPEL,You shall not think me child of theirs.
803,THE CHAPEL,
804,THE CHAPEL,So many waxen prayers you heard!

806,THE CHAPEL,"With boughs that knew the nesting bird,"
807,THE CHAPEL,"With flowers that bloomed against the sky,"
808,THE CHAPEL,

810,THE CHAPEL,"In vivid question, swift surmise--"

820,THE GARDEN,"A drift of Vestals slim and tall,"
821,THE GARDEN,"That lined these winding paths with white,"
822,THE GARDEN,That filled the court from wall to wall.
823,THE GARDEN,
824,THE GARDEN,"They shrank from savage, splendid heat,"
825,THE GARDEN,As from their teasing fires of Hell--
826,THE GARDEN,Only when morns and eves were sweet
827,THE GARDEN,They walked and liked their garden well.
828,THE GARDEN,
829,THE GARDEN,"Slow moving through a pallid mist,"
830,THE GARDEN,"Always in black, in black they came,"
831,THE GARDEN,With busy rosary on wrist ...
832,THE GARDEN,And all the summer world aflame!
833,THE GARDEN,

835,THE GARDEN,"I brought them in from field and stream,"
836,THE GARDEN,I passed not by the smallest one
837,THE GARDEN,That pleased me with a yellow gleam;
838,THE GARDEN,Then in a hidden chest I found
839,THE GARDEN,The marvel of an old brocade--
840,THE GARDEN,"Strange figures on an azure ground,"
841,THE GARDEN,"With threads of crimson overlaid,"
842,THE GARDEN,
843,THE GARDEN,"And when the noon is fierce and bright,"
844,THE GARDEN,"Along the garden, fold on fold,"

853,IV,There came a poignant sweetness blown
854,IV,From sleeping leagues of orange bloom.
855,IV,
856,IV,And lo! the steady candles blurred
857,IV,"Like shining fishes in a net,"
858,IV,And José’s kindly voice I heard--
859,IV,"“But little one, thine eyes are wet.”"
860,IV,
861,IV,"He vowed the tale had made me weep,"
862,IV,"Its shadowy woes in courtly speech,"
863,IV,Nor knew they passed like wraiths of sleep
864,IV,The heart a vagrant wind could reach.
865,IV,
866,IV,"How can I tell, whose fancy floats"
867,IV,"As swift and passionate impulse veers,"

869,IV,Adown a sudden tide of tears?

878,V,
879,V,Now walk alone the night and I
880,V,"On foaming reaches curving stark,"
881,V,And battling with a windy sky
882,V,The stormy moon is bright and dark.
883,V,
884,V,"Facing the sea with streaming hair,"
885,V,"My broken singing flung behind,"
886,V,Whipped by the keen exultant air
887,V,"Till lips must close and eyes are blind,"
888,V,
889,V,"Loving the sharp and cruel spray,"

905,VI,"Or answers to the calling night,"

907,VI,"They curb when I would dance, would dance!"
908,VI,"By all the graven Saints, it seems"
909,VI,Most strange they make for my mischance
910,VI,No grim confessional of dreams!
911,VI,
912,VI,The flower of Heart’s Desire is sown
913,VI,"In fields unknown to waking sight,"
914,VI,"Down glittering spaces, all alone"
915,VI,I whirl the fire of my delight--

929,VII,
930,VII,"José may journey, never I."
931,VII,In all the lonely hours I spend
932,VII,He bids me tell my beads and sigh....
933,VII,I wonder if the Saints attend?
934,VII,
935,VII,"For when the moon is small and thin,"
936,VII,"And night is fragrant on the land,"
937,VII,The earth and I are so akin
938,VII,I think no Saint could understand.
939,VII,
940,VII,Something within me sleeps by day;
941,VII,To moon and wind its petals part....
942,VII,It is not for my soul I pray;
943,VII,Ah Virgin!--for my untried heart.

957,I,
958,I,"Now ferns there were, and fretted sun above:"
959,I,"I plunged me where the silver water fell,"
960,I,But could not drown the little singing love--
961,I,The little love that murmured like a shell.
962,I,
963,I,"Swift, swift, to drink my freedom at its flood,"
964,I,"I ran with flying feet and lips apart,"

974,II,Below the vaulted window where I kneel.
975,II,
976,II,"He sings, he sings, to stars and listening skies."
977,II,A white and haunted place my garden seems.--
978,II,I see the pleading beauty of his eyes
979,II,As faces glimmer in a pool of dreams.
980,II,
981,II,So wooing wind might sweep a harp awake.
982,II,"(Oh, muting fingers on each quivering string!)"
983,II,I must not yield ... I think my heart will break.

993,III,
994,III,"It is the girlhood dream I leave behind,"
995,III,And sweeter vision never witched a maid.
996,III,Into the threatening shades I wander blind:
997,III,"Ah, Mary, help me now! I am afraid."
998,III,
999,III,Yet with my fears I sway and follow still;
1000,III,"The doorway gleams, the pleading magic charms,"
1001,III,"Step after step, with fluttering breath and will--"

1012,IV,"Before a sleeping flower uncurled,"
1013,IV,"Before the early winds were born,"
1014,IV,"I woke for joy in such a world,"
1015,IV,And with the linnets shared the morn.
1016,IV,
1017,IV,"Remembering love, I woke and smiled,"
1018,IV,"And heard the morning linnets sing,"
1019,IV,"And sang for love, and they for wild"

1035,V,I would not have them understand
1036,V,"The hidden thoughts that give me grace,"
1037,V,"Nor guess the lights that dreams have fanned,"
1038,V,And read their shining in my face.
1039,V,
1040,V,But all my heart the Virgin knows.
1041,V,"Before her eyes, so wise they were,"

1050,VI,"What sun that warmed its shielding glove,--"
1051,VI,"What long blind eve that gave it dew,"
1052,VI,
1053,VI,Could tell that hueless folded thing
1054,VI,"Of shining texture silken-loomed,"
1055,VI,Or say what marveling birds would sing
1056,VI,The morning that it thrilled and bloomed?
1057,VI,
1058,VI,Always it knew in groping thought
1059,VI,"Some end would come, some bloom must be,"
1060,VI,The blind fulfilment that it wrought
1061,VI,Was strained from darkness restlessly;
1062,VI,
1063,VI,Till exquisite completion willed
1064,VI,"The answered bud, the dream put by,"

1074,VII,The sun has lulled me half asleep.
1075,VII,
1076,VII,And all beneath my breath I sing ...
1077,VII,This joy of mine is sweet to hold!
1078,VII,Such treasure had the miser king
1079,VII,Who brushed the very dew to gold.
1080,VII,
1081,VII,Deep in the sunny grass I lie

1098,I,
1099,I,One time the hands of wind upon my hair
1100,I,Could heal me like a mother’s touch and kiss.
1101,I,When I could give my airy griefs to air
1102,I,I never knew so sharp a thorn as this.
1103,I,
1104,I,The joy of flower and wind and sighing bough--
1105,I,It comes not back again for tears and rue.

1115,II,That long-forgotten country whence he came.
1116,II,
1117,II,Calls to him past my words; beyond my eyes
1118,II,"Lost waters shine, remembered sunsets die."
1119,II,"Ay, in my kiss another mouth replies,"
1120,II,"And speaks of kisses past, of lips put by."
1121,II,
1122,II,"Now this my heart divines, for words of love"
1123,II,He gives me still (O woeful heart and bruised

1134,III,
1135,III,But all of love that I could touch and know
1136,III,"I held as one a lamp that makes his day,"
1137,III,"And touch it still, and see its flame burn low,"
1138,III,Its shining figures fade to painted clay.
1139,III,
1140,III,"Ah, I would hold the semblance, keep the kiss;"
1141,III,"But watching in its heart the paling spark,"

1154,IV,"Is happy earth, for once it knew love’s feet;"
1155,IV,"Here once love stood and called the heart that heard,"

1160,IV,And heap the happy earth upon the face
1161,IV,That has no will to smile nor breath to sigh.

1855,YESTERDAY[8],Seen whitely through an emerald--

1857,YESTERDAY[8],"And dreamed the light and you were one,"
