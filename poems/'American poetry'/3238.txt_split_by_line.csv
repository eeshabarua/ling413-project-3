165,WORTH WHILE,It is easy enough to be pleasant
166,WORTH WHILE,"When life flows by like a song,"
167,WORTH WHILE,But the man worth while is the one who will smile
168,WORTH WHILE,When everything goes dead wrong.
169,WORTH WHILE,"For the test of the heart is trouble,"
170,WORTH WHILE,"And it always comes with the years,"
171,WORTH WHILE,And the smile that is worth the praises of earth
172,WORTH WHILE,Is the smile that shines through tears.

174,WORTH WHILE,It is easy enough to be prudent
175,WORTH WHILE,"When nothing tempts you to stray,"
176,WORTH WHILE,When without or within no voice of sin
177,WORTH WHILE,Is luring your soul away;
178,WORTH WHILE,But it’s only a negative virtue
179,WORTH WHILE,"Until it is tried by fire,"
180,WORTH WHILE,And the life that is worth the honour on earth
181,WORTH WHILE,Is the one that resists desire.
182,WORTH WHILE,
183,WORTH WHILE,"By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,"
184,WORTH WHILE,"Who had no strength for the strife,"
185,WORTH WHILE,The world’s highway is cumbered to-day—
186,WORTH WHILE,They make up the sum of life;
187,WORTH WHILE,"But the virtue that conquers passion,"
188,WORTH WHILE,And the sorrow that hides in a smile—
189,WORTH WHILE,"It is these that are worth the homage on earth,"
190,WORTH WHILE,For we find them but once in a while.

197,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
198,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"All wondering, and eager-eyed, within her portico"
199,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"I made my plea to Hostess Life, one morning long ago."
200,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
201,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"“Pray show me this great house of thine, nor close a single door;"

212,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
213,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,And then a door whereon the one word “Happiness” was writ;
214,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,But when I tried the little key I could not make it fit.

216,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"It turned the lock of Pleasure’s room, where first all seemed so"
217,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,bright—
218,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,But after I had stayed awhile it somehow lost its light.
219,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
220,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"And wandering down a lonely hall, I came upon a room"
221,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"Marked “Duty,” and I entered it—to lose myself in gloom."
222,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
223,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"Along the shadowy halls I groped my weary way about,"
224,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"And found that from dull Duty’s room, a door of Toil led out."
225,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
226,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"It led out to another door, whereon a crimson stain"
227,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,Made sullenly against the dark these words: “The Room of Pain.”
228,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
229,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"But oh the light, the light, the light, that spilled down from above"
230,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"And upward wound, the stairs of Faith, right to the Tower of Love!"
231,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,
232,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,"And when I came forth from that place, I tried the little key—"

406,TWO SUNSETS,"In the fair morning of his life,"
407,TWO SUNSETS,"When his pure heart lay in his breast,"
408,TWO SUNSETS,"Panting, with all that wild unrest"
409,TWO SUNSETS,To plunge into the great world’s strife
410,TWO SUNSETS,
411,TWO SUNSETS,"That fills young hearts with mad desire,"
412,TWO SUNSETS,He saw a sunset.  Red and gold
413,TWO SUNSETS,"The burning billows surged and rolled,"
414,TWO SUNSETS,And upward tossed their caps of fire.
415,TWO SUNSETS,
416,TWO SUNSETS,"He looked.  And as he looked, the sight"
417,TWO SUNSETS,Sent from his soul through breast and brain
418,TWO SUNSETS,"Such intense joy, it hurt like pain."
419,TWO SUNSETS,His heart seemed bursting with delight.
420,TWO SUNSETS,
421,TWO SUNSETS,"So near the Unknown seemed, so close"
422,TWO SUNSETS,He might have grasped it with his hands
423,TWO SUNSETS,"He felt his inmost soul expand,"
424,TWO SUNSETS,As sunlight will expand a rose
425,TWO SUNSETS,
426,TWO SUNSETS,One day he heard a singing strain—
427,TWO SUNSETS,"A human voice, in bird-like trills."
428,TWO SUNSETS,"He paused, and little rapture-rills"
429,TWO SUNSETS,Went trickling downward through each vein.
430,TWO SUNSETS,
431,TWO SUNSETS,"And in his heart the whole day long,"
432,TWO SUNSETS,"As in a temple veiled and dim,"
433,TWO SUNSETS,He kept and bore about with him
434,TWO SUNSETS,The beauty of that singer’s song.
435,TWO SUNSETS,
436,TWO SUNSETS,And then?  But why relate what then?
437,TWO SUNSETS,His smouldering heart flamed into fire—
438,TWO SUNSETS,"He had his one supreme desire,"
439,TWO SUNSETS,And plunged into the world of men.
440,TWO SUNSETS,
441,TWO SUNSETS,For years queen Folly held her sway.
442,TWO SUNSETS,With pleasures of the grosser kind
443,TWO SUNSETS,"She fed his flesh and drugged his mind,"
444,TWO SUNSETS,"Till, shamed, he sated, turned away."
445,TWO SUNSETS,
446,TWO SUNSETS,He sought his boyhood’s home.
447,TWO SUNSETS,"That hour Triumphant should have been, in sooth,"
448,TWO SUNSETS,"Since he went forth, an unknown youth,"
449,TWO SUNSETS,And came back crowned with wealth and power.
450,TWO SUNSETS,
451,TWO SUNSETS,The clouds made day a gorgeous bed;
452,TWO SUNSETS,He saw the splendour of the sky
453,TWO SUNSETS,With unmoved heart and stolid eye;
454,TWO SUNSETS,He only knew the West was red.
455,TWO SUNSETS,
456,TWO SUNSETS,Then suddenly a fresh young voice
457,TWO SUNSETS,"Rose, bird-like, from some hidden place,"
458,TWO SUNSETS,He did not even turn his face—
459,TWO SUNSETS,It struck him simply as a noise.
460,TWO SUNSETS,
461,TWO SUNSETS,He trod the old paths up and down.
462,TWO SUNSETS,Their rich-hued leaves by Fall winds whirled—
463,TWO SUNSETS,How dull they were—how dull the world—
464,TWO SUNSETS,Dull even in the pulsing town.
465,TWO SUNSETS,
466,TWO SUNSETS,"O! worst of punishments, that brings"
467,TWO SUNSETS,"A blunting of all finer sense,"
468,TWO SUNSETS,"A loss of feelings keen, intense,"
469,TWO SUNSETS,And dulls us to the higher things.
470,TWO SUNSETS,
471,TWO SUNSETS,"O! penalty most dire, most sure,"
472,TWO SUNSETS,"Swift following after gross delights,"
473,TWO SUNSETS,"That we no more see beauteous sights,"
474,TWO SUNSETS,Or hear as hear the good and pure.
475,TWO SUNSETS,
476,TWO SUNSETS,O! shape more hideous and more dread
477,TWO SUNSETS,"Than Vengeance takes in creed-taught minds,"
478,TWO SUNSETS,"This certain doom that blunts and blinds,"
479,TWO SUNSETS,And strikes the holiest feelings dead.

1171,RETROSPECTION,By fingers of amorous noon.
1172,RETROSPECTION,
1173,RETROSPECTION,A turn in the pathway of duty—
1174,RETROSPECTION,"I stood in the perfect day’s prime,"
1175,RETROSPECTION,"Close, close to the hillside of beauty"
1176,RETROSPECTION,The Voice from the Silence said “Climb”
1177,RETROSPECTION,
1178,RETROSPECTION,The road to the beautiful Regions
1179,RETROSPECTION,Lies ever through Duty’s hard way.

1189,HELENA,Last night I saw Helena.  She whose praise
1190,HELENA,Of late all men have sounded.  She for whom
1191,HELENA,Young Angus rashly sought a silent tomb
1192,HELENA,Rather than live without her all his days.
1193,HELENA,
1194,HELENA,"Wise men go mad who look upon her long,"
1195,HELENA,She is so ripe with dangers.  Yet meanwhile
1196,HELENA,"I find no fascination in her smile,"
1197,HELENA,Although I make her theme of this poor song.
1198,HELENA,
1199,HELENA,"“Her golden tresses?” yes, they may be fair,"
1200,HELENA,And yet to me each shining silken tress
1201,HELENA,Seems robbed of beauty and all lustreless—
1202,HELENA,Too many hands have stroked Helena’s hair.
1203,HELENA,
1204,HELENA,(I know a little maiden so demure
1205,HELENA,She will not let her one true lover’s hands
1206,HELENA,In playful fondness touch her soft brown bands
1207,HELENA,"So dainty-minded is she, and so pure.)"
1208,HELENA,
1209,HELENA,“Her great dark eyes that flash like gems at night?
1210,HELENA,"Large, long-lashed eyes and lustrous?” that may be,"
1211,HELENA,And yet they are not beautiful to me.
1212,HELENA,Too many hearts have sunned in their delight.
1213,HELENA,
1214,HELENA,"(I mind me of two tender blue eyes, hid"
1215,HELENA,"So underneath white curtains, and so veiled"
1216,HELENA,"That I have sometimes plead for hours, and failed"
1217,HELENA,To see more than the shyly lifted lid.)
1218,HELENA,
1219,HELENA,“Her perfect mouth so liked a carved kiss?”
1220,HELENA,"“Her honeyed-mouth, where hearts do, fly-like, drown?”"
1221,HELENA,I would not taste its sweetness for a crown;
1222,HELENA,Too many lips have drank its nectared bliss.
1223,HELENA,
1224,HELENA,"(I know a mouth whose virgin dew, undried,"
1225,HELENA,"Lies like a young grape’s bloom, untouched and sweet,"
1226,HELENA,"And though I plead in passion at her feet,"
1227,HELENA,She would not let me brush it if I died.)
1228,HELENA,
1229,HELENA,"In vain, Helena! though wise men may vie"
1230,HELENA,"For thy rare smile, or die from loss of it,"
1231,HELENA,"Armoured by my sweet lady’s trust, I sit,"
1232,HELENA,And know thou are not worth her faintest sigh.

1690,AND THEY ARE DUMB,Of Youth’s story.
1691,AND THEY ARE DUMB,
1692,AND THEY ARE DUMB,It was but a dreamer’s journey of the brain;

1725,NIGHT,But silently from daylight and from din
1726,NIGHT,"The sweet Night draws me—whispers, “Look within!”"
1727,NIGHT,"And looking, as one wakened from a dream,"

1730,NIGHT,"The Night says, “Listen!” and upon my ear"
1731,NIGHT,"Revealed, as are the visions to my sight,"

1733,NIGHT,And whisper of the vastly Infinite.
1734,NIGHT,"Great, blue-eyed Truth, her sister Purity,"
1735,NIGHT,"Their brother Honour, all converse with me,"

1743,NIGHT,"The Slumberland, made beautiful and bright"
1744,NIGHT,"As death, by dreams of loved ones gone from sight,"

2388,A REMINISCENCE,"And _you_ seemed so tiny, and _I_ felt so tall."

2561,A LEAF,"That you were married, or soon to be."
2562,A LEAF,"I have not thought of you, I believe,"
2563,A LEAF,Since last we parted.  Let me see:
2564,A LEAF,Five long Summers have passed since then—
2565,A LEAF,Each has been pleasant in its own way—
2566,A LEAF,And you are but one of a dozen men
2567,A LEAF,Who have played the suitor a Summer day.
2568,A LEAF,
2569,A LEAF,"But, nevertheless, when I heard your name,"
2570,A LEAF,"Coupled with some one’s, not my own,"
2571,A LEAF,"There burned in my bosom a sudden flame,"

2575,A LEAF,And my heart was fluttering under your look—
2576,A LEAF,The unmistakable look of Love.
2577,A LEAF,
2578,A LEAF,"Again your breath, like a South wind, fanned"
2579,A LEAF,"My cheek, where the blushes came and went;"
2580,A LEAF,"And the tender clasp of your strong, warm hand"
2581,A LEAF,Sudden thrills through my pulses sent.
2582,A LEAF,Again you were mine by Love’s own right—
2583,A LEAF,Mine for ever by Love’s decree:
2584,A LEAF,"So for a moment it seemed last night,"
2585,A LEAF,When somebody mentioned your name to me.
2586,A LEAF,
2587,A LEAF,Just for the moment I thought you mine—
2588,A LEAF,"Loving me, wooing me, as of old."

2601,ÆSTHETIC,
2602,ÆSTHETIC,In a garb that was guiltless of colours
2603,ÆSTHETIC,"She stood, with a dull, listless air—"
2604,ÆSTHETIC,"A creature of dumps and of dolours,"
2605,ÆSTHETIC,But most undeniably fair.
2606,ÆSTHETIC,
2607,ÆSTHETIC,"The folds of her garment fell round her,"
2608,ÆSTHETIC,Revealing the curve of each limb;
2609,ÆSTHETIC,"Well proportioned and graceful I found her,"
2610,ÆSTHETIC,Although quite alarmingly slim.
2611,ÆSTHETIC,
2612,ÆSTHETIC,From the hem of her robe peeped one sandal—
2613,ÆSTHETIC,“High art” was she down to her feet;
2614,ÆSTHETIC,And though I could not understand all
2615,ÆSTHETIC,"She said, I could see she was sweet."
2616,ÆSTHETIC,
2617,ÆSTHETIC,"Impressed by her limpness and languor,"
2618,ÆSTHETIC,I proffered a chair near at hand;
2619,ÆSTHETIC,She looked back a mild sort of anger—
2620,ÆSTHETIC,"Posed anew, and continued to stand."
2621,ÆSTHETIC,
2622,ÆSTHETIC,Some praises I next tried to mutter
2623,ÆSTHETIC,Of the fan that she held to her face;
2624,ÆSTHETIC,"She said it was “utterly utter,”"
2625,ÆSTHETIC,And waved it with languishing grace.
2626,ÆSTHETIC,
2627,ÆSTHETIC,"I then, in a strain quite poetic,"
2628,ÆSTHETIC,"Begged her gaze on the bow in the sky,"
2629,ÆSTHETIC,She looked—said its curve was “æsthetic.”
2630,ÆSTHETIC,But the “tone was too dreadfully high.”
2631,ÆSTHETIC,
2632,ÆSTHETIC,"Her lovely face, lit by the splendour"
2633,ÆSTHETIC,"That glorified landscape and sea,"
2634,ÆSTHETIC,Woke thoughts that were daring and tender:
2635,ÆSTHETIC,"Did _her_ thoughts, too, rest upon me?"
2636,ÆSTHETIC,
2637,ÆSTHETIC,"“Oh, tell me,” I cried, growing bolder,"
2638,ÆSTHETIC,“Have I in your musings a place?”
2639,ÆSTHETIC,"“Well, yes,” she said over her shoulder:"

3085,AQUILEIA,"Aquileia.  Though poorly prepared for war, the constancy of her citizens"
3086,AQUILEIA,rendered her impregnable.  The women of Aquileia cut off their hair to
3087,AQUILEIA,make ropes for the military engines.  The small body of troops was
3088,AQUILEIA,"directed by Chrispinus, a Lieutenant of the Senate.  Apollo was the deity"

3091,AQUILEIA,"“The ropes, the ropes!  Apollo send us ropes,”"

3095,AQUILEIA,
3096,AQUILEIA,Up rose a Roman mother; tall was she
3097,AQUILEIA,"As her own son, a youth of noble height."
3098,AQUILEIA,A little child was clinging to her knee—
3099,AQUILEIA,"She loosed his twining arms and put him down,"

3102,AQUILEIA,"How like a queen she stood! her royal crown,"
3103,AQUILEIA,The rich dark masses of her splendid hair.
3104,AQUILEIA,"Just flecked with spots of sunshine here and there,"
3105,AQUILEIA,"Twined round her brow; ’twas like a coronet,"
3106,AQUILEIA,Where gems of gold lie bedded deep in jet.
3107,AQUILEIA,
3108,AQUILEIA,"She loosed the comb that held the shining strands,"
3109,AQUILEIA,And threaded out the meshes with her hands.

3118,AQUILEIA,"Awed by her regal bearing, and obeyed."
3119,AQUILEIA,
3120,AQUILEIA,With the white beauty of her firm fair hand

3123,AQUILEIA,"Free e’en as foes had fallen by that blade,"
3124,AQUILEIA,"Robbed of its massive wealth of curl and coil,"
3125,AQUILEIA,"Yet like some antique model, rose her head"
3126,AQUILEIA,In all its classic beauty.
3127,AQUILEIA,
3128,AQUILEIA,"“See!” she said,"
3129,AQUILEIA,And pointed to the shining mound of hair;

3131,AQUILEIA,"Chrispinus.  Quick! now, soldiers, to thy toil!”"
3132,AQUILEIA,Forth from a thousand throats what seemed one voice
3133,AQUILEIA,"Rose shrilly, filling all the air with cheer."
3134,AQUILEIA,"“Lo!” quoth the foe, “our enemies rejoice!”"
3135,AQUILEIA,Well might the Thracian giant quake with fear!
3136,AQUILEIA,For while skilled hands caught up the gleaming threads
3137,AQUILEIA,"And bound them into cords, a hundred heads"
3138,AQUILEIA,"Yielded their beauteous tresses to the sword,"
3139,AQUILEIA,And cast them down to swell the precious hoard.

3262,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3263,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Auntie says, with manner grave,"
3264,A GIRL’S REVERIE,“Wife is synonym for slave.”
3265,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3266,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Father asks, in tones commanding,"
3267,A GIRL’S REVERIE,“How does Bradstreet rate his standing?”
3268,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3269,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Sister crooning to her twins,"
3270,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Sighs, “With marriage care begins.”"

3272,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Grandma, near life’s closing days,"
3273,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Murmurs, “Sweet are girlhood’s ways.”"
3274,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3275,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"Maud, twice widowed (“sod and grass”)"
3276,A GIRL’S REVERIE,Looks at me and moans “Alas!”
3277,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3278,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"They are six, and I am one,"
3279,A GIRL’S REVERIE,Life for me has just begun.
3280,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3281,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"They are older, calmer, wiser:"
3282,A GIRL’S REVERIE,Age should aye be youth’s adviser.
3283,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3284,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"They must know—and yet, dear me,"
3285,A GIRL’S REVERIE,When in Harry’s eyes I see
3286,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3287,A GIRL’S REVERIE,All the world of love there burning—
3288,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"On my six advisers turning,"
3289,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3290,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"I make answer, “Oh, but Harry"
3291,A GIRL’S REVERIE,Is not like most men who marry.
3292,A GIRL’S REVERIE,
3293,A GIRL’S REVERIE,"“Fate has offered me a prize,"
3294,A GIRL’S REVERIE,Life with love means Paradise.

3305,AN AFTERNOON,AN AFTERNOON
3306,AN AFTERNOON,
3307,AN AFTERNOON,
3308,AN AFTERNOON,I am stirred by the dream of an afternoon
3309,AN AFTERNOON,Of a perfect day—though it was not June;
3310,AN AFTERNOON,"The lilt of winds, and the droning tune"
3311,AN AFTERNOON,That a busy city was humming.
3312,AN AFTERNOON,
3313,AN AFTERNOON,"And a bronze-brown head, and lips like wine"
3314,AN AFTERNOON,Leaning out through the window-vine
3315,AN AFTERNOON,A-list for steps that were maybe mine—
3316,AN AFTERNOON,Eager steps that were coming.
3317,AN AFTERNOON,
3318,AN AFTERNOON,"I can see it all, as a dreamer may—"
3319,AN AFTERNOON,"The tender smile on your lips that day,"
3320,AN AFTERNOON,And the glow on your cheek as we rode away
3321,AN AFTERNOON,Into the golden weather.
3322,AN AFTERNOON,
3323,AN AFTERNOON,And a love-light shone in your eyes of brown—
3324,AN AFTERNOON,I swear there did!—as we drove down
3325,AN AFTERNOON,"The crowded avenue out of the town,"
3326,AN AFTERNOON,"Through shadowy lanes, together:"
3327,AN AFTERNOON,
3328,AN AFTERNOON,Drove out into the sunset-skies
3329,AN AFTERNOON,That glowed with wonderful crimson dyes;
3330,AN AFTERNOON,"And with soul and spirit, and heart and eyes,"
3331,AN AFTERNOON,We silently drank their splendour.
3332,AN AFTERNOON,
3333,AN AFTERNOON,But the golden glory that lit the place
3334,AN AFTERNOON,Was not alone from the sunset’s grace—
3335,AN AFTERNOON,"For I saw in your fair, uplifted face"
3336,AN AFTERNOON,A light that was wondrously tender.
3337,AN AFTERNOON,
3338,AN AFTERNOON,I say I saw it.  And yet to-day
3339,AN AFTERNOON,"I ask myself, in a cynical way,"
3340,AN AFTERNOON,"Was it only a part you had learned to play,"
3341,AN AFTERNOON,To see me act the lover?
3342,AN AFTERNOON,
3343,AN AFTERNOON,And I curse myself for a fool.  And yet
3344,AN AFTERNOON,I would willingly die without one regret
3345,AN AFTERNOON,Could I bring back the day whose sun has set—
3346,AN AFTERNOON,And you—and live it over.
3347,AN AFTERNOON,
3348,AN AFTERNOON,

3351,RIVER AND SEA,RIVER AND SEA
3352,RIVER AND SEA,
3353,RIVER AND SEA,
3354,RIVER AND SEA,We stood by the river that swept
3355,RIVER AND SEA,In its glory and grandeur away;
3356,RIVER AND SEA,"But never a pulse o’ me leapt,"
3357,RIVER AND SEA,And you wondered at me that day.
3358,RIVER AND SEA,
3359,RIVER AND SEA,We stood by the lake as it lay
3360,RIVER AND SEA,With its dimpled face turned to the light;
3361,RIVER AND SEA,Was it strange I had nothing to say
3362,RIVER AND SEA,To so fair and enchanting a sight?
3363,RIVER AND SEA,
3364,RIVER AND SEA,I look on your tresses of gold—
3365,RIVER AND SEA,You are fair and a thing to be loved—
3366,RIVER AND SEA,Do you think I am heartless and cold
3367,RIVER AND SEA,That I look and am wholly unmoved?
3368,RIVER AND SEA,
3369,RIVER AND SEA,"One answer, dear friend, I will make"
3370,RIVER AND SEA,To the questions your eyes ask of me:
3371,RIVER AND SEA,“Talk not of the river or lake
3372,RIVER AND SEA,To those who have looked on the sea”
3373,RIVER AND SEA,

3390,WHAT HAPPENS?,When hands and eyes are hid by seas that roll
