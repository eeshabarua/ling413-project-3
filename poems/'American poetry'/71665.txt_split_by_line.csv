136,BROWN LEAVES,"From the pipes of old Winter, has come a shrill blast,"
137,BROWN LEAVES,And upon the gray earth a pure mantle is cast.
138,BROWN LEAVES,’Tis a garment of snow-flakes come down from the skies
139,BROWN LEAVES,"And beneath it, in silence, the patient earth lies."
140,BROWN LEAVES,
141,BROWN LEAVES,The moaning and rustling of dead leaves is past--
142,BROWN LEAVES,"The comforter came, they are sheltered at last."
143,BROWN LEAVES,"O, brown leaves of autumn! ’Tis a wise hand that leads,"
144,BROWN LEAVES,"And he sends what is best, who best knoweth our needs."
145,BROWN LEAVES,"He gives and he takes, and in taking he gives:"
146,BROWN LEAVES,"From life cometh death, and in dying we live."
147,BROWN LEAVES,"From mists of the river, the brooklet and sea"
148,BROWN LEAVES,"This beautiful shroud has been woven, and ye"
149,BROWN LEAVES,"Of its coming wist not, for from out the still air"
150,BROWN LEAVES,It as silently fell as an answer to prayer.
151,BROWN LEAVES,"O, could ye but creep from your coverlet white"
152,BROWN LEAVES,"And visit your home, a most wonderful sight"
153,BROWN LEAVES,"Would gladden your hearts, for the sun met the snow,"
154,BROWN LEAVES,"And the frost followed on with his cold breath, and lo!"
155,BROWN LEAVES,Your home is a palace of crystal more bright
156,BROWN LEAVES,Than Aladdin beheld with his magical light.
157,BROWN LEAVES,
158,BROWN LEAVES,Ye glow and ye fade--but as wondrous to me
159,BROWN LEAVES,Is the leaf on the ground as the leaf on the tree:
160,BROWN LEAVES,For links in time’s chain clasp eternity fast
161,BROWN LEAVES,And the chain becomes endless. Ever the past
162,BROWN LEAVES,"Pays its debt to the future, leaf-life, or man’s,"
163,BROWN LEAVES,So perfect the system that surely no hands
164,BROWN LEAVES,But of Infinite wisdom and love could be
165,BROWN LEAVES,The author of such an unerring decree.
166,BROWN LEAVES,"Who knoweth the end? Little leaflets, not we!"
167,BROWN LEAVES,"Enough for ourselves, as we hang on life’s tree,"
168,BROWN LEAVES,To gather the sunshine and freely bestow
169,BROWN LEAVES,Our shade to the weary and faint ones below.
170,BROWN LEAVES,"And when we grow brown, as, surely we must,"
171,BROWN LEAVES,The end will be glorious can we but trust
172,BROWN LEAVES,"That the Infinite love, which careth for all,"
173,BROWN LEAVES,Forgets not the little brown leaves when they fall.

191,TO THE DAISIES,With your soft eyes declare:
192,TO THE DAISIES,"What is it makes the roses bloom,"
193,TO THE DAISIES,And beauty everywhere?
194,TO THE DAISIES,Is it the longing in the seed
195,TO THE DAISIES,That speaketh in the flower;
196,TO THE DAISIES,And is this longing satisfied
197,TO THE DAISIES,"To breathe for one short hour,"

199,TO THE DAISIES,"And vanish? Nay: the hidden power,"
200,TO THE DAISIES,In seed-life unto me

203,TO THE DAISIES,"And what though on the silent air,"
204,TO THE DAISIES,The perfume dies away
205,TO THE DAISIES,"Of the June roses, and they fade--"
206,TO THE DAISIES,"Behold! shall any say,"
207,TO THE DAISIES,"However wise, that this is loss:"
208,TO THE DAISIES,Alas! shall any deign
209,TO THE DAISIES,"Deny, that Nature’s wondrous laws"
210,TO THE DAISIES,May not restore again?
211,TO THE DAISIES,"The waves roll in upon the shore,"
212,TO THE DAISIES,"Recede, and come again"
213,TO THE DAISIES,"And thirsty clouds drink in the floods,"
214,TO THE DAISIES,"To give them back, in rain."
215,TO THE DAISIES,"O Daisies, when bright June is past,"
216,TO THE DAISIES,And all your beauty fled;
217,TO THE DAISIES,"If in my memory ye but live,"
218,TO THE DAISIES,"I dare not call ye dead,"

220,TO THE DAISIES,"From whence all beauty springs,"
221,TO THE DAISIES,"Your silence filled my soul with awe,"
222,TO THE DAISIES,And gave my spirit wings.
223,TO THE DAISIES,The self-same tint in morning’s glow
224,TO THE DAISIES,And in the crimson flush
225,TO THE DAISIES,"Of the June roses, I behold"
226,TO THE DAISIES,In timid maidens’ blush.
227,TO THE DAISIES,"O Daisies, listen unto me,"
228,TO THE DAISIES,My secret I impart--
229,TO THE DAISIES,Love’s sweetest flowers are all ablow;
230,TO THE DAISIES,’Tis June-time in my heart!
231,TO THE DAISIES,
232,TO THE DAISIES,"Go tell my secret to some bird,"
233,TO THE DAISIES,The bob-o-link were best--
234,TO THE DAISIES,Tell him to ask his patient wife
235,TO THE DAISIES,To sit upon the nest;
236,TO THE DAISIES,"And him unto my lover go,"
237,TO THE DAISIES,"And, as my minstrel sent,"
238,TO THE DAISIES,Ask him to sing that song he sang
239,TO THE DAISIES,When he a-wooing went.
240,TO THE DAISIES,
241,TO THE DAISIES,Thou think’st he might not find him?
242,TO THE DAISIES,"It might be well to say,"
243,TO THE DAISIES,"My love, like light, will go before"
244,TO THE DAISIES,To ’luminate the way.

275,TO FLORENCE,(On Her Tenth Birthday.)
276,TO FLORENCE,
277,TO FLORENCE,
278,TO FLORENCE,"I am very sad and lonely, dear,"
279,TO FLORENCE,Do you care for what I say?
280,TO FLORENCE,I once had a beautiful baby--
281,TO FLORENCE,But now she has gone away.
282,TO FLORENCE,
283,TO FLORENCE,"To-day I went up to the garret,"
284,TO FLORENCE,And there in a chest I found
285,TO FLORENCE,"Little shirts, little shoes and stockings"
286,TO FLORENCE,And a dainty little gown.
287,TO FLORENCE,
288,TO FLORENCE,Scarcely large enough for your dolly
289,TO FLORENCE,"Are the things she used to wear,--"
290,TO FLORENCE,"Do you know where has gone my baby,"
291,TO FLORENCE,"My baby--with soft, brown hair?"
292,TO FLORENCE,
293,TO FLORENCE,She was such a beautiful baby--
294,TO FLORENCE,"I had thought to keep her so,"
295,TO FLORENCE,But she slipped away with each passing day
296,TO FLORENCE,And I did not see her go.
297,TO FLORENCE,
298,TO FLORENCE,*       *       *       *       *
299,TO FLORENCE,
300,TO FLORENCE,"Then I had a child, as lovely"
301,TO FLORENCE,As my babe had seemed to me;
302,TO FLORENCE,But she is gone and I gaze through tears
303,TO FLORENCE,But her face I may not see.
304,TO FLORENCE,
305,TO FLORENCE,"I remember her childish prattle,"
306,TO FLORENCE,"The wonderful things she’d say,"
307,TO FLORENCE,Her winsome smile and her merry laugh--
308,TO FLORENCE,"Now, why did _she_ go away?"
309,TO FLORENCE,
310,TO FLORENCE,"Her hair was soft as the thistle’s down,"
311,TO FLORENCE,But the sunshine lingered there
312,TO FLORENCE,And wreathed such glory about her brow
313,TO FLORENCE,As I never have seen elsewhere.
314,TO FLORENCE,
315,TO FLORENCE,"In the garret we put her high-chair,"
316,TO FLORENCE,"And saved her rattle and ball,"
317,TO FLORENCE,But she never came back to claim them
318,TO FLORENCE,And all in vain was my call.
319,TO FLORENCE,
320,TO FLORENCE,*       *       *       *       *
321,TO FLORENCE,
322,TO FLORENCE,“I will not go and leave you
323,TO FLORENCE,As the others went away.”
324,TO FLORENCE,"Yes, I hear what you are saying, dear,"
325,TO FLORENCE,That you will be sure to stay.
326,TO FLORENCE,
327,TO FLORENCE,*       *       *       *       *
328,TO FLORENCE,
329,TO FLORENCE,It must be that I was dreaming
330,TO FLORENCE,Of days that have passed away--
331,TO FLORENCE,"What is it, my own little daughter,"
332,TO FLORENCE,"You are ten years old, to-day?"
333,TO FLORENCE,
334,TO FLORENCE,"Yes, nestle up closer, my darling,"
335,TO FLORENCE,"You have banished all my care,--"
336,TO FLORENCE,For you are my beautiful baby
337,TO FLORENCE,And my child with the sunlit hair.
338,TO FLORENCE,
339,TO FLORENCE,"As I look in your soft, brown eyes, dear,"
340,TO FLORENCE,"My baby’s face I see,"
341,TO FLORENCE,"And I know not what to call you, _now_"
342,TO FLORENCE,Save my blessed trinity.

351,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,"Or aught more wonderful in spheres unknown,"
352,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,Than nature’s influence on human life?
353,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,"We go into the open field or wood,"
354,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,"And she is there, and we are thrilled, and feel"
355,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,An ecstacy which words cannot define--
356,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,A touch too delicate for human speech.
357,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,
358,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,"The robin’s song comes floating on the air,"

362,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,And tulips gay and yellow daffodils.
363,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,I stray amid a field of daisy bloom--
364,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,"That all-pervading Presence seems most nigh,"
365,NATURE’S INFLUENCE,The atmosphere they breathe is full of cheer.

411,A VALENTINE,
412,A VALENTINE,
413,A VALENTINE,A Valentine--Now if I might
414,A VALENTINE,But somehow tempt her to alight--
415,A VALENTINE,I mean my Muse--I’d try to say
416,A VALENTINE,"Some word to cheer thy heart, to-day."
417,A VALENTINE,I know the meaning they attach
418,A VALENTINE,To Valentines: but then I’ll scratch
419,A VALENTINE,"That off, and write, as to a friend--"
420,A VALENTINE,"’Tis fair, if so we comprehend."
421,A VALENTINE,"How strange, that certain days and hours,"
422,A VALENTINE,"That certain trees and certain flowers,"
423,A VALENTINE,"Alone possess, as ’twere, a key"
424,A VALENTINE,To certain rooms in memory.
425,A VALENTINE,
426,A VALENTINE,"When but a child, they used to say"
427,A VALENTINE,"That birds, like lovers, went away"
428,A VALENTINE,In search of mates: and even now
429,A VALENTINE,I dimly can remember how
430,A VALENTINE,"Their words I doubted, till one day"
431,A VALENTINE,"Our purple pigeon flew away,"
432,A VALENTINE,"Returned at night, and by his side"
433,A VALENTINE,Fluttered his little snow-white bride.
434,A VALENTINE,And ne’er this day comes ’round to me
435,A VALENTINE,But flutters in my memory
436,A VALENTINE,The purple and the snow-white dove
437,A VALENTINE,Cooing their tender notes of love.
438,A VALENTINE,
439,A VALENTINE,"Some word to cheer thee, did I say?"
440,A VALENTINE,Words--what are words? As helpless they
441,A VALENTINE,As blinded eyes to lead the feet
442,A VALENTINE,"O’er tangled pathways, did they meet"
443,A VALENTINE,"Not some felt need, or if they be"
444,A VALENTINE,Not warm with loving sympathy.
445,A VALENTINE,"If magic were my art, and I"
446,A VALENTINE,Could banish from thine inner sky
447,A VALENTINE,"All clouds of sorrow and of pain,"
448,A VALENTINE,I would not do it. Following rain
449,A VALENTINE,Is brighter sky; at sorrow’s fire
450,A VALENTINE,Our joys are tempered. Mounting higher
451,A VALENTINE,"Than human wish is human need,"
452,A VALENTINE,And wrapped beneath the husks of creed
453,A VALENTINE,"Is what we think, and feel, and know,"
454,A VALENTINE,Of the deep things of God. And so
455,A VALENTINE,My best and only wish shall be
456,A VALENTINE,That thou mayst solve life’s mystery.

462,A SPRING REVERIE,
463,A SPRING REVERIE,
464,A SPRING REVERIE,Winter has at last unlocked the portals of his icy castle and ushered
465,A SPRING REVERIE,into our presence the very queen of all the seasons. Let us fling open
466,A SPRING REVERIE,the doorways of our hearts and give a generous welcome. How silently she
467,A SPRING REVERIE,"moves among us, and yet our finer ear may hear her in the springing"
468,A SPRING REVERIE,grass and opening blossoms. We feel her magic touch in everything about
469,A SPRING REVERIE,"us. She whispers, and the slumbering earth awakes to new life and"
470,A SPRING REVERIE,beauty. Would we might sing her praises with hearts as full as the
471,A SPRING REVERIE,"happy, joyous birds."
472,A SPRING REVERIE,
473,A SPRING REVERIE,"I wonder, if we would, we could not make our daily lives fuller of"
474,A SPRING REVERIE,"praises and thanksgiving-songs; clothe wearying, unlovely care, with"
475,A SPRING REVERIE,"beauty? And I wonder, too, if we are not ourselves to blame, if in the"
476,A SPRING REVERIE,pleasant walks of life we gather not enough of sunshine up to last
477,A SPRING REVERIE,"through cloudy weather? And yet, we must dream our own dreams and live"
478,A SPRING REVERIE,our own lives.
479,A SPRING REVERIE,
480,A SPRING REVERIE,"The hearts of little children drink in the spring sunshine as freely,"
481,A SPRING REVERIE,"even, as the birds and flowers. And are not their voices sweeter than"
482,A SPRING REVERIE,the song of birds and their lives dearer than all the blossoms?
483,A SPRING REVERIE,
484,A SPRING REVERIE,"A maiden sits and dreams, and in her fancy she weaves the golden meshes"
485,A SPRING REVERIE,"of a nest that will one day be her own, and if her morning and evening"
486,A SPRING REVERIE,"carol shall be sweeter than the bird’s it is not strange, for is not her"
487,A SPRING REVERIE,nest dearer and her love deeper?
488,A SPRING REVERIE,
489,A SPRING REVERIE,"In the spring sunshine a mother muses, and her thoughts have flown"
490,A SPRING REVERIE,"backward. She sits ’mid blasted buds and voiceless birds, in a"
491,A SPRING REVERIE,springtime of long ago; and though her whole pathway is strewn with
492,A SPRING REVERIE,"flowers, it is not so much to her as to know that on those little"
493,A SPRING REVERIE,"graves the violets are come again. She tends them with a loving care,"
494,A SPRING REVERIE,for they speak precious promises unto her soul.
495,A SPRING REVERIE,
496,A SPRING REVERIE,The aged couple number over and over again the many springtimes their
497,A SPRING REVERIE,lives have known in light and shadow. They drink not in the full
498,A SPRING REVERIE,"sunshine of these delicious days, for their nest and nestlings are all"
499,A SPRING REVERIE,"gone, and they are waiting for a more glorious springtime yet to"
500,A SPRING REVERIE,come--waiting for eternal sunshine and perpetual blossoms.
501,A SPRING REVERIE,
502,A SPRING REVERIE,"Upon the faces of men of great crime, through all the scars of sin, may"
503,A SPRING REVERIE,"be found traces of happy days of innocence and pleasure. Doubtless, as"
504,A SPRING REVERIE,"the springtime sun streams faintly into the cell of many a criminal,"
505,A SPRING REVERIE,"memory is quickened to life by its soft rays, and flowers of tenderness"
506,A SPRING REVERIE,"which have long slumbered bloom again, in the garden of his heart."
507,A SPRING REVERIE,"Perhaps he may remember days all sunshine, days of loving--when a dear"
508,A SPRING REVERIE,face and the light of glad eyes transfigured everything into a world of
509,A SPRING REVERIE,"glory. But temptation, like sorrow, overtakes us when we are least"
510,A SPRING REVERIE,"prepared, and on the stream of life we either drift with its current, or"
511,A SPRING REVERIE,"with strength of will and determined purpose, pull our fragile bark"
512,A SPRING REVERIE,against it.
513,A SPRING REVERIE,
514,A SPRING REVERIE,None need so much human sympathy and divine love and favor as the poor
515,A SPRING REVERIE,in spirit. The poor in purse may vie in happiness with the rich; but to
516,A SPRING REVERIE,"a life from which the light of hope has all gone out, the journey to the"
517,A SPRING REVERIE,"end is drear and desolate. Thus, it is we dream our own dreams and live"
518,A SPRING REVERIE,"our own lives, however much we may live for others."
519,A SPRING REVERIE,
520,A SPRING REVERIE,For myself--
521,A SPRING REVERIE,
522,A SPRING REVERIE,"To feel that the springtime is coming,"
523,A SPRING REVERIE,That the wildwood is all full of song;
524,A SPRING REVERIE,"That the leaves, and the grasses and blossoms,"
525,A SPRING REVERIE,"In beauty are creeping along,"
526,A SPRING REVERIE,
527,A SPRING REVERIE,Thrills my soul with a deep song of gladness;
528,A SPRING REVERIE,"And the depths of my being are stirred,"
529,A SPRING REVERIE,Till I feel that the Master is tuning
530,A SPRING REVERIE,My voice to the voice of the bird.
531,A SPRING REVERIE,
532,A SPRING REVERIE,"And what harmony thrills all creation,"
533,A SPRING REVERIE,From the brooklet’s musical flow
534,A SPRING REVERIE,"To the wonderful tide of the ocean,"
535,A SPRING REVERIE,With its ceaseless murmur of woe.
536,A SPRING REVERIE,
537,A SPRING REVERIE,"Yet, He who made earth, sky and all things,"
538,A SPRING REVERIE,"Reckons man of Himself, a part--"
539,A SPRING REVERIE,"And what to nature is budding and bloom,"
540,A SPRING REVERIE,Symbols love in the human heart.
541,A SPRING REVERIE,
542,A SPRING REVERIE,"And I look at the world as I see it,"
543,A SPRING REVERIE,"With its mingled sorrow and strife,"
544,A SPRING REVERIE,"And my lips cry out the thought of my heart,"
545,A SPRING REVERIE,What a wonderful thing is life!
546,A SPRING REVERIE,
547,A SPRING REVERIE,With eyes to behold the glory of God
548,A SPRING REVERIE,"In the stars or the blossoms of Spring,"
549,A SPRING REVERIE,"And hearts _feel_ a love, that lips may not tell,"
550,A SPRING REVERIE,"Of a glorified Presence, within."

592,TO HER DOLLY,
593,TO HER DOLLY,It may be her own little daughter
594,TO HER DOLLY,"Will fold you to her breast,"
595,TO HER DOLLY,"And softly whisper, “I love you, dear,"
596,TO HER DOLLY,I love you the very best.”
597,TO HER DOLLY,
598,TO HER DOLLY,’Twere pleasant to dream of Dolly
599,TO HER DOLLY,"As you lie in the dark up there,"

650,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Thy kingdom is the human heart;
651,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"And just so long as sympathy can soothe,"
652,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Or words of hope encourage struggling souls,"
653,ANNIVERSARY ODE,So long thy kingdom will abide with men.
654,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"And as the clouds shed dewdrops on the flowers,"
655,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Or violets breathe their fragrance on the air,"
656,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"E’en so thy poems, on our common lives,"
657,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Shed sweet refreshment, and we love thy name."
658,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Surely “There is no death!” Such souls as thine
659,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Make all life seem immortal. The sunshine,"
660,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"From thy verse, dispels the clouds of doubt"
661,ANNIVERSARY ODE,With an effulgent glory. Hid with God
662,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Is all the future; yet enough is shown
663,ANNIVERSARY ODE,To stimulate our trust for all the rest.
664,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"And, as the raindrop, tracing back its source,"
665,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Finds it in mist of brook or ocean’s spray,"
666,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"So, from the depth of the Eternal Love,"
667,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Springs individual being. Passing time
668,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Is but as links in the unending chain,"
669,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Which binds the whole together. Overhead,"
670,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Some stars shine brighter than the rest, yet each"
671,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Adds glory to the whole; beneath our feet
672,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"The spring flowers bloom again, the breath of some"
673,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Comes laden with a fragrance, which delights,"
674,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Some void of beauty, or of sweet perfume,"
675,ANNIVERSARY ODE,Yet in God’s fields no mean weed blooms in vain.
676,ANNIVERSARY ODE,
677,ANNIVERSARY ODE,From filthiest pool as pure a drop of rain
678,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"May be distilled, as from the crystal river,"
679,ANNIVERSARY ODE,And must we not believe that darkened lives
680,ANNIVERSARY ODE,"Will, somehow, in God’s time, be glorified?"

1173,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,Woulds’t know why I care for you?
1174,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,You were plucked for me by a friendly hand
1175,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,From the hillside where you grew.
1176,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,
1177,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,How could you come up from the brown earth
1178,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,And be such a gorgeous thing?
1179,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,"Did mother nature color your gown,"
1180,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,When she tinted the blue bird’s wing?
1181,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,

1190,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,And the song-birds love to nest.
1191,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,
1192,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,"To drop your seed, in the soft brown earth"
1193,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,"With your kindred little flower,"

1200,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,"Is my dearest wish, alway.”"
1201,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,

1204,TO A BLUE-FRINGED GENTIAN,"You came, a messenger of love,"

1232,A FRAGMENT,"Methinks I could lie down content,"
1233,A FRAGMENT,E’en as thy bride.
1234,A FRAGMENT,

1250,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,
1251,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"A happy Christmas? Nay, far more shall be"
1252,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,My wish for you. I know how happiness
1253,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"Flits in and out of our poor human lives,"
1254,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,Even as humming birds flit in and out
1255,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"The upturned lily’s cup, or April’s sunshine"
1256,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,Pierces through the clouds only to vanish.
1257,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"I own her magic touch, for she has been"
1258,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"My guest, and she wrought many a miracle."
1259,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,I mind how she transformed the common things
1260,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"Of life, and how she flung a glory o’er"
1261,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"The future, till my dreams of paradise"
1262,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,Seemed all fulfilled.
1263,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,
1264,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,After the storm of battle
1265,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"Cometh peace. Since I have heard her voice,"
1266,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,And felt the touch of her soft wings upon
1267,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"My troubled spirit, I have ceased to pray"
1268,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"For happiness’ return, but I await"
1269,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,Her coming--grateful if she rarely come
1270,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,And briefly stay.
1271,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,
1272,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,And so my wish for you
1273,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"Shall be my high’st prayer, that peace, God’s peace,"
1274,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"May enter through the portals of your life,"
1275,MY CHRISTMAS WISH,"And there abide, your guest, forevermore."

1284,TO A ROSEBUD,"When thou wert fresh and fair,"
1285,TO A ROSEBUD,And I recall thou did’st exhale
1286,TO A ROSEBUD,For us a fragrance rare.
1287,TO A ROSEBUD,
1288,TO A ROSEBUD,"With reverent touch, to-night I fold"
1289,TO A ROSEBUD,Thy withered leaves with care
1290,TO A ROSEBUD,"About this lifeless heart of thine,"
1291,TO A ROSEBUD,And breathe a grateful prayer.
1292,TO A ROSEBUD,
1293,TO A ROSEBUD,"O tell me, Rosebud, wert thou deaf"
1294,TO A ROSEBUD,To all we said that night;
1295,TO A ROSEBUD,Or did’st thou feel those kisses warm
1296,TO A ROSEBUD,That thrilled us with delight?
1297,TO A ROSEBUD,
1298,TO A ROSEBUD,Thy lingering breath is sweet to me
1299,TO A ROSEBUD,"Thy beauty is not fled,"

1309,TREES,How helpful to my life are forest trees!
1310,TREES,"Their beauty charms me, while their strength sustains"
1311,TREES,"My weakness, and to be a day with them"
1312,TREES,Is as a sweet communion-day with God.
1313,TREES,"How, like a strong man, stands the sturdy oak,"
1314,TREES,Mightier than all his fellows; yet he seems
1315,TREES,"To boast, not strength inherited, so much"
1316,TREES,"As from fierce battling with the elements,"
1317,TREES,"Relying not on Providence alone,"
1318,TREES,"But on himself--remembering the past,"
1319,TREES,And how from feebleness he grew to strength.
1320,TREES,Was ever king in purple and in gold
1321,TREES,So grand as they in autumn’s coloring?
1322,TREES,A most inspiring lesson to my life
1323,TREES,"Their beauty teacher. In it, I behold"
1324,TREES,A type of what this human life should be
1325,TREES,When the end cometh.
1326,TREES,
1327,TREES,"Faces, I have seen,"
1328,TREES,"That speak to me, e’en as these autumn leaves,"
1329,TREES,Of a rich harvest safely garnered in.
1330,TREES,"Would autumn leaves be just as richly dyed,"
1331,TREES,Did only sunshine and warm summer showers
1332,TREES,"Fall on them, and the dreary days come not?"
1333,TREES,"But e’en as glory of the king may fade,"
1334,TREES,"Or he be robbed of all his rich attire,"
1335,TREES,"So fade and pass away their glories all,"
1336,TREES,While ever and anon the drear winds sigh
1337,TREES,"A requiem of sadness. Yet, above"
1338,TREES,"The dead leaves rustling, do the days go on,"
1339,TREES,And spring-time gladness will return again.
1340,TREES,"O, in their hours of calm, do trees not dream"
1341,TREES,Of the bright days to come of bud and bloom?
1342,TREES,"Thus do they speak to me, and seem to teach"
1343,TREES,The wondrous mystery of life and death.
1344,TREES,The first spring dandelion’s bloom is more
1345,TREES,To me than all the written word; it speaks
1346,TREES,"Directly to the soul, and seem to be"
1347,TREES,"The voice of God. It is a thing of life,"
1348,TREES,And what can better solve the mystery?
1349,TREES,"It is a proof of promises fulfilled,"
1350,TREES,"And bids us trust, unfalteringly, when"
1351,TREES,"Again the dead leaves rustle ’neath our feet,"
1352,TREES,And the cold snow-flakes cover all we love.
1353,TREES,
1354,TREES,"O God, so many paths lead unto Thee,"
