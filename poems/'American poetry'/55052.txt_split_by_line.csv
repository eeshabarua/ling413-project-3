72,THE DE VINNE PRESS,And footsteps faltered while you trod
73,THE DE VINNE PRESS,The sloping upland bright with sod.
74,THE DE VINNE PRESS,It blossomed in your quiet life
75,THE DE VINNE PRESS,With gowans from the Neuk of Fife;
76,THE DE VINNE PRESS,And while you walked the waving wheat
77,THE DE VINNE PRESS,You dreamed of heather and the peat.
78,THE DE VINNE PRESS,You’ve gane awa! My spirit yearns
79,THE DE VINNE PRESS,To hear you read the songs of Burns;
80,THE DE VINNE PRESS,The melody I’ve faintly caught
81,THE DE VINNE PRESS,Is just the lesson that you taught.
82,THE DE VINNE PRESS,If any hear your gentle voice
83,THE DE VINNE PRESS,"In verse of mine, then I’ll rejoice"
84,THE DE VINNE PRESS,"And sing along my stumbling way,"

375,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"The beauties of Thy work,"
376,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,I catch faint glimpses of the shadows fleeing
377,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Through valleys in the murk;
378,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Yet I can feel my way--my mem’ry guides me;
379,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,I bear the yoke and smile.
380,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"I’m used to life, and nothing wounds or chides me;"

384,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Of Nature in the Spring--
385,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"The uplift of Thy hills, the song-birds trilling,"
386,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,The lyric joy they bring.
387,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,I’m not too old to see the regal beauty
388,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Of moon and stars and sun;
389,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Nature can still reveal to me my duty
390,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Till my long task is done.
391,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,
392,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"O Lord, to me the pageant is entrancing--"
393,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,The march of States and Kings!
394,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,I keenly watch the human race advancing
395,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And see Man master Things:
396,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,From him who read the secret of the thunder
397,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"And made the lightning kind,"
398,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Down to this marvel--all the growing wonder
399,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Of force controlled by Mind.
400,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,
401,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"And this dear land of ours, the freeman’s Nation!"
402,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"Lord, let me live and see"
403,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"Fulfilment of our fathers’ aspiration,"
404,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,When each man’s really free!
405,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"When all the strength and skill that move the mountains,"
406,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"And pile up riches great,"
407,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Shall sweeten patriotism at its fountains
408,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And purify the State!
409,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,
410,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,But there are closer ties than these that bind me
411,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And make me long to stay
412,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And linger in the dusk where Death may find me
413,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,On Thine own chosen day;
414,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,There’s one who walks beside me in the gloaming
415,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And holds my faltering hand--
416,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Without her guidance I can make no homing
417,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,In any distant land.
418,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,
419,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"Some day when we are tired, like children playing,"
420,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,And wearied drop our toys--
421,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,When all the work and burden of our staying
422,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Has mingled with our joys--
423,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"With those we love around--our eyelids drooping,"
424,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,Too spent with toil to weep--
425,A PRAYER OF OLD AGE,"Like some kind nurse o’er drowsy children stooping,"

435,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,From out the sky. The light of heaven shines
436,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Upon its wrinkled brow, that seems a part"
437,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Of that stupendous dome of boundless blue
438,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Where, like a pebble in the ocean depths,"
439,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,This little world is lost. The sparkling sun
440,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Plays gently in the deep green, icy clefts"
441,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Like moonlight in the tender eyes of one
442,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Who looks to heaven to find her lover’s face.
443,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Silent, serene, implacable it stands--"
444,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,A mighty symbol of the Force that moved
445,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Across the surface of the youthful earth
446,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"And scored the continents with valleys deep,"
447,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,As children write upon the yielding sand.
448,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Back to the dawn of things its lineage runs--
449,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Countless ages back to that bleak time
450,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,When frightful monsters played upon the hills--
451,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Always the same, yet moving slowly onward,"
452,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"In heaven its head, its feet upon the world."
453,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,The Rhone that trickles from the glacier’s edge--
454,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Makes valleys smile with grain and flower and fruit
455,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,And turns the wheels that forge the tools of trade--
456,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Is but the lash with which the giant plays
457,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,And spins the tops that swarm with struggling men.
458,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"“What is Man, that Thou art mindful of him?”--"
459,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"This pleasure or this pain, this wealth or want,"
460,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,This tragic comedy we call our life!
461,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,

463,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"A shepherd drives his sheep, and fondly bears"
464,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Above the rocky stream the weakling lamb;
465,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,The children hear the father’s kindly voice
466,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"And run to greet and cheer his late return,"
467,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,While from his humble cottage gleams a light.
468,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,
469,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,The sheep are nestled in their sheltering fold--
470,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"The door springs open to a welcome cry,"
471,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,And all at last are safe within the Home.
472,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,
473,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,In cold and awful majesty it stands
474,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,"Against the darkening sky,--Force without warmth,"
475,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Strength without passion.
476,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,But at the touch
477,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,Of homely human ways its terrors flee
478,THE RHONE GLACIER--SUNSET,And Force is swallowed up in Life with Love.
