100,WOOING SONG,
101,WOOING SONG,Love is the blossom where there blows
102,WOOING SONG,Every thing that lives or grows:
103,WOOING SONG,"Love doth make the Heavens to move,"
104,WOOING SONG,And the Sun doth burn in love:
105,WOOING SONG,"Love the strong and weak doth yoke,"
106,WOOING SONG,"And makes the ivy climb the oak,"
107,WOOING SONG,"Under whose shadows lions wild,"
108,WOOING SONG,"Softened by love, grow tame and mild:"
109,WOOING SONG,"Love no medicine can appease,"
110,WOOING SONG,He burns fishes in the seas:
111,WOOING SONG,"Not all the skill his wounds can stench,"
112,WOOING SONG,Not all the sea his fire can quench.
113,WOOING SONG,Love did make the bloody spear
114,WOOING SONG,"Once a leavy coat to wear,"
115,WOOING SONG,While in his leaves there shrouded lay
116,WOOING SONG,"Sweet birds, for love that sing and play"
117,WOOING SONG,And of all love's joyful flame
118,WOOING SONG,I the bud and blossom am.
119,WOOING SONG,"Only bend thy knee to me,"
120,WOOING SONG,Thy wooing shall thy winning be!
121,WOOING SONG,
122,WOOING SONG,"See, see the flowers that below"
123,WOOING SONG,Now as fresh as morning blow;
124,WOOING SONG,And of all the virgin rose
125,WOOING SONG,That as bright Aurora shows;
126,WOOING SONG,"How they all unleaved die,"
127,WOOING SONG,Losing their virginity!
128,WOOING SONG,"Like unto a summer shade,"
129,WOOING SONG,"But now born, and now they fade."
130,WOOING SONG,Every thing doth pass away;
131,WOOING SONG,There is danger in delay:
132,WOOING SONG,"Come, come, gather then the rose,"
133,WOOING SONG,"Gather it, or it you lose!"
134,WOOING SONG,All the sand of Tagus' shore
135,WOOING SONG,Into my bosom casts his ore:
136,WOOING SONG,All the valleys' swimming corn
137,WOOING SONG,To my house is yearly borne:
138,WOOING SONG,Every grape of every vine
139,WOOING SONG,Is gladly bruised to make me wine:
140,WOOING SONG,"While ten thousand kings, as proud,"
141,WOOING SONG,"To carry up my train have bowed,"
142,WOOING SONG,And a world of ladies send me
143,WOOING SONG,In my chambers to attend me:
144,WOOING SONG,"All the stars in Heaven that shine,"
145,WOOING SONG,"And ten thousand more, are mine:"
146,WOOING SONG,"Only bend thy knee to me,"
147,WOOING SONG,Thy wooing shall thy winning be.

178,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,For your offence.
179,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,I'll shut mine eyes to keep you in;
180,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,I'll make you fast it for your sin;
181,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,I'll count your power not worth a pin.
182,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,- Alas! what hereby shall I win
183,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,If he gainsay me?
184,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,
185,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,What if I beat the wanton boy
186,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,With many a rod?
187,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,"He will repay me with annoy,"
188,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,Because a god.
189,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,Then sit thou safely on my knee;
190,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,Then let thy bower my bosom be;
191,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,"Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee;"
192,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,"O Cupid, so thou pity me,"
193,ROSALIND'S MADRIGAL,"Spare not, but play thee!"

251,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
252,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Beauties, have ye seen this toy,"
253,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Called Love, a little boy,"
254,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Almost naked, wanton, blind;"
255,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Cruel now, and then as kind?"
256,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"If he be amongst ye, say?"
257,VENUS' RUNAWAY,He is Venus' runaway.
258,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
259,VENUS' RUNAWAY,She that will but now discover
260,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Where the winged wag doth hover,"
261,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Shall to-night receive a kiss,"
262,VENUS' RUNAWAY,How or where herself would wish:
263,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"But who brings him to his mother,"
264,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Shall have that kiss, and another."
265,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
266,VENUS' RUNAWAY,He hath marks about him plenty:
267,VENUS' RUNAWAY,You shall know him among twenty.
268,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"All his body is a fire,"
269,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"And his breath a flame entire,"
270,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"That, being shot like lightning in,"
271,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Wounds the heart, but not the skin."
272,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
273,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"At his sight, the sun hath turned,"
274,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Neptune in the waters burned;
275,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Hell hath felt a greater heat;
276,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Jove himself forsook his seat:
277,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"From the centre to the sky,"
278,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Are his trophies reared high.
279,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
280,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Wings he hath, which though ye clip,"
281,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"He will leap from lip to lip,"
282,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Over liver, lights, and heart,"
283,VENUS' RUNAWAY,But not stay in any part;
284,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"But if chance his arrow misses,"
285,VENUS' RUNAWAY,He will shoot himself in kisses.
286,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
287,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"He doth bear a golden bow,"
288,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"And a quiver, hanging low,"
289,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Full of arrows, that outbrave"
290,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Dian's shafts; where, if he have"
291,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Any head more sharp than other,"
292,VENUS' RUNAWAY,With that first he strikes his mother.
293,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
294,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Still the fairest are his fuel.
295,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"When his days are to be cruel,"
296,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Lovers' hearts are all his food,"
297,VENUS' RUNAWAY,And his baths their warmest blood:
298,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Naught but wounds his hands doth season,"
299,VENUS' RUNAWAY,And he hates none like to Reason.
300,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
301,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Trust him not; his words, though sweet,"
302,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Seldom with his heart do meet.
303,VENUS' RUNAWAY,All his practice is deceit;
304,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Every gift it is a bait;
305,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Not a kiss but poison bears;
306,VENUS' RUNAWAY,And most treason in his tears.
307,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
308,VENUS' RUNAWAY,Idle minutes are his reign;
309,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Then, the straggler makes his gain"
310,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"By presenting maids with toys,"
311,VENUS' RUNAWAY,And would have ye think them joys:
312,VENUS' RUNAWAY,'Tis the ambition of the elf
313,VENUS' RUNAWAY,To have all childish as himself.
314,VENUS' RUNAWAY,
315,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"If by these ye please to know him,"
316,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Beauties, be not nice, but show him."
317,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Though ye had a will to hide him,"
318,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Now, we hope, ye'll not abide him;"
319,VENUS' RUNAWAY,"Since you hear his falser play,"
320,VENUS' RUNAWAY,And that he's Venus' runaway.

3536,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,"

3549,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon.

3551,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon.
3552,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Deals she an unkindness, 'tis but her rapid measure,"
3553,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Even as in a dance; and her smile can heal no less:

3555,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Off a sunny border, she was made to bruise and bless."
3556,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3557,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping

3565,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3566,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Stepping down the hill with her fair companions,"
3567,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Arm in arm, all against the raying West,"

3571,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Whispered the world was; morning light is she.

3584,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Sunrays, leaning on our southern hills and lighting"
3585,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Wild cloud-mountains that drag the hills along,"
3586,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter
3587,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Chill as a dull face frowning on a song.
3588,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Ay, but shows the South-west a ripple-feathered bosom"
3589,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
3590,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Scaling the mid-heavens as they stream, there comes a sunset"

3592,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3593,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the window"
3594,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Turns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams,"
3595,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Beautiful she looks, like a white water-lily"
3596,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams.
3597,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle
3598,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,"
3599,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden-lily"
3600,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Pure from the night, and splendid for the day."
3601,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3602,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Mother of the dews, dark eye-lashed twilight,"

3605,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him.
3606,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet,"
3607,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers.
3608,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Let me hear her laughter, I would have her ever"
3609,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Cool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers."
3610,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3611,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose;
3612,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Up lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands."
3613,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"My sweet leads: she knows not why, but now she loiters,"
3614,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Eyes the bent anemones, and hangs her hands."
3615,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,"
3616,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Coming the rose: and unaware a cry
3617,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Springs in her bosom for odors and for color,"
3618,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Covert and the nightingale; she knows not why.
3619,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3620,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips,"
3621,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain:
3622,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Some bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angel"
3623,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"She will be; she lifts them, and on she speeds again."
3624,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Black the driving rain cloud breasts the iron gateway:
3625,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,She is forth to cheer a neighbor lacking mirth.
3626,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder
3627,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Saw I once a white dove, sole light of earth."
3628,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3629,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden,"
3630,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Trained to stand in rows, and asking if they please."
3631,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones:
3632,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,O my wild ones! they tell me more than these.
3633,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"You, my wild one, you tell of honied field-rose,"
3634,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Violet, blushing eglantine in life; and even as they,"
3635,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness,"
3636,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"You are of life's, on the banks that line the way."
3637,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3638,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose,"
3639,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three.
3640,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Parted is the window; she sleeps; the starry jasmine
3641,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me.
3642,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Sweeter unpossessed, have I said of her my sweetest?"
3643,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Not while she sleeps: while she sleeps the jasmine breathes,"
3644,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Luring her to love: she sleeps; the starry jasmine
3645,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths.
3646,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3647,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades;
3648,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-gray leaf;
3649,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Yellow with stonecrop; the moss-mounds are yellow;
3650,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Blue-necked the wheat sways, yellowing to the sheaf."
3651,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Green-yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle;
3652,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine:
3653,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens,"
3654,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Thinking of the harvest: I look and think of mine.
3655,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3656,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,This I may know: her dressing and undressing
3657,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport
3658,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Shift from cloud to moonlight; or edging over thunder
3659,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Slips a ray of sun; or sweeping into port
3660,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,White sails furl; or on the ocean borders
3661,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,White sails lean along the waves leaping green.
3662,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Visions of her shower before me, but from eyesight"
3663,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Guarded she would be like the sun were she seen.
3664,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3665,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse
3666,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Open with the morn, and in a breezy link"
3667,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Freshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadowed orchard,"
3668,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink.
3669,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Busy in the grass the early sun of summer
3670,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Swarms, and the blackbird's mellow fluting notes"
3671,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Call my darling up with round and roguish challenge:
3672,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Quaintest, richest carol of all the singing throats!"
3673,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3674,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Cool was the woodside; cool as her white dairy
3675,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Keeping sweet the cream-pan; and there the boys from school,"
3676,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Cricketing below, rushed brown and red with sunshine;"
3677,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,O the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool!
3678,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Spying from the farm, herself she fetched a pitcher"
3679,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Full of milk, and tilted for each in turn the beak."
3680,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Then a little fellow, mouth up and on tiptoe,"

3684,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Through the long noon coo, crooning through the coo."
3685,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Loose droop the leaves, and down the sleepy roadway"
3686,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Sometimes pipes a chaffinch; loose droops the blue.
3687,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in the river,"
3688,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Breathless, given up to sun and gnat and fly."

3691,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3692,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"O the golden sheaf, the rustling treasure-armful!"
3693,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!
3694,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,O the treasure-tresses one another over
3695,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Nodding!  O the girdle slack about the waist!
3696,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
3697,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Quick amid the wheat-ears: wound about the waist,"
3698,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Gathered, see these brides of Earth one blush of ripeness!"
3699,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced.

3704,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow.
3705,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree
3706,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Gazes in this whiteness: nightlong could I.
3707,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Here may life on death or death on life be painted.
3708,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die!
3709,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3710,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Gossips count her faults; they scour a narrow chamber
3711,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Where there is no window, read not heaven or her."
3712,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"""When she was a tiny,"" one aged woman quavers,"
3713,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear.
3714,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Faults she had once as she learned to run and tumbled:
3715,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Faults of feature some see, beauty not complete."
3716,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Yet, good gossips, beauty that makes holy"
3717,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Earth and air, may have faults from head to feet."

3720,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Deepens her brown eyebrows, while in new surprise"
3721,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,High rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger;
3722,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Yet am I the light and living of her eyes.
3723,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming,"
3724,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Nets her in her blushes, and wounds her, and tames. -"
3725,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Sure of her haven, O like a dove alighting,"
3726,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Arms up, she dropped: our souls were in our names."
3727,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3728,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise.
3729,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Yellow oats and brown wheat, barley pale as rye,"
3730,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher,"
3731,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Felt the girdle loosened, seen the tresses fly."
3732,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset.
3733,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Swift with the to-morrow, green-winged Spring!"
3734,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Sing from the South-west, bring her back the truants,"
3735,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Nightingale and swallow, song and dipping wing."
3736,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3737,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Soft new beech-leaves, up to beamy April"
3738,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain, you,"
3739,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Lucid in the moon, raise lilies to the skyfields,"
3740,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Youngest green transfused in silver shining through:
3741,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Fairer than the lily, than the wild white cherry:"
3742,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Fair as in image my seraph love appears
3743,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids:
3744,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears.
3745,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,
3746,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,"
3747,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need.
3748,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,"
3749,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,"Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed."
3750,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October;
3751,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Streaming like the flag-reed South-west blown;
3752,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam:
3753,LOVE IN THE VALLEY,All seem to know what is for heaven alone.

3791,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3792,PRAISE OF MY LADY,My lady seems of ivory
3793,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Forehead, straight nose, and cheeks that be"
3794,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Hollowed a little mournfully.
3795,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3796,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3797,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Her forehead, overshadowed much"
3798,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"By bows of hair, has a wave such"
3799,PRAISE OF MY LADY,As God was good to make for me.
3800,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3801,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3802,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Not greatly long my lady's hair,"
3803,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Nor yet with yellow color fair,"
3804,PRAISE OF MY LADY,But thick and crisped wonderfully:
3805,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3806,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3807,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Heavy to make the pale face sad,"
3808,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"And dark, but dead as though it had"
3809,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Been forged by God most wonderfully
3810,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3811,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3812,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Of some strange metal, thread by thread,"
3813,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"To stand out from my lady's head,"
3814,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Not moving much to tangle me.
3815,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3816,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3817,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Beneath her brows the lids fall slow,"
3818,PRAISE OF MY LADY,The lashes a clear shadow throw
3819,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Where I would wish my lips to be.
3820,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3821,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3822,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Her great eyes, standing far apart,"
3823,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Draw up some memory from her heart,"
3824,PRAISE OF MY LADY,And gaze out very mournfully;
3825,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3826,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3827,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"So beautiful and kind they are,"
3828,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"But most times looking out afar,"
3829,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Waiting for something, not for me."
3830,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3831,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3832,PRAISE OF MY LADY,I wonder if the lashes long
3833,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Are those that do her bright eyes wrong,"
3834,PRAISE OF MY LADY,For always half tears seem to be
3835,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3836,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3837,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Lurking below the underlid,"
3838,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Darkening the place where they lie hid:
3839,PRAISE OF MY LADY,If they should rise and flow for me!
3840,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3841,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3842,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Her full lips being made to kiss,"
3843,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Curled up and pensive each one is;
3844,PRAISE OF MY LADY,This makes me faint to stand and see.
3845,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3846,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3847,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Her lips are not contented now,"
3848,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Because the hours pass so slow
3849,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Towards a sweet time: (pray for me),"
3850,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3851,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3852,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Nay, hold thy peace! for who can tell?"
3853,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"But this at least I know full well,"
3854,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Her lips are parted longingly,"
3855,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3856,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3857,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"So passionate and swift to move,"
3858,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"To pluck at any flying love,"
3859,PRAISE OF MY LADY,That I grow faint to stand and see.
3860,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3861,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3862,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Yea! there beneath them is her chin,"
3863,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"So fine and round, it were a sin"
3864,PRAISE OF MY LADY,To feel no weaker when I see
3865,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3866,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3867,PRAISE OF MY LADY,God's dealings; for with so much care
3868,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"And troublous, faint lines wrought in there,"
3869,PRAISE OF MY LADY,He finishes her face for me.
3870,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3871,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3872,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Of her long neck what shall I say?
3873,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"What things about her body's sway,"
3874,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Like a knight's pennon or slim tree
3875,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3876,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3877,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Set gently waving in the wind;
3878,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Or her long hands that I may find
3879,PRAISE OF MY LADY,On some day sweet to move o'er me?
3880,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3881,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3882,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"God pity me though, if I missed"
3883,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"The telling, how along her wrist"
3884,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"The veins creep, dying languidly"
3885,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3886,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3887,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Inside her tender palm and thin.
3888,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"Now give me pardon, dear, wherein"
3889,PRAISE OF MY LADY,My voice is weak and vexes thee.
3890,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3891,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3892,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"All men that see her any time,"
3893,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"I charge you straightly in this rhyme,"
3894,PRAISE OF MY LADY,"What, and wherever you may be,"
3895,PRAISE OF MY LADY,Beata mea Domina!
3896,PRAISE OF MY LADY,
3897,PRAISE OF MY LADY,To kneel before her; as for me
3898,PRAISE OF MY LADY,I choke and grow quite faint to see
3899,PRAISE OF MY LADY,My lady moving graciously.

3910,MADONNA MIA,Between two bowers;
3911,MADONNA MIA,In either of the twain
3912,MADONNA MIA,Red roses full of rain;
3913,MADONNA MIA,She hath for bondwomen
3914,MADONNA MIA,All kind of flowers.
3915,MADONNA MIA,
3916,MADONNA MIA,She hath no handmaid fair
3917,MADONNA MIA,To draw her curled gold hair
3918,MADONNA MIA,Through rings of gold that bear
3919,MADONNA MIA,Her whole hair's weight;
3920,MADONNA MIA,She hath no maids to stand

3922,MADONNA MIA,In all that great green land
3923,MADONNA MIA,None is so great.
3924,MADONNA MIA,
3925,MADONNA MIA,She hath no more to wear

3927,MADONNA MIA,"Drawn over eyes and hair,"
3928,MADONNA MIA,"Wrought with strange gold,"
3929,MADONNA MIA,"Made for some great queen's head,"

3934,MADONNA MIA,Beneath her eyelids deep
3935,MADONNA MIA,"Love lying seems asleep,"

3938,MADONNA MIA,"Her breasts are like white birds,"
3939,MADONNA MIA,And all her gracious words
3940,MADONNA MIA,As water-grass to herds
3941,MADONNA MIA,In the June-days.
3942,MADONNA MIA,
3943,MADONNA MIA,To her all dews that fall
3944,MADONNA MIA,And rains are musical;
3945,MADONNA MIA,"Her flowers are fed from all,"
3946,MADONNA MIA,Her joys from these;
3947,MADONNA MIA,In the deep-feathered firs
3948,MADONNA MIA,"Their gift of joy is hers,"
3949,MADONNA MIA,In the least breath that stirs
3950,MADONNA MIA,Across the trees.
3951,MADONNA MIA,
3952,MADONNA MIA,"She grows with greenest leaves,"
3953,MADONNA MIA,"Ripens with reddest sheaves,"
3954,MADONNA MIA,"Forgets, remembers, grieves,"
3955,MADONNA MIA,And is not sad;

3958,MADONNA MIA,"None knows her, weak or wise,"
3959,MADONNA MIA,Or tired or glad.
3960,MADONNA MIA,
3961,MADONNA MIA,"None knows, none understands,"

3963,MADONNA MIA,Though you should search all lands
3964,MADONNA MIA,"Wherein time grows,"
3965,MADONNA MIA,"What snows are like her feet,"

7298,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7299,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers,"
7300,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Full of sweet trees and color of glad grass,"
7301,A BALLAD OF LIFE,In midst whereof there was
7302,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours,"
7303,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon"
7304,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Made my blood burn and swoon
7305,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Like a flame rained upon.
7306,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids' blue,"
7307,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And her mouth's sad red heavy rose all through
7308,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Seemed sad with glad things gone.
7309,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7310,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"She held a little cithern by the strings,"
7311,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Shaped heartwise, strung with subtle-colored hair"
7312,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Of some dead lute player
7313,A BALLAD OF LIFE,That in dead years had done delicious things.
7314,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The seven strings were named accordingly;
7315,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The first string charity,"
7316,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The second tenderness,"
7317,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The rest were pleasure, sorrow, sleep, and sin,"
7318,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And loving kindness, that is pity's kin"
7319,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And is most pitiless.
7320,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7321,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"There were three men with her, each garmented"
7322,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"With gold, and shod with gold upon the feet;"
7323,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And with plucked ears of wheat.
7324,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The first man's hair was wound upon his head:
7325,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"His face was red, and his mouth curled and sad;"
7326,A BALLAD OF LIFE,All his gold garment had
7327,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Pale stains of dust and rust.
7328,A BALLAD OF LIFE,A riven hood was pulled across his eyes;
7329,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The token of him being upon this wise
7330,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Made for a sign of Lust.
7331,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7332,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The next 'was Shame, with hollow heavy face"
7333,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Colored like green wood when flame kindles it.
7334,A BALLAD OF LIFE,He hath such feeble feet
7335,A BALLAD OF LIFE,They may not well endure in any place.
7336,A BALLAD OF LIFE,His face was full of gray old miseries.
7337,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And all his blood's increase
7338,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Was even increase of pain.
7339,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The last was Fear, that is akin to Death;"
7340,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"He is Shame's friend, and always as Shame saith"
7341,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Fear answers him again.
7342,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7343,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"My soul said in me: This is marvelous,"
7344,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Seeing the air's face is not so delicate
7345,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Nor the sun's grace so great,"
7346,A BALLAD OF LIFE,If sin and she be kin or amorous.
7347,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And seeing where maidens served her on their knees,"
7348,A BALLAD OF LIFE,I bade one crave of these
7349,A BALLAD OF LIFE,To know the cause thereof.
7350,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Then Fear said: I am Pity that was dead.
7351,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And Shame said: I am Sorrow comforted.
7352,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And Lust said: I am Love.
7353,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7354,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Thereat her hands began a lute-playing
7355,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And her sweet mouth a song in a strange tongue;
7356,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And all the while she sung
7357,A BALLAD OF LIFE,There was no sound but long tears following
7358,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Long tears upon men's faces, waxen white"
7359,A BALLAD OF LIFE,With extreme sad delight.
7360,A BALLAD OF LIFE,But those three following men
7361,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Became as men raised up among the dead;
7362,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Great glad mouths open, and fair cheeks made red"
7363,A BALLAD OF LIFE,With child's blood come again.
7364,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7365,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Then I said: Now assuredly I see
7366,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"My lady is perfect, and transfigureth"
7367,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"All sin and sorrow and death,"
7368,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Making them fair as her own eyelids be,"
7369,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Or lips wherein my whole soul's life abides;
7370,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Or as her sweet white sides
7371,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And bosom carved to kiss.
7372,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Now therefore, if her pity further me,"
7373,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Doubtless for her sake all my days shall be
7374,A BALLAD OF LIFE,As righteous as she is.
7375,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
7376,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Forth, ballad, and take roses in both arms,"
7377,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Even till the top rose touch thee in the throat
7378,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Where the least thornprick harms;
7379,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And girdled in thy golden singing-coat,"
7380,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Come thou before my lady and say this:
7381,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Borgia, thy gold hair's color burns in me,"
7382,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Thy mouth makes beat my blood in feverish rhymes;
7383,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Therefore so many as these roses be,"
7384,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Kiss me so many times.
7385,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Then it may be, seeing how sweet she is,"
7386,A BALLAD OF LIFE,That she will stoop herself none otherwise
7387,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Than a blown vine-branch doth,"
7388,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And kiss thee with soft laughter on thine eyes,"
7389,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Ballad, and on thy mouth."

12559,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,The parson for him staid:
12560,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Yet by his leave (for all his haste),"
12561,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"He did not so much wish all past,"
12562,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,(Perchance) as did the maid.
12563,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12564,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)
12565,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,For such a maid no Whitsun-ale
12566,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Could ever yet produce:
12567,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"No grape that's kindly ripe, could be"
12568,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"So round, so plump, so soft, as she,"
12569,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Nor half so full of juice.
12570,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12571,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Her finger was so small, the ring"
12572,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Would not stay on which they did bring;
12573,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,It was too wide a peck:
12574,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,And to say truth (for out it must)
12575,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,It looked like the great collar (just)
12576,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,About our young colt's neck.
12577,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12578,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Her feet beneath her petticoat
12579,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Like little mice stole in and out,"
12580,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,As if they feared the light:
12581,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"But oh, she dances such a way!"
12582,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,No sun upon an Easter-day
12583,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Is half so fine a sight.
12584,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12585,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Her cheeks so rare a white was on,"
12586,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,No daisy makes comparison;
12587,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Who sees them is undone;
12588,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"For streaks of red were mingled there,"
12589,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Such as are on a Cath'rine pear,"
12590,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,The side that's next the sun.
12591,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12592,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Her lips were red; and one was thin
12593,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Compared to that was next her chin
12594,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,(Some bee had stung it newly);
12595,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"But, Dick, her eyes so guard her face,"
12596,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"I durst no more upon them gaze,"
12597,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Than on the sun in July.
12598,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12599,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Her mouth so small, when she does speak,"
12600,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Thou'dst swear her teeth her words did break,"
12601,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,That they might passage get;
12602,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"But she so handled still the matter,"
12603,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"They came as good as ours, or better,"
12604,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,And are not spent a whit.
12605,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12606,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Passion o' me! how I run on!
12607,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"There's that that would be thought upon,"
12608,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"I trow, besides the bride:"
12609,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"The business of the kitchen's great,"
12610,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,For it is fit that men should eat;
12611,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Nor was it there denied.
12612,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12613,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Just in the nick the cook knocked thrice,"
12614,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,And all the waiters in a trice
12615,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,His summons did obey;
12616,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Each serving-man, with dish in hand,"
12617,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Marched boldly up, like our trained-band,"
12618,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Presented and away.
12619,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12620,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"When all the meat was on the table,"
12621,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"What man of knife, or teeth, was able"
12622,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,To stay to be intreated?
12623,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"And this the very reason was,"
12624,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Before the parson could say grace,"
12625,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,The company was seated.
12626,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12627,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Now hats fly off, and youths carouse;"
12628,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Healths first go round, and then the house,"
12629,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,The bride's come thick and thick;
12630,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"And when 'twas named another's health,"
12631,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Perhaps he made it hers by stealth,"
12632,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"(And who could help it, Dick?)"
12633,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12634,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,O' th' sudden up they rise and dance;
12635,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Then sit again, and sigh, and glance;"
12636,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Then dance again, and kiss."
12637,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Thus sev'ral ways the time did pass,"
12638,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"Till ev'ry woman wished her place,"
12639,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,And ev'ry man wished his.
12640,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,
12641,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,By this time all were stol'n aside
12642,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,To counsel and undress the bride;
12643,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,But that he must not know:
12644,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,"But yet 'twas thought he guessed her mind,"
12645,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,And did not mean to stay behind
12646,A BALLAD UPON A WEDDING,Above an hour or so.

12852,THE COUNTRY WEDDING,"May I venture to ask you, fair maiden, which way?"

12861,THE COUNTRY WEDDING,Of such a companion if you would approve.
12862,THE COUNTRY WEDDING,"Your offer, kind shepherd, is civil, I own;"

13631,LOVE AND AGE,"I played with you 'mid cowslips blowing,"
13632,LOVE AND AGE,When I was six and you were four;
13633,LOVE AND AGE,"When garlands weaving, flower-balls throwing,"
13634,LOVE AND AGE,Were pleasures soon to please no more.
13635,LOVE AND AGE,"Through groves and meads, o'er grass and heather,"
13636,LOVE AND AGE,"With little playmates, to and fro,"
13637,LOVE AND AGE,We wandered hand in hand together;
13638,LOVE AND AGE,But that was sixty years ago.
13639,LOVE AND AGE,
13640,LOVE AND AGE,"You grew a lovely roseate maiden,"
13641,LOVE AND AGE,And still our early love was strong;
13642,LOVE AND AGE,"Still with no care our days were laden,"
13643,LOVE AND AGE,They glided joyously along;
13644,LOVE AND AGE,And I did love you very dearly -
13645,LOVE AND AGE,"How dearly, words want power to show;"
13646,LOVE AND AGE,I thought your heart was touched as nearly;
13647,LOVE AND AGE,But that was fifty years ago.
13648,LOVE AND AGE,
13649,LOVE AND AGE,"Then other lovers came around you,"
13650,LOVE AND AGE,"Your beauty grew from year to year,"

13652,LOVE AND AGE,The center of its glittering sphere.
13653,LOVE AND AGE,"I saw you then, first vows forsaking,"
13654,LOVE AND AGE,"On rank and wealth, your hand bestow;"

13656,LOVE AND AGE,But that was forty years ago.
13657,LOVE AND AGE,
13658,LOVE AND AGE,"And I lived on, to wed another:"
13659,LOVE AND AGE,No cause she gave me to repine;
13660,LOVE AND AGE,"And when I heard you were a mother,"
13661,LOVE AND AGE,I did not wish the children mine.
13662,LOVE AND AGE,"My own young flock, in fair progression,"
13663,LOVE AND AGE,Made up a pleasant Christmas row:
13664,LOVE AND AGE,My joy in them was past expression; -

13666,LOVE AND AGE,
13667,LOVE AND AGE,"You grew a matron plump and comely,"
13668,LOVE AND AGE,You dwelt in fashion's brightest blaze;
13669,LOVE AND AGE,My earthly lot was far more homely;
13670,LOVE AND AGE,But I too had my festal days.
13671,LOVE AND AGE,No merrier eyes have ever glistened
13672,LOVE AND AGE,"Around the hearth-stone's wintry glow,"
13673,LOVE AND AGE,Than when my youngest child was christened: -

13675,LOVE AND AGE,
13676,LOVE AND AGE,"Time passed.  My eldest girl was married,"

13679,LOVE AND AGE,Among the wild-flowered meads to play.
13680,LOVE AND AGE,"In our old fields of childish pleasure,"
13681,LOVE AND AGE,"Where now, as then, the cowslips blow,"
13682,LOVE AND AGE,"She fills her basket's ample measure, -"
13683,LOVE AND AGE,And that is not ten years ago.
13684,LOVE AND AGE,
13685,LOVE AND AGE,But though first love's impassioned blindness
13686,LOVE AND AGE,"Has passed away in colder light,"
13687,LOVE AND AGE,"I still have thought of you with kindness,"
13688,LOVE AND AGE,"And shall do, till our last good-night."

15819,ANDREA DEL SARTO,But you can hear at least when people speak:
15820,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And that cartoon, the second from the door"
15821,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"- It is the thing, Love! so such thing should be -"
15822,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Behold Madonna! - I am bold to say.
15823,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I can do with my pencil what I know,"
15824,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"What I see, what at bottom of my heart"
15825,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I wish for, if I ever wish so deep -"
15826,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Do easily, too - when I say, perfectly,"
15827,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,"
15828,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Who listened to the Legate's talk last week,"
15829,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And just as much they used to say in France.
15830,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!"
15831,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"No sketches first, no studies, that's long past;"
15832,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I do what many dream of all their lives,"
15833,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"- Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,"
15834,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And fail in doing.  I could count twenty such
15835,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"On twice your fingers, and not leave this town,"
15836,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Who strive - you don't know how the others strive
15837,ANDREA DEL SARTO,To paint a little thing like that you smeared
15838,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Carelessly passing with your robes afloat, -"
15839,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says,"
15840,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"(I know his name, no matter) - so much less!"
15841,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged."
15842,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"There burns a truer light of God in them,"
15843,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,"
15844,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt"
15845,ANDREA DEL SARTO,This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine.
15846,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,"
15847,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me,"
15848,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Enter and take their place there sure enough,"
15849,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Though they come back and cannot tell the world.
15850,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here."
15851,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The sudden blood of these men! at a word -
15852,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too."
15853,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I, painting from myself and to myself,"
15854,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame"
15855,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Or their praise either.  Somebody remarks
15856,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Morello's outline there is wrongly traced,"
15857,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,"
15858,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?
15859,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?"
15860,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,"
15861,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Or what's a heaven for?  All is silver-gray;
15862,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Placid and perfect with my art; the worse!
15863,ANDREA DEL SARTO,I know both what I want and what might gain;
15864,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And yet how profitless to know, to sigh"
15865,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"""Had I been two, another and myself,"
15866,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Our head would have o'erlooked the world!"" No doubt."
15867,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth"
15868,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The Urbinate who died five years ago.
15869,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)"
15870,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well, I can fancy how he did it all,"
15871,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,"
15872,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,"
15873,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Above and through his art - for it gives way;
15874,ANDREA DEL SARTO,That arm is wrongly put - and there again -
15875,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,"
15876,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,"
15877,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"He means right, - that, a child may understand."
15878,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:"
15879,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"But all the play, the insight and the stretch -"
15880,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Out of me, out of me!  And wherefore out?"
15881,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,"
15882,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"We might have risen to Rafael, I and you!"
15883,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think -"
15884,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"More than I merit, yes, by many times."
15885,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"But had you - oh, with the same perfect brow,"
15886,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,"
15887,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird"
15888,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare -"
15889,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!"
15890,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Some women do so.  Had the mouth there urged,"
15891,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"""God and the glory! never care for gain."
15892,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The present by the future, what is that?"
15893,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!"
15894,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"""
15895,ANDREA DEL SARTO,I might have done it for you.  So it seems:
15896,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Perhaps not.  All is as God overrules.
15897,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;"
15898,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The rest avail not.  Why do I need you?
15899,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?"
15900,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"In this world, who can do a thing, will not;"
15901,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:"
15902,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Yet the will's somewhat - somewhat, too, the power -"
15903,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And thus we half-men struggle.  At the end,"
15904,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"God I conclude, compensates, punishes."
15905,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,"
15906,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"That I am something underrated here,"
15907,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth."
15908,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,"
15909,ANDREA DEL SARTO,For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.
15910,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The best is when they pass and look aside;
15911,ANDREA DEL SARTO,But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.
15912,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well may they speak!  That Francis, that first time,"
15913,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!
15914,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,"
15915,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear,"
15916,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"In that humane great monarch's golden look, -"
15917,ANDREA DEL SARTO,One finger in his beard or twisted curl
15918,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile,"
15919,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,"
15920,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,"
15921,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I painting proudly with his breath on me,"
15922,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,"
15923,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls"
15924,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts, -"
15925,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,"
15926,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"This in the background, waiting on my work;"
15927,ANDREA DEL SARTO,To crown the issue with a last reward!
15928,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"A good time, was it not, my kingly days?"
15929,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And had you not grown restless . . . but I know -
15930,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said;"
15931,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Too live the life grew, golden and not gray,"
15932,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt
15933,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.
15934,ANDREA DEL SARTO,How could it end in any other way?
15935,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"You called me, and I came home to your heart."
15936,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The triumph was, - to reach and stay there; since"
15937,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?"
15938,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,"
15939,ANDREA DEL SARTO,You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!
15940,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"""Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;"
15941,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The Roman's is the better when you pray,"
15942,ANDREA DEL SARTO,But still the other's Virgin was his wife -
15943,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Men will excuse me.  I am glad to judge
15944,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows
15945,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"My better fortune, I resolve to think."
15946,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"For do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,"
15947,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Said one day Agnolo, his very self"
15948,ANDREA DEL SARTO,To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . .
15949,ANDREA DEL SARTO,(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts
15950,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,"
15951,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Too lifted up in heart because of it)
15952,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub"
15953,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,"
15954,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Who, were he set to plan and execute"
15955,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,"
15956,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"""
15957,ANDREA DEL SARTO,To Rafael's!  And indeed the arm is wrong.
15958,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see,"
15959,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Give the chalk here - quick, thus the line should go!"
15960,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out!"
15961,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,"
15962,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?"
15963,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Do you forget already words like those?)
15964,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"If really there was such a chance, so lost, -"
15965,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Is, whether you're - not grateful - but more pleased."
15966,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well, let me think so.  And you smile indeed!"
15967,ANDREA DEL SARTO,This hour has been an hour!  Another smile?
15968,ANDREA DEL SARTO,If you would sit thus by me every night
15969,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I should work better, do you comprehend?"
15970,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I mean that I should earn more, give you more."
15971,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;"
15972,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,"
15973,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.
15974,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Come from the window, love, - come in, at last,"
15975,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Inside the melancholy little house
15976,ANDREA DEL SARTO,We built to be so gay with.  God is just.
15977,ANDREA DEL SARTO,King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights
15978,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,"
15979,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The walls become illumined, brick from brick"
15980,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,"
15981,ANDREA DEL SARTO,That gold of his I did cement them with!
15982,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Let us but love each other.  Must you go?
15983,ANDREA DEL SARTO,That Cousin here again? he waits outside?
15984,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Must see you - you, and not with me?  Those loans?"
15985,ANDREA DEL SARTO,More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that?
15986,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend?"
15987,ANDREA DEL SARTO,While hand and eye and something of a heart
15988,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth?"
15989,ANDREA DEL SARTO,I'll pay my fancy.  Only let me sit
15990,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"The gray remainder of the evening out,"
15991,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly"
15992,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"How I could paint, were I but back in France,"
15993,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"One picture, just one more, - the Virgin's face,"
15994,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Not yours this time!  I want you at my side
15995,ANDREA DEL SARTO,To hear them - that is Michel Agnolo -
15996,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.
15997,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Will you?  To-morrow, satisfy your friend."
15998,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I take the subjects for his corridor,"
15999,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Finish the portrait out of hand - there, there,"
16000,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And throw him in another thing or two
16001,ANDREA DEL SARTO,If he demurs; the whole should prove enough
16002,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"To pay for this same Cousin's freak.  Beside,"
16003,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"What's better and what's all I care about,"
16004,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!
16005,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Love, does that please you?  Ah, but what does he,"
16006,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The Cousin! what does he to please you more?
16007,ANDREA DEL SARTO,
16008,ANDREA DEL SARTO,I am grown peaceful as old age to-night.
16009,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I regret little, I would change still less."
16010,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Since there my past life lies, why alter it?"
16011,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The very wrong to Francis! - it is true
16012,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"I took his coin, was tempted and complied,"
16013,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"And built this house and sinned, and all is said."
16014,ANDREA DEL SARTO,My father and my mother died of want.
16015,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Well, had I riches of my own? you see"
16016,ANDREA DEL SARTO,How one gets rich!  Let each one bear his lot.
16017,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:"
16018,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And I have labored somewhat in my time
16019,ANDREA DEL SARTO,And not been paid profusely.  Some good son
16020,ANDREA DEL SARTO,Paint my two hundred pictures - let him try!
16021,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"No doubt, there's something strikes a balance.  Yes,"
16022,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"You loved me quite enough, it seems to-night."
16023,ANDREA DEL SARTO,This must suffice me here.  What would one have?
16024,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance -"
16025,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Four great walls in the New Jerusalem,"
16026,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Meted on each side by the angel's reed,"
16027,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo, and me"
16028,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"To cover, - the three first without a wife,"
16029,ANDREA DEL SARTO,While I have mine!  So - still they overcome
16030,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Because there's still Lucrezia, - as I choose."
16031,ANDREA DEL SARTO,
16032,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"Again the Cousin's whistle!  Go, my love."

16043,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Worked busily a day, and there she stands."

16047,MY LAST DUCHESS,"The depth and passion of its earnest glance,"

16050,MY LAST DUCHESS,"And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,"
16051,MY LAST DUCHESS,"How such a glance came there; so, not the first"

16053,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Her husband's presence only, called that spot"
16054,MY LAST DUCHESS,Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps
16055,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Fra Pandolf chanced to say, ""Her mantle laps"
16056,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Over my lady's wrist too much,"" or ""Paint"
16057,MY LAST DUCHESS,Must never hope to reproduce the faint
16058,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Half-flush that dies along her throat"": such stuff"
16059,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough"
16060,MY LAST DUCHESS,For calling up that spot of joy.  She had
16061,MY LAST DUCHESS,"A heart - how shall I say? - too soon made glad,"
16062,MY LAST DUCHESS,Too easily impressed: she liked whate'er

16067,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule"
16068,MY LAST DUCHESS,She rode with round the terrace - all and each
16069,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Would draw from her alike the approving speech,"
16070,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Or blush, at least. She thanked men, - good! but thanked"
16071,MY LAST DUCHESS,Somehow - I know not how - as if she ranked
16072,MY LAST DUCHESS,My gift of a nine hundred-years-old name
16073,MY LAST DUCHESS,With anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blame
16074,MY LAST DUCHESS,This sort of trifling?  Even had you skill

16080,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,"
16081,MY LAST DUCHESS,- E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose
16082,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,"
16083,MY LAST DUCHESS,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
16084,MY LAST DUCHESS,Much the same smile?  This grew; I gave commands;
16085,MY LAST DUCHESS,Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands
16086,MY LAST DUCHESS,As if alive.  Will't please you rise?  We'll meet

16706,THE BETROTHED,"Will it see me safe through my journey, or leave me bogged in the mire?"

17340,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER
17341,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17342,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"I said - Then, dearest, since 'tis so,"
17343,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Since now at length my fate I know,"
17344,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Since nothing all my love avails,"
17345,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Since all, my life seemed meant for, fails,"
17346,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Since this was written and needs must be -
17347,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,My whole heart rises up to bless
17348,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Your name in pride and thankfulness!
17349,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Take back the hope you gave, - I claim"
17350,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Only a memory of the same,"
17351,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"- And this beside, if you will not blame;"
17352,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Your leave for one more last ride with me.
17353,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17354,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,My mistress bent that brow of hers;
17355,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
17356,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"When pity would be softening through,"
17357,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Fixed me a breathing-while or two
17358,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,With life or death in the balance: right!
17359,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,The blood replenished me again;
17360,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,My last thought was at least not vain:
17361,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"I and my mistress, side by side"
17362,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Shall be together, breathe and ride,"
17363,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"So, one day more am I deified."
17364,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Who knows but the world may end to-night?
17365,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17366,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Hush! if you saw some western cloud
17367,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed"
17368,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,By many benedictions - sun's
17369,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,And moon's and evening-star's at once -
17370,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"And so, you, looking and loving best,"
17371,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Conscious grew, your passion drew"
17372,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,"
17373,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Down on you, near and yet more near,"
17374,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Till flesh must fade for heaven was here! -
17375,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Thus leant she and lingered-joy and fear!
17376,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Thus lay she a moment on my breast.
17377,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17378,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Then we began to ride.  My soul
17379,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll"
17380,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
17381,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Past hopes already lay behind.
17382,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What need to strive with a life awry?
17383,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Had I said that, had I done this,"
17384,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"So might I gain, so might I miss."
17385,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Might she have loved me? just as well
17386,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"She might have hated, who can tell!"
17387,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Where had I been now if the worst befell?
17388,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"And here we are riding, she and I."
17389,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17390,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Fail I alone, in words and deeds?"
17391,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Why, all men strive, and who succeeds?"
17392,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,"
17393,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Saw other regions, cities new,"
17394,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,As the world rushed by on either side.
17395,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"I thought, - All labor, yet no less"
17396,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
17397,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Look at the end of work, contrast"
17398,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"The petty done, the undone vast,"
17399,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
17400,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,I hoped she would love me; here we ride.
17401,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17402,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What hand and brain went ever paired?
17403,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What heart alike conceived and dared?
17404,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What act proved all its thought had been?
17405,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What will but felt the fleshly screen?
17406,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,We ride and I see her bosom heave.
17407,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,There's many a crown for who can reach.
17408,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!"
17409,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"The flag stuck on a heap of bones,"
17410,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,A soldier's doing! what atones?
17411,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
17412,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"My riding is better, by their leave."
17413,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17414,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"What does it all mean, poet? Well,"
17415,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell"
17416,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,What we felt only; you expressed
17417,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"You hold things beautiful the best,"
17418,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"And place them in rhyme so, side by side."
17419,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,"
17420,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Have you yourself what's best for men?
17421,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Are you - poor, sick, old ere your time -"
17422,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Nearer one whit your own sublime
17423,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Than we who never have turned a rhyme?
17424,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Sing, riding's a joy!  For me, I ride."
17425,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17426,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"And you, great sculptor - so, you gave"
17427,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"A score of years to Art, her slave,"
17428,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"And that's your Venus, whence we turn"
17429,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,To yonder girl that fords the burn!
17430,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"You acquiesce, and shall I repine?"
17431,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"What, man of music, you grown gray"
17432,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"With notes and nothing else to say,"
17433,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Is this your sole praise from a friend,"
17434,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"""Greatly his opera's strains intend,"
17435,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"But in music we know how fashions end!"""
17436,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"I gave my youth: but we ride, in fine."
17437,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17438,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Who knows what's fit for us?  Had fate
17439,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Proposed bliss here should sublimate
17440,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,My being - had I signed the bond -
17441,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Still one must lead some life beyond,"
17442,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried."
17443,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"This foot once planted on the goal,"
17444,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"This glory-garland round my soul,"
17445,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,Could I descry such?  Try and test!
17446,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,I sink back shuddering from the quest.
17447,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?"
17448,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride."
17449,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,
17450,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,And yet - she has not spoke so long!
17451,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"What if heaven be that, fair and strong"
17452,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"At life's best, with our eyes upturned"
17453,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Whither life's flower is first discerned,"
17454,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"We, fixed so, ever should so abide?"
17455,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"What if we still ride on, we two,"
17456,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"With life forever old yet new,"
17457,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"Changed not in kind but in degree,"
17458,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,"The instant made eternity, -"
17459,THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER,And heaven just prove that I and she

17914,AUX ITALIENS,
17915,AUX ITALIENS,"It smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet,"

17940,AUX ITALIENS,"My thinking of her, or the music's strain,"

18542,MAUD MULLER,Maud Muller on a summer's day
18543,MAUD MULLER,Raked the meadow sweet with hay.
18544,MAUD MULLER,
18545,MAUD MULLER,Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
18546,MAUD MULLER,Of simple beauty and rustic health.
18547,MAUD MULLER,
18548,MAUD MULLER,"Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee"
18549,MAUD MULLER,The mock-bird echoed from his tree.
18550,MAUD MULLER,
18551,MAUD MULLER,"But when she glanced to the far-off town,"
18552,MAUD MULLER,"White from its hill-slope looking down,"
18553,MAUD MULLER,
18554,MAUD MULLER,"The sweet song died, and a vague unrest"
18555,MAUD MULLER,"And a nameless longing filled her breast, -"
18556,MAUD MULLER,
18557,MAUD MULLER,"A wish that she hardly dared to own,"
18558,MAUD MULLER,For something better than she had known.
18559,MAUD MULLER,
18560,MAUD MULLER,"The Judge rode slowly down the lane,"
18561,MAUD MULLER,Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane.
18562,MAUD MULLER,
18563,MAUD MULLER,He drew his bridle in the shade
18564,MAUD MULLER,"Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,"
18565,MAUD MULLER,
18566,MAUD MULLER,And asked a draught from the spring that flowed
18567,MAUD MULLER,Through the meadow across the road.
18568,MAUD MULLER,
18569,MAUD MULLER,"She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,"
18570,MAUD MULLER,"And filled for him her small tin cup,"
18571,MAUD MULLER,
18572,MAUD MULLER,"And blushed as she gave it, looking down"
18573,MAUD MULLER,"On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown."
18574,MAUD MULLER,
18575,MAUD MULLER,"""Thanks!"" said the Judge; ""a sweeter draught"
18576,MAUD MULLER,"From a fairer hand was never quaffed."""
18577,MAUD MULLER,
18578,MAUD MULLER,"He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,"
18579,MAUD MULLER,Of the singing birds and the humming bees;
18580,MAUD MULLER,
18581,MAUD MULLER,"Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether"
18582,MAUD MULLER,The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.
18583,MAUD MULLER,
18584,MAUD MULLER,"And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown,"
18585,MAUD MULLER,And her graceful ankles bare and brown;
18586,MAUD MULLER,
18587,MAUD MULLER,"And listened, while a pleased surprise"
18588,MAUD MULLER,Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.
18589,MAUD MULLER,
18590,MAUD MULLER,"At last, like one who for delay"
18591,MAUD MULLER,"Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away."
18592,MAUD MULLER,
18593,MAUD MULLER,"Maud Muller looked and sighed: ""Ah me!"
18594,MAUD MULLER,That I the Judge's bride might be!
18595,MAUD MULLER,
18596,MAUD MULLER,"""He would dress me up in silks so fine,"
18597,MAUD MULLER,And praise and toast me at his wine.
18598,MAUD MULLER,
18599,MAUD MULLER,"""My father should wear a broadcloth coat;"
18600,MAUD MULLER,My brother should sail a painted boat.

18605,MAUD MULLER,"""And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor,"
18606,MAUD MULLER,"And all should bless me who left our door."""
18607,MAUD MULLER,
18608,MAUD MULLER,"The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,"
18609,MAUD MULLER,And saw Maud Muller standing still.
18610,MAUD MULLER,
18611,MAUD MULLER,"""A form more fair, a face more sweet,"
18612,MAUD MULLER,Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.
18613,MAUD MULLER,
18614,MAUD MULLER,"""And her modest answer and graceful air"
18615,MAUD MULLER,Show her wise and good as she is fair.
18616,MAUD MULLER,
18617,MAUD MULLER,"""Would she were mine, and I to-day,"
18618,MAUD MULLER,"Like her, a harvester of hay;"
18619,MAUD MULLER,
18620,MAUD MULLER,"""No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,"
18621,MAUD MULLER,"Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,"
18622,MAUD MULLER,
18623,MAUD MULLER,"""But low of cattle and song of birds,"
18624,MAUD MULLER,"And health and quiet and loving words."""
18625,MAUD MULLER,
18626,MAUD MULLER,"But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,"
18627,MAUD MULLER,"And his mother, vain of her rank and gold."
18628,MAUD MULLER,
18629,MAUD MULLER,"So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,"
18630,MAUD MULLER,And Maud was left in the field alone.
18631,MAUD MULLER,
18632,MAUD MULLER,"But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,"
18633,MAUD MULLER,When he hummed in court an old love-tune;
18634,MAUD MULLER,
18635,MAUD MULLER,And the young girl mused beside the well
18636,MAUD MULLER,Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.
18637,MAUD MULLER,
18638,MAUD MULLER,"He wedded a wife of richest dower,"
18639,MAUD MULLER,"Who lived for fashion, as he for power."
18640,MAUD MULLER,
18641,MAUD MULLER,"Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow,"
18642,MAUD MULLER,He watched a picture come and go;
18643,MAUD MULLER,
18644,MAUD MULLER,And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes
18645,MAUD MULLER,Looked out in their innocent surprise.
18646,MAUD MULLER,
18647,MAUD MULLER,"Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,"
18648,MAUD MULLER,He longed for the wayside well instead;
18649,MAUD MULLER,
18650,MAUD MULLER,And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
18651,MAUD MULLER,To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.
18652,MAUD MULLER,
18653,MAUD MULLER,"And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,"
18654,MAUD MULLER,"""Ah, that I were free again!"
18655,MAUD MULLER,
18656,MAUD MULLER,"""Free as when I rode that day,"
18657,MAUD MULLER,"Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay."""
18658,MAUD MULLER,
18659,MAUD MULLER,"She wedded a man unlearned and poor,"
18660,MAUD MULLER,And many children played round her door.
18661,MAUD MULLER,
18662,MAUD MULLER,"But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain,"
18663,MAUD MULLER,Left their traces on heart and brain.
18664,MAUD MULLER,
18665,MAUD MULLER,"And oft, when the summer sun shone hot"
18666,MAUD MULLER,"On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,"
18667,MAUD MULLER,
18668,MAUD MULLER,And she heard the little spring brook fall
18669,MAUD MULLER,"Over the roadside, through the wall,"
18670,MAUD MULLER,
18671,MAUD MULLER,In the shade of the apple-tree again
18672,MAUD MULLER,She saw a rider draw his rein;
18673,MAUD MULLER,
18674,MAUD MULLER,"And, gazing down with timid grace,"
18675,MAUD MULLER,She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
18676,MAUD MULLER,
18677,MAUD MULLER,Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
18678,MAUD MULLER,Stretched away into stately halls;
18679,MAUD MULLER,
18680,MAUD MULLER,"The weary wheel to a spinet turned,"
18681,MAUD MULLER,"The tallow candle an astral burned,"
18682,MAUD MULLER,
18683,MAUD MULLER,"And for him who sat by the chimney lug,"
18684,MAUD MULLER,"Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug,"
18685,MAUD MULLER,
18686,MAUD MULLER,"A manly form at her side she saw,"
18687,MAUD MULLER,And joy was duty and love was law.
18688,MAUD MULLER,
18689,MAUD MULLER,"Then she took up her burden of life again,"
18690,MAUD MULLER,"Saying only, ""It might have been."""

18692,MAUD MULLER,"Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,"

18694,MAUD MULLER,
18695,MAUD MULLER,"God pity them both! and pity us all,"
18696,MAUD MULLER,Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
18697,MAUD MULLER,
18698,MAUD MULLER,"For all sad words of tongue or pen,"
18699,MAUD MULLER,"The saddest are these: ""It might have been!"""
18700,MAUD MULLER,
18701,MAUD MULLER,"Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies"

18799,EURYDICE,I hear him yet with trembling breath
18800,EURYDICE,"Low calling, ""O sweet love!"

18815,EURYDICE,Some terror turned me to look back:

18817,EURYDICE,"What hast thou done!  What hast thou done!"""
18818,EURYDICE,"And then I saw no more the sun,"

21446,MY PLAYMATE,A sweeter memory blow;

22692,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"It tore the elm-tops down for spite,"
22693,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And did its worst to vex the lake:
22694,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,I listened with heart fit to break.
22695,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,When glided in Porphyria; straight
22696,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"She shut the cold out and the storm,"
22697,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
22698,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;"
22699,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Which done, she rose, and from her form"
22700,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,"
22701,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And laid her soiled gloves by, untied"
22702,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Her hat and let the damp hair fall,"
22703,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And, last, she sat down by my side"

22705,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"She put my arm about her waist,"
22706,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And made her smooth white shoulder bare,"
22707,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And all her yellow hair displaced,"
22708,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,"
22709,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,"
22710,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Murmuring how she loved me - she
22711,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Too weak, for all her heart's endeavor,"
22712,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,To set its struggling passion free
22713,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"From pride, and vainer ties dissever,"
22714,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And give herself to me for ever.
22715,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"But passion sometimes would prevail,"
22716,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain
22717,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,A sudden thought of one so pale
22718,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"For love of her, and all in vain:"
22719,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"So, she was come through wind and rain."
22720,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Be sure I looked up at her eyes
22721,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Happy and proud; at last I knew
22722,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
22723,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Made my heart swell, and still it grew"
22724,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,While I debated what to do.
22725,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"That moment she was mine, mine, fair,"
22726,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Perfectly pure and good: I found
22727,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"A thing to do, and all her hair"
22728,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,In one long yellow string I wound
22729,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Three times her little throat around,"
22730,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And strangled her.  No pain felt she;
22731,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,I am quite sure she felt no pain.
22732,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"As a shut bud that holds a bee,"
22733,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,I warily oped her lids: again
22734,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
22735,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And I untightened next the tress
22736,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,About her neck; her cheek once more
22737,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
22738,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"I propped her head up as before,"
22739,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Only, this time my shoulder bore"
22740,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"Her head, which droops upon it still:"
22741,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"The smiling rosy little head,"
22742,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"So glad it has its utmost will,"
22743,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"That all it scorned at once is fled,"
22744,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And I, its love, am gained instead!"
22745,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Porphyria's love: she guessed not how
22746,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,Her darling one wish would he heard.
22747,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And thus we sit together now,"
22748,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,"And all night long we have not stirred,"
22749,PORPHYRIA'S LOVER,And yet God has not said a word!

23274,OUTGROWN,she has simply outgrown:
23275,OUTGROWN,"One can read the whole matter, translating her heart"
23276,OUTGROWN,by the light of one's own.
23277,OUTGROWN,
23278,OUTGROWN,Can you bear me to talk with you frankly?  There is much that
23279,OUTGROWN,my heart would say;
23280,OUTGROWN,"And you know we were children together, have quarreled"
23281,OUTGROWN,"and ""made up"" in play."
23282,OUTGROWN,
23283,OUTGROWN,"And so, for the sake of old friendship, I venture to tell you"
23284,OUTGROWN,"the truth, -"

23288,OUTGROWN,"Five summers ago, when you wooed her, you stood on the"

23290,OUTGROWN,"Face to face, heart to heart, never dreaming your souls"
23291,OUTGROWN,should be parted again.
23292,OUTGROWN,
23293,OUTGROWN,"She loved you at that time entirely, in the bloom, of her life's"
23294,OUTGROWN,early May;
23295,OUTGROWN,"And it is not her fault, I repeat it, that she does not love you"

23304,OUTGROWN,The stars are not farther above you in yon luminous atmosphere!
23305,OUTGROWN,
23306,OUTGROWN,"For she whom you crowned with fresh roses, down yonder, five summers ago,"
23307,OUTGROWN,Has learned that the first of our duties to God and ourselves is to grow.
23308,OUTGROWN,
23309,OUTGROWN,Her eyes they are sweeter and calmer: but their vision is clearer as well;
23310,OUTGROWN,"Her voice has a tender cadence, but is pure as a silver bell."
23311,OUTGROWN,
23312,OUTGROWN,Her face has the look worn by those who with God and his angels have talked:
23313,OUTGROWN,The white robes she wears are less white than the spirits with whom she has walked.
23314,OUTGROWN,
23315,OUTGROWN,"And you?  Have you aimed at the highest?  Have you, too,"
23316,OUTGROWN,aspired and prayed?

23318,OUTGROWN,undismayed?
23319,OUTGROWN,
23320,OUTGROWN,"Have you, too, grown purer and wiser, as the months"
23321,OUTGROWN,and the years have rolled on?
23322,OUTGROWN,Did you meet her this morning rejoicing in the triumph
23323,OUTGROWN,of victory won?
23324,OUTGROWN,
23325,OUTGROWN,"Nay, hear me!  The truth cannot harm you.  When to-day"
23326,OUTGROWN,in her presence you stood
23327,OUTGROWN,Was the hand that you gave her as white and clean as that
23328,OUTGROWN,of her womanhood?
23329,OUTGROWN,
23330,OUTGROWN,Go measure yourself by her standard; look back on the years
23331,OUTGROWN,that have fled:
23332,OUTGROWN,"Then ask, if you need, why she tells you that the love of her"
23333,OUTGROWN,girlhood is dead.
23334,OUTGROWN,
23335,OUTGROWN,"She cannot look down to her lover: her love, like her soul, aspires;"
23336,OUTGROWN,"He must stand by her side, or above her, who would kindle its"
23337,OUTGROWN,holy fires.
23338,OUTGROWN,
23339,OUTGROWN,Now farewell!  For the sake of old friendship I have ventured
23340,OUTGROWN,"to tell you the truth,"
23341,OUTGROWN,"As plainly, perhaps, and as bluntly as I might in our earlier youth."

23661,THE PORTRAIT,Where she lay all in white.
23662,THE PORTRAIT,
23663,THE PORTRAIT,"The moon shone over her winding-sheet,"

23667,THE PORTRAIT,
23668,THE PORTRAIT,"As I stretched my hand, I held my breath;"
23669,THE PORTRAIT,I turned as I drew the curtains apart:
23670,THE PORTRAIT,I dared not look on the face of death:

23672,THE PORTRAIT,
23673,THE PORTRAIT,"I thought at first, as my touch fell there,"

23683,THE PORTRAIT,"Opposite me by the tapers' light,"
23684,THE PORTRAIT,"The friend of my bosom, the man I loved,"
23685,THE PORTRAIT,"Stood over the corpse, and all as white,"

23708,THE PORTRAIT,"We found the portrait there, in its place:"
23709,THE PORTRAIT,We opened it by the tapers' shine:
23710,THE PORTRAIT,The gems were all unchanged: the face
23711,THE PORTRAIT,Was - neither his nor mine.

24495,THE VAMPIRE,Honor and faith and a sure intent
24496,THE VAMPIRE,"(And it wasn't the least what the lady meant),"

24508,THE VAMPIRE,"Which she might have seen when she threw him aside, -"
24509,THE VAMPIRE,(But it isn't on record the lady tried)

24511,THE VAMPIRE,(Even as you and I!)
24512,THE VAMPIRE,
24513,THE VAMPIRE,And it isn't the shame and it isn't the blame
24514,THE VAMPIRE,That stings like a white-hot brand.

24531,AGATHA,Upon her cheek and changing moods.

24547,AGATHA,To touch and fondling kiss.
24548,AGATHA,
24549,AGATHA,"And still she haunts those woodland ways,"
24550,AGATHA,Though all fond fancy finds there now
24551,AGATHA,"To mind of spring or summer days,"

24553,AGATHA,"The past sits widowed on her brow,"
24554,AGATHA,"Homeward she wends with wintry gaze,"
24555,AGATHA,"To walls that house a hollow vow,"
24556,AGATHA,To hearth where love hath ceased to blaze:
24557,AGATHA,"Watches the clammy twilight wane,"
24558,AGATHA,With grief too fixed for woe or tear;
24559,AGATHA,"And, with her forehead 'gainst the pane,"
24560,AGATHA,Envies the dying year.

26969,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Loving again your love:
26970,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Is it not sweet beneath the palm?
26971,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Is not the warm day rife
26972,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,With some long mystic golden calm
26973,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Better than love and life?
26974,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,
26975,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,The broad quaint odorous leaves like hands
26976,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"Weaving the fair day through,"

26979,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,And many a strange rich breathing sound
26980,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Ravishes morn and noon:
26981,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,And in that place you must have found
26982,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Death a delicious swoon.
26983,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,
26984,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Hold me no longer for a word
26985,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,I used to say or sing:
26986,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"Ah, long ago you must have heard"
26987,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,So many a sweeter thing:
26988,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,For rich earth must have reached your heart
26989,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,And turned the faith to flowers;
26990,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"And warm wind stolen, part by part,"
26991,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Your soul through faithless hours.
26992,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,
26993,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,And many a soft seed must have won
26994,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"Soil of some yielding thought,"
26995,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,To bring a bloom up to the sun
26996,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,That else had ne'er been brought;
26997,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"And, doubtless, many a passionate hue"
26998,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,"Hath made that place more fair,"
26999,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Making some passionate part of you
27000,SARRAZINE'S SONG TO HER DEAD LOVER,Faithless to me down there.

27007,LOVE AND DEATH,"In the wild autumn weather, when the rain was on the sea,"
27008,LOVE AND DEATH,"And the boughs sobbed together, Death came and spake to me:"
27009,LOVE AND DEATH,"""Those red drops of thy heart I have come to take from thee;"
27010,LOVE AND DEATH,"As the storm sheds the rose, so thy love shall broken be,"""
27011,LOVE AND DEATH,Said Death to me.
27012,LOVE AND DEATH,
27013,LOVE AND DEATH,"Then I stood straight and fearless while the rain was in the wave,"
27014,LOVE AND DEATH,"And I spake low and tearless: ""When thou hast made my grave,"
27015,LOVE AND DEATH,Those red drops from my heart then thou shalt surely have;
27016,LOVE AND DEATH,"But the rose keeps its bloom, as I my love will save"

27022,LOVE AND DEATH,Now the summer air is sweet with the rose's fragrant breath
27023,LOVE AND DEATH,That conquered Death.

27065,ANNABEL LEE,"It was many and many a year ago,"
27066,ANNABEL LEE,"In a kingdom by the sea,"
27067,ANNABEL LEE,That a maiden there lived whom you may know
27068,ANNABEL LEE,By the name of Annabel Lee;
27069,ANNABEL LEE,And this maiden she lived with no other thought
27070,ANNABEL LEE,Than to love and be loved by me.
27071,ANNABEL LEE,
27072,ANNABEL LEE,"I was a child and she was a child,"
27073,ANNABEL LEE,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
27074,ANNABEL LEE,"But we loved with a love that was more than love,"
27075,ANNABEL LEE,I and my Annabel Lee;
27076,ANNABEL LEE,With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
27077,ANNABEL LEE,Coveted her and me.
27078,ANNABEL LEE,
27079,ANNABEL LEE,"And this was the reason that, long ago,"
27080,ANNABEL LEE,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
27081,ANNABEL LEE,"A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling"
27082,ANNABEL LEE,My beautiful Annabel Lee;
27083,ANNABEL LEE,So that her highborn kinsmen came
27084,ANNABEL LEE,"And bore her away from me,"
27085,ANNABEL LEE,To shut her up in a sepulcher
27086,ANNABEL LEE,In this kingdom by the sea.
27087,ANNABEL LEE,
27088,ANNABEL LEE,"The angels, not half so happy in heaven,"
27089,ANNABEL LEE,Went envying her and me;
27090,ANNABEL LEE,"Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,"
27091,ANNABEL LEE,In this kingdom by the sea)
27092,ANNABEL LEE,"That the wind came out of the cloud by night,"
27093,ANNABEL LEE,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
27094,ANNABEL LEE,
27095,ANNABEL LEE,But our love it was stronger by far than the love
27096,ANNABEL LEE,"Of those who were older than we,"
27097,ANNABEL LEE,Of many far wiser than we;
27098,ANNABEL LEE,"And neither the angels in heaven above,"
27099,ANNABEL LEE,"Nor the demons down under the sea,"
27100,ANNABEL LEE,Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
27101,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:
27102,ANNABEL LEE,
27103,ANNABEL LEE,"For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams"
27104,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
27105,ANNABEL LEE,"And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes"
27106,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
27107,ANNABEL LEE,"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side"
27108,ANNABEL LEE,"Of my darling - my darling - my life and my bride,"
27109,ANNABEL LEE,"In the sepulcher there by the sea,"

27120,FOR ANNIE,Is over at last -

27123,FOR ANNIE,
27124,FOR ANNIE,"Sadly, I know"
27125,FOR ANNIE,"I am shorn of my strength,"
27126,FOR ANNIE,And no muscle I move
27127,FOR ANNIE,As I lie at full length:
27128,FOR ANNIE,But no matter - I feel
27129,FOR ANNIE,I am better at length.
27130,FOR ANNIE,
27131,FOR ANNIE,And I rest so composedly
27132,FOR ANNIE,"Now, in my bed,"
27133,FOR ANNIE,That any beholder
27134,FOR ANNIE,Might fancy me dead -
27135,FOR ANNIE,"Might start at beholding me,"

27137,FOR ANNIE,

27142,FOR ANNIE,"At heart - ah, that horrible,"
27143,FOR ANNIE,Horrible throbbing!
27144,FOR ANNIE,
27145,FOR ANNIE,The sickness - the nausea -
27146,FOR ANNIE,The pitiless pain -
27147,FOR ANNIE,"Have ceased, with the fever"
27148,FOR ANNIE,That maddened my brain -
27149,FOR ANNIE,"With the fever called ""Living"""
27150,FOR ANNIE,That burned in my brain.
27151,FOR ANNIE,
27152,FOR ANNIE,And O! of all tortures
27153,FOR ANNIE,That torture the worst
27154,FOR ANNIE,Has abated - the terrible
27155,FOR ANNIE,Torture of thirst
27156,FOR ANNIE,For the naphthaline river
27157,FOR ANNIE,Of Passion accurst -
27158,FOR ANNIE,I have drunk of a water
27159,FOR ANNIE,"That quenches all thirst,"
27160,FOR ANNIE,
27161,FOR ANNIE,"- Of a water that flows,"
27162,FOR ANNIE,"With a lullaby sound,"
27163,FOR ANNIE,From a spring but a very few
27164,FOR ANNIE,Feet under ground -
27165,FOR ANNIE,From a cavern not very far
27166,FOR ANNIE,Down under ground.
27167,FOR ANNIE,
27168,FOR ANNIE,And ah! let it never
27169,FOR ANNIE,Be foolishly said
27170,FOR ANNIE,"That my room it is gloomy,"
27171,FOR ANNIE,And narrow my bed;
27172,FOR ANNIE,For man never slept
27173,FOR ANNIE,In a different bed -
27174,FOR ANNIE,"And, to sleep, you must slumber"
27175,FOR ANNIE,In just such a bed.
27176,FOR ANNIE,
27177,FOR ANNIE,My tantalized spirit
27178,FOR ANNIE,"Here blandly reposes,"
27179,FOR ANNIE,"Forgetting, or never"
27180,FOR ANNIE,"Regretting, its roses -"
27181,FOR ANNIE,Its old agitations
27182,FOR ANNIE,Of myrtles and roses:
27183,FOR ANNIE,
27184,FOR ANNIE,"For now, while so quietly"
27185,FOR ANNIE,"Lying, it fancies"
27186,FOR ANNIE,A holier odor
27187,FOR ANNIE,"About it, of pansies -"
27188,FOR ANNIE,"A rosemary odor,"
27189,FOR ANNIE,Commingled with pansies -
27190,FOR ANNIE,With rue and the beautiful
27191,FOR ANNIE,Puritan pansies.
27192,FOR ANNIE,
27193,FOR ANNIE,"And so it lies happily,"
27194,FOR ANNIE,Bathing in many
27195,FOR ANNIE,A dream of the truth
27196,FOR ANNIE,And the beauty of Annie -
27197,FOR ANNIE,Drowned in a bath
27198,FOR ANNIE,Of the tresses of Annie.
27199,FOR ANNIE,
27200,FOR ANNIE,"She tenderly kissed me,"
27201,FOR ANNIE,"She fondly caressed,"
27202,FOR ANNIE,And then I fell gently
27203,FOR ANNIE,To sleep on her breast -
27204,FOR ANNIE,Deeply to sleep
27205,FOR ANNIE,From the heaven of her breast.
27206,FOR ANNIE,
27207,FOR ANNIE,"When the light was extinguished,"
27208,FOR ANNIE,"She covered me warm,"
27209,FOR ANNIE,And she prayed to the angels
27210,FOR ANNIE,To keep me from harm -
27211,FOR ANNIE,To the queen of the angels
27212,FOR ANNIE,To shield me from harm.
27213,FOR ANNIE,
27214,FOR ANNIE,"And I lie so composedly,"
27215,FOR ANNIE,"Now, in my bed"
27216,FOR ANNIE,"(Knowing her love),"
27217,FOR ANNIE,That you fancy me dead -
27218,FOR ANNIE,"And I rest so contentedly,"
27219,FOR ANNIE,"Now, in my bed"
27220,FOR ANNIE,"(With her love at my breast),"
27221,FOR ANNIE,That you fancy me dead -
27222,FOR ANNIE,"That you shudder to look at me,"
27223,FOR ANNIE,Thinking me dead.
27224,FOR ANNIE,
27225,FOR ANNIE,But my heart it is brighter
27226,FOR ANNIE,Than all of the many
27227,FOR ANNIE,"Stars in the sky,"
27228,FOR ANNIE,For it sparkles with Annie -
27229,FOR ANNIE,It glows with the light
27230,FOR ANNIE,Of the love of my Annie -
27231,FOR ANNIE,"With the thought, of the light"

27259,TELLING THE BEES,There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;

27269,TELLING THE BEES,"Since we parted, a month had passed, -"

27272,TELLING THE BEES,On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.
27273,TELLING THE BEES,
27274,TELLING THE BEES,"I can see it all now, - the slantwise rain"
27275,TELLING THE BEES,"Of light through the leaves,"
27276,TELLING THE BEES,"The sundown's blaze on her window-pane,"
27277,TELLING THE BEES,The bloom of her roses under the eaves.

27282,TELLING THE BEES,Nothing changed but the hives of bees.
27283,TELLING THE BEES,
27284,TELLING THE BEES,"Before them, under the garden wall,"
27285,TELLING THE BEES,"Forward and back,"
27286,TELLING THE BEES,"Went drearily singing the chore-girl small,"
27287,TELLING THE BEES,Draping each hive with a shred of black.
27288,TELLING THE BEES,
27289,TELLING THE BEES,"Trembling, I listened: the summer sun"
27290,TELLING THE BEES,Had the chill of snow;

27302,TELLING THE BEES,Sung to the bees stealing out and in.
27303,TELLING THE BEES,
27304,TELLING THE BEES,And the song she was singing ever since

27893,HELIOTROPE,"But when he spoke of varied lore,"
27894,HELIOTROPE,"Paroxytones and modes potential,"
27895,HELIOTROPE,She listened with a face that wore
27896,HELIOTROPE,"A look half fond, half reverential."
27897,HELIOTROPE,"To her, that earnest voice was sweet,"
27898,HELIOTROPE,"And, though her love had no confessor,"
27899,HELIOTROPE,Her girlish heart lay at the feet
27900,HELIOTROPE,Of that particular professor.

27902,HELIOTROPE,"And he had learned, among his books"

27904,HELIOTROPE,"To watch those ever-changing looks,"
27905,HELIOTROPE,"The wistful eyes, the tresses golden,"

27909,HELIOTROPE,Crowned with its coronet of fire.
27910,HELIOTROPE,
27911,HELIOTROPE,"Her sunny smile, her winsome ways,"
27912,HELIOTROPE,"Were more to him than all his knowledge,"
27913,HELIOTROPE,And she preferred his words of praise
27914,HELIOTROPE,To all the honors of the college.
27915,HELIOTROPE,"Yet ""What am foolish I to him?"""
27916,HELIOTROPE,She whispered to her heart's confessor.

27928,HELIOTROPE,
27929,HELIOTROPE,Nor came she more from day to day

27931,HELIOTROPE,"Above her grave, far, far away,"
27932,HELIOTROPE,The ever-silent snows were drifting;
27933,HELIOTROPE,And those who mourned her winsome face
27934,HELIOTROPE,Found in its stead a swift successor
27935,HELIOTROPE,And loved another in her place -
27936,HELIOTROPE,"All, save the silent old professor."
27937,HELIOTROPE,
27938,HELIOTROPE,"But, in the tender twilight gray,"
27939,HELIOTROPE,"Shut from the sight of carping critic,"
27940,HELIOTROPE,His lonely thoughts would often stray
27941,HELIOTROPE,"From Vedic verse and tongues Semitic,"
27942,HELIOTROPE,Bidding the ghost of vanished hope
27943,HELIOTROPE,Mock with its past the sad possessor
27944,HELIOTROPE,Of the dead spray of heliotrope

28167,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,
28168,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,There came a day when on her heart

28170,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,And the world that still was April

28176,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,No longer was alone.
28177,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,
28178,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,For there had come a little hand

28181,THE WIFE FROM FAIRYLAND,Home through the greenwood - home.

28949,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,While he took my hand as he whispering said -
28950,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"(How the clover lifted each pink, sweet head,"
28951,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,To listen to all that my lover said;
28952,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"Oh, the clover in bloom, I love it!)"
28953,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,
28954,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"In the high, wet grass went the path to hide,"
28955,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And the low, wet leaves hung over;"
28956,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"But I could not pass upon either side,"
28957,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"For I found myself, when I vainly tried,"
28958,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,In the arms of my steadfast lover.
28959,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And he held me there and he raised my head,"
28960,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"While he closed the path before me,"
28961,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,And he looked down into my eyes and said -
28962,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,(How the leaves bent down from the boughs o'erhead
28963,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"To listen to all that my lover said,"
28964,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"Oh, the leaves hanging lowly o'er me!)"
28965,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,
28966,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"Had he moved aside but a little way,"
28967,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,I could surely then have passed him;
28968,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And he knew I never could wish to stay,"
28969,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And would not have heard what he had to say,"
28970,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,Could I only aside have cast him.
28971,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"It was almost dark, and the moments sped,"
28972,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And the searching night wind found us,"
28973,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,But he drew me nearer and softly said -
28974,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"(How the pure, sweet wind grew still, instead,"
28975,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,To listen to all that my lover said;
28976,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"Oh, the whispering wind around us!)"
28977,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,
28978,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"I am sure he knew when he held me fast,"
28979,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,That I must be all unwilling;
28980,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"For I tried to go, and I would have passed,"
28981,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"As the night was come with its dew, at last,"
28982,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,And the sky with its stars was filling.
28983,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"But he clasped me close when I would have fled,"
28984,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And he made me hear his story,"
28985,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,And his soul came out from his lips and said -
28986,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"(How the stars crept out where the white moon led,"
28987,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,To listen to all that my lover said;
28988,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"Oh, the moon and the stars in glory!)"
28989,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,
28990,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"I know that the grass and the leaves will not tell,"
28991,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"And I'm sure that the wind, precious rover,"
28992,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,Will carry my secret so safely and well
28993,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,That no being shall ever discover
28994,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,One word of the many that rapidly fell
28995,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,From the soul-speaking lips of my lover;
28996,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,And the moon and the stars that looked over
28997,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,Shall never reveal what a fairy-like spell
28998,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"They wove round about us that night in the dell,"
28999,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,"In the path through the dew-laden clover,"
29000,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,Nor echo the whispers that made my heart swell
29001,WHAT MY LOVER SAID,As they fell from the lips of my lover.

30126,THE LETTERS,
30127,THE LETTERS,"Still on the tower stood the vane,"
30128,THE LETTERS,A black yew gloomed the stagnant air;
30129,THE LETTERS,"I peered athwart the chancel pane,"
30130,THE LETTERS,And saw the altar cold and bare.
30131,THE LETTERS,"A clog of lead was round my feet,"
30132,THE LETTERS,A band of pain across my brow;
30133,THE LETTERS,"""Cold altar, heaven and earth shall meet"
30134,THE LETTERS,"Before you hear my marriage vow."""
30135,THE LETTERS,
30136,THE LETTERS,I turned and hummed a bitter song
30137,THE LETTERS,"That mocked the wholesome human heart,"
30138,THE LETTERS,"And then we met in wrath and wrong,"
30139,THE LETTERS,"We met, but only meant to part."
30140,THE LETTERS,Full cold my greeting was and dry;
30141,THE LETTERS,"She faintly smiled, she hardly moved;"
30142,THE LETTERS,"I saw, with half-unconscious eye,"
30143,THE LETTERS,She wore the colors I approved.
30144,THE LETTERS,
30145,THE LETTERS,"She took the little ivory chest,"
30146,THE LETTERS,"With half a sigh she turned the key,"
30147,THE LETTERS,"Then raised her head with lips compressed,"
30148,THE LETTERS,And gave my letters back to me;
30149,THE LETTERS,"And gave the trinkets and the rings,"
30150,THE LETTERS,"My gifts, when gifts of mine could please."
30151,THE LETTERS,As looks a father on the things
30152,THE LETTERS,"Of his dead son, I looked on these."
30153,THE LETTERS,
30154,THE LETTERS,She told me all her friends had said;
30155,THE LETTERS,I raged against the public liar.
30156,THE LETTERS,She talked as if her love were dead;
30157,THE LETTERS,But in my words were seeds of fire.
30158,THE LETTERS,"""No more of love, your sex is known;"
30159,THE LETTERS,I never will be twice deceived.
30160,THE LETTERS,Henceforth I trust the man alone;
30161,THE LETTERS,The woman cannot be believed.
30162,THE LETTERS,
30163,THE LETTERS,"""Through slander, meanest spawn of hell, -"
30164,THE LETTERS,"And woman's slander is the worst, -"
30165,THE LETTERS,"And you, whom once I loved so well,"
30166,THE LETTERS,"Through you my life will be accursed."""
30167,THE LETTERS,"I spoke with heart and heat and force,"
30168,THE LETTERS,I shook her breast with vague alarms -
30169,THE LETTERS,Like torrents from a mountain source
30170,THE LETTERS,We rushed into each other's arms.
30171,THE LETTERS,
30172,THE LETTERS,"We parted; sweetly gleamed the stars,"
30173,THE LETTERS,And sweet the vapor-braided blue;
30174,THE LETTERS,"Low breezes fanned the belfry bars,"
30175,THE LETTERS,As homeward by the church I drew.
30176,THE LETTERS,"The very graves appeared to smile,"
30177,THE LETTERS,So fresh they rose in shadowed swells;
30178,THE LETTERS,"""Dark porch,"" I said, ""and silent aisle,"
30179,THE LETTERS,"There comes a sound of marriage bells."""

30185,PROTHALAMION,
30186,PROTHALAMION,"Calm was the day, and through the trembling air"
30187,PROTHALAMION,Sweet-breathing Zephyrus did softly play
30188,PROTHALAMION,"A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay"
30189,PROTHALAMION,"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;"
30190,PROTHALAMION,"When I (whom sullen care,"
30191,PROTHALAMION,Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
30192,PROTHALAMION,"In Prince's Court, and expectation vain"
30193,PROTHALAMION,"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away,"
30194,PROTHALAMION,"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain),"
30195,PROTHALAMION,Walked forth to ease my pain
30196,PROTHALAMION,Along the shore of silver streaming Thames;
30197,PROTHALAMION,"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,"
30198,PROTHALAMION,"Was painted all with variable flowers,"
30199,PROTHALAMION,"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,"
30200,PROTHALAMION,"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,"
30201,PROTHALAMION,And crown their paramours
30202,PROTHALAMION,"Against the bridal day, which is not long:"
30203,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30204,PROTHALAMION,
30205,PROTHALAMION,"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,"
30206,PROTHALAMION,"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,"
30207,PROTHALAMION,"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,"
30208,PROTHALAMION,"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,"
30209,PROTHALAMION,As each had been a bride:
30210,PROTHALAMION,"And each one had a little wicker basket,"
30211,PROTHALAMION,"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,"
30212,PROTHALAMION,"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,"
30213,PROTHALAMION,"And, with fine fingers, cropped full feateously"
30214,PROTHALAMION,The tender stalks on high.
30215,PROTHALAMION,"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,"
30216,PROTHALAMION,"They gathered some; the violet, pallid blue,"
30217,PROTHALAMION,"The little daisy, that at evening closes,"
30218,PROTHALAMION,"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,"
30219,PROTHALAMION,"With store of vermeil roses,"
30220,PROTHALAMION,To deck their bridegroom's posies
30221,PROTHALAMION,"Against the bridal day, which was not long:"
30222,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30223,PROTHALAMION,
30224,PROTHALAMION,With that I saw two swans of goodly hue
30225,PROTHALAMION,Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
30226,PROTHALAMION,Two fairer birds I yet did never see;
30227,PROTHALAMION,"The snow, which doth the top of Pindus strew,"
30228,PROTHALAMION,"Did never whiter shew,"
30229,PROTHALAMION,"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be"
30230,PROTHALAMION,"For love of Leda, whiter did appear;"
30231,PROTHALAMION,"Yet Leda was, they say, as white as he,"
30232,PROTHALAMION,"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near;"
30233,PROTHALAMION,"So purely white they were,"
30234,PROTHALAMION,"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,"
30235,PROTHALAMION,"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare"
30236,PROTHALAMION,"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might"
30237,PROTHALAMION,"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,"
30238,PROTHALAMION,"And mar their beauties bright,"
30239,PROTHALAMION,"That shone as heaven's light,"
30240,PROTHALAMION,"Against their bridal day, which was not long:"
30241,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30242,PROTHALAMION,
30243,PROTHALAMION,"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,"
30244,PROTHALAMION,"Ran all in haste to see that silver brood,"
30245,PROTHALAMION,As they came floating on the crystal flood;
30246,PROTHALAMION,"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,"
30247,PROTHALAMION,Their wondering eyes to fill;
30248,PROTHALAMION,Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair
30249,PROTHALAMION,"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem"
30250,PROTHALAMION,"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair"
30251,PROTHALAMION,Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
30252,PROTHALAMION,For sure they did not seem
30253,PROTHALAMION,"To be begot of any earthly seed,"
30254,PROTHALAMION,"But rather angels, or of angels' breed;"
30255,PROTHALAMION,"Yet were they bred of summer's heat, they say,"
30256,PROTHALAMION,"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed"
30257,PROTHALAMION,The earth did fresh array;
30258,PROTHALAMION,"So fresh they seemed as day,"
30259,PROTHALAMION,"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:"
30260,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30261,PROTHALAMION,
30262,PROTHALAMION,Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
30263,PROTHALAMION,"Great store of flowers, the honor of the field,"
30264,PROTHALAMION,"That to the sense did fragrant odors yield,"
30265,PROTHALAMION,All which upon those goodly birds they threw
30266,PROTHALAMION,"And all the waves did strew,"
30267,PROTHALAMION,"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,"
30268,PROTHALAMION,"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,"
30269,PROTHALAMION,"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,"
30270,PROTHALAMION,"That they appear, through lilies' plenteous store,"
30271,PROTHALAMION,Like a bride's chamber floor:
30272,PROTHALAMION,"Two of those nymphs, meanwhile, two garlands bound"
30273,PROTHALAMION,"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,"
30274,PROTHALAMION,"The which presenting all in trim array,"
30275,PROTHALAMION,"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,"
30276,PROTHALAMION,"Whilst one did sing this lay,"
30277,PROTHALAMION,"Prepared against that day,"
30278,PROTHALAMION,"Against their bridal day, which was not long:"
30279,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30280,PROTHALAMION,
30281,PROTHALAMION,"""Ye gentle birds! the world's fair ornament,"
30282,PROTHALAMION,And heaven's glory whom this happy hour
30283,PROTHALAMION,"Doth lead unto your lover's blissful bower,"
30284,PROTHALAMION,"Joy may you have, and gentle hearts' content"
30285,PROTHALAMION,Of your love's couplement;
30286,PROTHALAMION,"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,"
30287,PROTHALAMION,"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,"
30288,PROTHALAMION,"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove"
30289,PROTHALAMION,"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile"
30290,PROTHALAMION,For ever to assoil;
30291,PROTHALAMION,"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,"
30292,PROTHALAMION,And blessed plenty wait upon your board;
30293,PROTHALAMION,"And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,"
30294,PROTHALAMION,"That fruitful issue may to you afford,"
30295,PROTHALAMION,"Which may your foes confound,"
30296,PROTHALAMION,And make your joys redound
30297,PROTHALAMION,"Upon your bridal day, which is not long"":"
30298,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30299,PROTHALAMION,
30300,PROTHALAMION,So ended she: and all the rest around
30301,PROTHALAMION,"To her redoubled that her undersong,"
30302,PROTHALAMION,Which said their bridal day should not be long:
30303,PROTHALAMION,And gentle Echo from the neighbor-ground
30304,PROTHALAMION,Their accents did resound.
30305,PROTHALAMION,"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,"
30306,PROTHALAMION,"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,"
30307,PROTHALAMION,"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,"
30308,PROTHALAMION,"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,"
30309,PROTHALAMION,Making his stream run slow.
30310,PROTHALAMION,And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
30311,PROTHALAMION,"'Gan flock about these twain, that did excel"
30312,PROTHALAMION,"The rest, so far as Cynthia doth shend"
30313,PROTHALAMION,"The lesser stars.  So they, enranged well,"
30314,PROTHALAMION,"Did on those two attend,"
30315,PROTHALAMION,And their best service lend
30316,PROTHALAMION,"Against their wedding day, which was not long:"
30317,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30318,PROTHALAMION,
30319,PROTHALAMION,"At length they all to merry London came,"
30320,PROTHALAMION,"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,"
30321,PROTHALAMION,That to me gave this life's first native source;
30322,PROTHALAMION,"Though from another place I take my name,"
30323,PROTHALAMION,An house of ancient fame:
30324,PROTHALAMION,"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers"
30325,PROTHALAMION,"The which on Thames' broad, aged back do ride,"
30326,PROTHALAMION,"Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,"
30327,PROTHALAMION,"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,"
30328,PROTHALAMION,Till they decayed through pride:
30329,PROTHALAMION,"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,"
30330,PROTHALAMION,Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
30331,PROTHALAMION,"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,"
30332,PROTHALAMION,Whose want too well now feels my friendless case;
30333,PROTHALAMION,But ah! here fits not well
30334,PROTHALAMION,"Old woes, but joys, to tell"
30335,PROTHALAMION,"Against the bridal day, which is not long:"
30336,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30337,PROTHALAMION,
30338,PROTHALAMION,"Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,"
30339,PROTHALAMION,"Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,"
30340,PROTHALAMION,"Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,"
30341,PROTHALAMION,And Hercules' two pillars standing near
30342,PROTHALAMION,Did make to quake and fear:
30343,PROTHALAMION,"Fair branch of honor, flower of chivalry!"
30344,PROTHALAMION,"That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,"
30345,PROTHALAMION,"Joy have thou of thy noble victory,"
30346,PROTHALAMION,"And endless happiness of thine own name,"
30347,PROTHALAMION,That promiseth the same;
30348,PROTHALAMION,"That through thy prowess, and victorious arms,"
30349,PROTHALAMION,Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
30350,PROTHALAMION,And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
30351,PROTHALAMION,"Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,"
30352,PROTHALAMION,Which some brave muse may sing
30353,PROTHALAMION,"To ages following,"
30354,PROTHALAMION,"Upon the bridal day, which is not long:"
30355,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."
30356,PROTHALAMION,
30357,PROTHALAMION,"From those high towers this noble lord issuing,"
30358,PROTHALAMION,"Like radiant Hesper, when his golden hair"
30359,PROTHALAMION,"In the ocean billows he hath bathed fair,"
30360,PROTHALAMION,"Descended to the river's open viewing,"
30361,PROTHALAMION,With a great train ensuing.
30362,PROTHALAMION,Above the rest were goodly to be seen
30363,PROTHALAMION,Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
30364,PROTHALAMION,"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,"
30365,PROTHALAMION,"With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,"
30366,PROTHALAMION,"Fit for so goodly stature,"
30367,PROTHALAMION,"That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,"
30368,PROTHALAMION,Which deck the baldrick of the heavens bright;
30369,PROTHALAMION,"They two, forth pacing to the river's side,"
30370,PROTHALAMION,"Received those two fair brides, their love's delight;"
30371,PROTHALAMION,"Which, at the appointed tide,"
30372,PROTHALAMION,Each one did make his bride
30373,PROTHALAMION,"Against their bridal day, which is not long:"
30374,PROTHALAMION,"Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song."

30381,EPITHALAMION,"Ye learned sisters, which have oftentimes"
30382,EPITHALAMION,"Been to me aiding, others to adorn,"
30383,EPITHALAMION,"Whom ye thought worthy of your graceful rhymes,"
30384,EPITHALAMION,That even the greatest did not greatly scorn
30385,EPITHALAMION,"To hear their names sung in your simple lays,"
30386,EPITHALAMION,But joyed in their praise;
30387,EPITHALAMION,"And when ye list your own mishaps to mourn,"
30388,EPITHALAMION,"Which death, or love, or fortune's wreck did raise,"
30389,EPITHALAMION,"Your string could soon to sadder tenor turn,"
30390,EPITHALAMION,And teach the woods and waters to lament
30391,EPITHALAMION,Your doleful dreariment:
30392,EPITHALAMION,Now lay those sorrowful complaints aside;
30393,EPITHALAMION,"And, having all your heads with garlands crowned,"
30394,EPITHALAMION,Help me mine own love's praises to resound;
30395,EPITHALAMION,Nor let the same of any be envide:
30396,EPITHALAMION,So Orpheus did for his own bride!
30397,EPITHALAMION,So I unto myself alone will sing;
30398,EPITHALAMION,"The woods shall to me answer, and my echo ring."
30399,EPITHALAMION,
30400,EPITHALAMION,"Early, before the world's light-giving lamp"
30401,EPITHALAMION,"His golden beam upon the hills doth spread,"
30402,EPITHALAMION,"Having dispersed the night's uncheerful damp,"
30403,EPITHALAMION,"Do ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-hed,"
30404,EPITHALAMION,"Go to the bower of my beloved love,"
30405,EPITHALAMION,My truest turtle dove;
30406,EPITHALAMION,"Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,"
30407,EPITHALAMION,"And long since ready forth his mask to move,"
30408,EPITHALAMION,"With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake,"
30409,EPITHALAMION,"And many a bachelor to wait on him,"
30410,EPITHALAMION,In their fresh garments trim.
30411,EPITHALAMION,"Bid her awake therefore, and soon her dight,"
30412,EPITHALAMION,"For lo! the wished day is come at last,"
30413,EPITHALAMION,"That shall, for all the pains and sorrows past,"
30414,EPITHALAMION,Pay to her usury of long delight:
30415,EPITHALAMION,"And, whilst she doth her dight,"
30416,EPITHALAMION,"Do ye to her of joy and solace sing,"
30417,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
30418,EPITHALAMION,
30419,EPITHALAMION,"Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear,"
30420,EPITHALAMION,"Both of the rivers and the forests green,"
30421,EPITHALAMION,"And of the sea that neighbors to her near,"
30422,EPITHALAMION,All with gay garlands goodly well beseen.
30423,EPITHALAMION,And let them also with them bring in hand
30424,EPITHALAMION,"Another gay garland,"
30425,EPITHALAMION,"For my fair love, of lilies and of roses,"
30426,EPITHALAMION,Bound truelove wise with a blue silk riband;
30427,EPITHALAMION,"And let them make great store of bridal posies,"
30428,EPITHALAMION,"And let them eke bring store of other flowers,"
30429,EPITHALAMION,To deck the bridal bowers.
30430,EPITHALAMION,"And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,"
30431,EPITHALAMION,"For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong,"
30432,EPITHALAMION,"Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,"
30433,EPITHALAMION,And diapered like the discolored mead;
30434,EPITHALAMION,"Which done, do at her chamber door await,"
30435,EPITHALAMION,For she will waken straight;
30436,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles do ye this song unto her sing,"
30437,EPITHALAMION,"The woods shall to you answer, and your echo ring."
30438,EPITHALAMION,
30439,EPITHALAMION,"Ye Nymphs of Mulla, which with careful heed"
30440,EPITHALAMION,"The silver scaly trouts do tend full well,"
30441,EPITHALAMION,And greedy pikes which use therein to feed
30442,EPITHALAMION,(Those trouts and pikes all others do excel);
30443,EPITHALAMION,"And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,"
30444,EPITHALAMION,Where none do fishes take;
30445,EPITHALAMION,"Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light,"
30446,EPITHALAMION,"And in his waters, which your mirror make,"
30447,EPITHALAMION,"Behold your faces as the crystal bright,"
30448,EPITHALAMION,"That when you come whereas my love doth lie,"
30449,EPITHALAMION,No blemish she may spy.
30450,EPITHALAMION,"And eke, ye lightfoot maids, which keep the deer,"
30451,EPITHALAMION,That on the hoary mountain used to tower;
30452,EPITHALAMION,"And the wild wolves, which seek them to devour,"
30453,EPITHALAMION,With your steel darts do chase from coming near;
30454,EPITHALAMION,"Be also present here,"
30455,EPITHALAMION,"To help to deck her, and to help to sing,"
30456,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
30457,EPITHALAMION,
30458,EPITHALAMION,"Wake, now, my love, awake! for it is time;"
30459,EPITHALAMION,"The rosy mom long since left Tithon's bed,"
30460,EPITHALAMION,All ready to her silver coach to climb;
30461,EPITHALAMION,And Phoebus 'gins to show his glorious head.
30462,EPITHALAMION,"Hark, how the cheerful birds do chant their lays"
30463,EPITHALAMION,And carol of love's praise.
30464,EPITHALAMION,The merry lark her matins sings aloft;
30465,EPITHALAMION,The thrush replies; the mavis descant plays;
30466,EPITHALAMION,The ouzel shrills; the ruddock warbles soft;
30467,EPITHALAMION,"So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,"
30468,EPITHALAMION,To this day's merriment.
30469,EPITHALAMION,"Ah! my dear love, why do ye sleep thus long,"
30470,EPITHALAMION,"When meeter were that ye should now awake,"
30471,EPITHALAMION,"To await the coming of your joyous mate,"
30472,EPITHALAMION,"And hearken to the birds' love-learned song,"
30473,EPITHALAMION,The dewy leaves among!
30474,EPITHALAMION,"For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,"
30475,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring."
30476,EPITHALAMION,
30477,EPITHALAMION,"My love is now awake out of her dreams,"
30478,EPITHALAMION,"And her fair eyes, like stars that dimmed were"
30479,EPITHALAMION,"With darksome cloud, now show their goodly beams"
30480,EPITHALAMION,More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear.
30481,EPITHALAMION,"Come now, ye damsels, daughters of delight,"
30482,EPITHALAMION,Help quickly her to dight:
30483,EPITHALAMION,"But first come, ye fair hours, which were begot"
30484,EPITHALAMION,In Jove's sweet paradise of Day and Night;
30485,EPITHALAMION,"Which do the seasons of the year allot,"
30486,EPITHALAMION,"And all that ever in this world is fair,"
30487,EPITHALAMION,Do make and still repair:
30488,EPITHALAMION,"And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian queen,"
30489,EPITHALAMION,"The which do still adorn her beauty's pride,"
30490,EPITHALAMION,Help to adorn my beautifulest bride;
30491,EPITHALAMION,"And as ye her array, still throw between"
30492,EPITHALAMION,"Some graces to be seen,"
30493,EPITHALAMION,"And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,"
30494,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the woods shall answer, and your echo ring."
30495,EPITHALAMION,
30496,EPITHALAMION,Now is my love all ready forth to come:
30497,EPITHALAMION,Let all the virgins therefore well await:
30498,EPITHALAMION,"And ye fresh boys, that tend upon her groom,"
30499,EPITHALAMION,Prepare yourselves; for he is coming straight;
30500,EPITHALAMION,"Set all your things in seemly good array,"
30501,EPITHALAMION,Fit for so joyful day:
30502,EPITHALAMION,The joyfulest day that ever sun did see.
30503,EPITHALAMION,"Fair Sun! show forth thy favorable ray,"
30504,EPITHALAMION,"And let thy life-full heat not fervent be,"
30505,EPITHALAMION,"For fear of burning her sunshiny face,"
30506,EPITHALAMION,Her beauty to disgrace.
30507,EPITHALAMION,O fairest Phoebus! father of the Muse!
30508,EPITHALAMION,"If ever I did honor thee aright,"
30509,EPITHALAMION,"Or sing the thing that might thy mind delight,"
30510,EPITHALAMION,Do not thy servant's simple boon refuse;
30511,EPITHALAMION,"But let this day, let this one day, be mine;"
30512,EPITHALAMION,Let all the rest be thine.
30513,EPITHALAMION,"Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing,"
30514,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods shall answer, and their echo ring."
30515,EPITHALAMION,
30516,EPITHALAMION,Hark! how the Minstrels 'gin to shrill aloud
30517,EPITHALAMION,"Their merry music that resounds from far,"
30518,EPITHALAMION,"The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling croud,"
30519,EPITHALAMION,That well agree withouten breach or jar.
30520,EPITHALAMION,"But, most of all, the Damsels do delight"
30521,EPITHALAMION,"When they their timbrels smite,"
30522,EPITHALAMION,"And thereunto do dance and carol sweet,"
30523,EPITHALAMION,That all the senses they do ravish quite;
30524,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the boys run up and down the street,"
30525,EPITHALAMION,"Crying aloud with strong confused noise,"
30526,EPITHALAMION,"As if it were one voice,"
30527,EPITHALAMION,"Hymen, io Hymen, Hymen, they do shout;"
30528,EPITHALAMION,That even to the heavens their shouting shrill
30529,EPITHALAMION,"Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;"
30530,EPITHALAMION,"To which the people standing all about,"
30531,EPITHALAMION,"As in approvance, do thereto applaud,"
30532,EPITHALAMION,And loud advance her laud;
30533,EPITHALAMION,"And evermore they Hymen, Hymen sing,"
30534,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring."
30535,EPITHALAMION,
30536,EPITHALAMION,"Lo! where she comes along with portly pace,"
30537,EPITHALAMION,"Like Phoebe, from her chamber of the East,"
30538,EPITHALAMION,"Arising forth to run her mighty race,"
30539,EPITHALAMION,"Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best."
30540,EPITHALAMION,"So well it her beseems, that ye would ween"
30541,EPITHALAMION,Some angel she had been.
30542,EPITHALAMION,"Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire,"
30543,EPITHALAMION,"Sprinkled with pearl, and pearling flowers atween,"
30544,EPITHALAMION,Do like a golden mantle her attire;
30545,EPITHALAMION,"And, being crowned with a garland green,"
30546,EPITHALAMION,Seem like some maiden queen.
30547,EPITHALAMION,"Her modest eyes, abashed to behold"
30548,EPITHALAMION,"So many gazers as on her do stare,"
30549,EPITHALAMION,Upon the lowly ground affixed are;
30550,EPITHALAMION,"Nor dare lift up her countenance too bold,"
30551,EPITHALAMION,"But blush to hear her praises sung so loud,"
30552,EPITHALAMION,So far from being proud.
30553,EPITHALAMION,"Nathless do ye still loud her praises sing,"
30554,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
30555,EPITHALAMION,
30556,EPITHALAMION,"Tell me, ye merchants' daughters, did ye see"
30557,EPITHALAMION,So fair a creature in your town before;
30558,EPITHALAMION,"So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,"
30559,EPITHALAMION,Adorned with beauty's grace and virtue's store?
30560,EPITHALAMION,"Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright,"
30561,EPITHALAMION,"Her forehead ivory white,"
30562,EPITHALAMION,"Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied,"
30563,EPITHALAMION,"Her lips like cherries charming men to bite,"
30564,EPITHALAMION,"Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded,"
30565,EPITHALAMION,"Her paps like lilies budded,"
30566,EPITHALAMION,Her snowy neck like to a marble tower;
30567,EPITHALAMION,"And all her body like a palace fair,"
30568,EPITHALAMION,"Ascending up, with many a stately stair,"
30569,EPITHALAMION,To honor's seat and chastity's sweet bower.
30570,EPITHALAMION,"Why stand ye still, ye virgins, in amaze,"
30571,EPITHALAMION,"Upon her so to gaze,"
30572,EPITHALAMION,"Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,"
30573,EPITHALAMION,"To which the woods did answer, and your echo ring?"
30574,EPITHALAMION,
30575,EPITHALAMION,"But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,"
30576,EPITHALAMION,"The inward beauty of her lively spright,"
30577,EPITHALAMION,"Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree,"
30578,EPITHALAMION,"Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,"
30579,EPITHALAMION,And stand astonished like to those which read
30580,EPITHALAMION,Medusa's mazeful head.
30581,EPITHALAMION,"There dwells sweet love, and constant chastity,"
30582,EPITHALAMION,"Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,"
30583,EPITHALAMION,"Regard of honor, and mild modesty;"
30584,EPITHALAMION,"There virtue reigns as queen in royal throne,"
30585,EPITHALAMION,"And giveth laws alone,"
30586,EPITHALAMION,"The which the base affections do obey,"
30587,EPITHALAMION,And yield their services unto her will;
30588,EPITHALAMION,Nor thought of thing uncomely ever may
30589,EPITHALAMION,Thereto approach to tempt her mind to ill.
30590,EPITHALAMION,"Had ye once seen these her celestial treasures,"
30591,EPITHALAMION,"And unrevealed pleasures,"
30592,EPITHALAMION,"Then would ye wonder, and her praises sing,"
30593,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods should answer, and your echo ring."
30594,EPITHALAMION,
30595,EPITHALAMION,"Open the temple gates unto my love,"
30596,EPITHALAMION,"Open them wide that she may enter in,"
30597,EPITHALAMION,"And all the posts adorn as doth behove,"
30598,EPITHALAMION,"And all the pillars deck with garlands trim,"
30599,EPITHALAMION,"For to receive this Saint with honor due,"
30600,EPITHALAMION,That cometh in to you.
30601,EPITHALAMION,"With trembling steps, and humble reverence,"
30602,EPITHALAMION,"She cometh in, before the Almighty's view;"
30603,EPITHALAMION,"Of her ye virgins learn obedience,"
30604,EPITHALAMION,"When so ye come into those holy places,"
30605,EPITHALAMION,To humble your proud faces:
30606,EPITHALAMION,"Bring her up to the high altar, that she may"
30607,EPITHALAMION,"The sacred ceremonies there partake,"
30608,EPITHALAMION,The which do endless matrimony make;
30609,EPITHALAMION,And let the roaring organs loudly play
30610,EPITHALAMION,The praises of the Lord in lively notes;
30611,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles, with hollow throats,"
30612,EPITHALAMION,"The Choristers the joyous Anthems sing,"
30613,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and their echo ring."
30614,EPITHALAMION,
30615,EPITHALAMION,"Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,"
30616,EPITHALAMION,"Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,"
30617,EPITHALAMION,"And blesseth her with his two happy hands,"
30618,EPITHALAMION,"How the red roses flush up in her cheeks,"
30619,EPITHALAMION,"And the pure snow, with goodly vermill stain"
30620,EPITHALAMION,Like crimson dyed in grain:
30621,EPITHALAMION,"That even the Angels, which continually"
30622,EPITHALAMION,"About the sacred altar do remain,"
30623,EPITHALAMION,"Forget their service and about her fly,"
30624,EPITHALAMION,"Oft peeping in her face, that seems more fair,"
30625,EPITHALAMION,The more they on it stare.
30626,EPITHALAMION,"But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,"
30627,EPITHALAMION,"Are governed with goodly modesty,"
30628,EPITHALAMION,"That suffers not one look to glance awry,"
30629,EPITHALAMION,Which may let in a little thought unsound.
30630,EPITHALAMION,"Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,"
30631,EPITHALAMION,The pledge of all our band?
30632,EPITHALAMION,"Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluja sing,"
30633,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
30634,EPITHALAMION,
30635,EPITHALAMION,Now all is done: bring home the bride again;
30636,EPITHALAMION,Bring home the triumph of our victory:
30637,EPITHALAMION,Bring home with you the glory of her gain;
30638,EPITHALAMION,With joyance bring her and with jollity.
30639,EPITHALAMION,"Never had man more joyful day than this,"
30640,EPITHALAMION,Whom heaven would heap with bliss.
30641,EPITHALAMION,Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;
30642,EPITHALAMION,This day for ever to me holy is.
30643,EPITHALAMION,"Pour out the wine without restraint or stay,"
30644,EPITHALAMION,"Pour not by cups, but by the belly full,"
30645,EPITHALAMION,"Pour out to all that will,"
30646,EPITHALAMION,"And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine,"
30647,EPITHALAMION,"That they may sweat, and drunken be withal."
30648,EPITHALAMION,"Crown ye God Bacchus with a coronal,"
30649,EPITHALAMION,And Hymen also crown with wreaths of vine;
30650,EPITHALAMION,"And let the Graces dance unto the rest,"
30651,EPITHALAMION,For they can do it best:
30652,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the maidens do their carol sing,"
30653,EPITHALAMION,"To which the woods shall answer, and their echo ring."
30654,EPITHALAMION,
30655,EPITHALAMION,"Ring ye the bells, ye young men of the town,"
30656,EPITHALAMION,And leave your wonted labors for this day:
30657,EPITHALAMION,"This day is holy; do ye write it down,"
30658,EPITHALAMION,That ye for ever it remember may.
30659,EPITHALAMION,"This day the sun is in his chiefest height,"
30660,EPITHALAMION,"With Barnaby the bright,"
30661,EPITHALAMION,"From whence declining daily by degrees,"
30662,EPITHALAMION,"He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,"
30663,EPITHALAMION,When once the Crab behind his back he sees.
30664,EPITHALAMION,"But for this time it ill ordained was,"
30665,EPITHALAMION,"To choose the longest day in all the year,"
30666,EPITHALAMION,"And shortest night, when longest fitter were:"
30667,EPITHALAMION,"Yet never day so long, but late would pass."
30668,EPITHALAMION,"Ring ye the bells, to make it wear away,"
30669,EPITHALAMION,And bonfires make all day;
30670,EPITHALAMION,"And dance about them, and about them sing,"
30671,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
30672,EPITHALAMION,
30673,EPITHALAMION,"Ah! when will this long weary day have end,"
30674,EPITHALAMION,And lend me leave to come unto my love?
30675,EPITHALAMION,How slowly do the hours their numbers spend?
30676,EPITHALAMION,How slowly does sad Time his feathers move?
30677,EPITHALAMION,"Haste thee, O fairest Planet, to thy home,"
30678,EPITHALAMION,Within the Western foam:
30679,EPITHALAMION,Thy tired steeds long since have need of rest.
30680,EPITHALAMION,"Long though it be, at last I see it gloom,"
30681,EPITHALAMION,And the bright evening-star with golden crest
30682,EPITHALAMION,Appear out of the East.
30683,EPITHALAMION,Fair child of beauty! glorious lamp of love!
30684,EPITHALAMION,"That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead,"
30685,EPITHALAMION,"And guidest lovers through the night's sad dread,"
30686,EPITHALAMION,"How cheerfully thou lookest from above,"
30687,EPITHALAMION,"And seems to laugh atween thy twinkling light,"
30688,EPITHALAMION,As joying in the sight
30689,EPITHALAMION,"Of these glad many, which for joy do sing,"
30690,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring!"
30691,EPITHALAMION,
30692,EPITHALAMION,"Now, cease, ye damsels, your delights fore-past;"
30693,EPITHALAMION,Enough is it that all the day was yours:
30694,EPITHALAMION,"Now day is done, and night is nighing fast,"
30695,EPITHALAMION,Now bring the bride into the bridal bowers.
30696,EPITHALAMION,"The night is come, now soon her disarray,"
30697,EPITHALAMION,And in her bed her lay;
30698,EPITHALAMION,"Lay her in lilies and in violets,"
30699,EPITHALAMION,"And silken curtains over her display,"
30700,EPITHALAMION,"And odored sheets, and Arras coverlets."
30701,EPITHALAMION,"Behold how goodly my fair love does lie,"
30702,EPITHALAMION,In proud humility!
30703,EPITHALAMION,"Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took"
30704,EPITHALAMION,"In Tempe, lying on the flowery grass,"
30705,EPITHALAMION,"'Twixt sleep and wake, after she weary was,"
30706,EPITHALAMION,With bathing in the Acidalian brook.
30707,EPITHALAMION,"Now it is night, ye damsels may be gone,"
30708,EPITHALAMION,"And leave my love alone,"
30709,EPITHALAMION,And leave likewise your former lay to sing:
30710,EPITHALAMION,"The woods no more shall answer, nor your echo ring."
30711,EPITHALAMION,
30712,EPITHALAMION,"Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,"
30713,EPITHALAMION,"That long day's labor dost at last defray,"
30714,EPITHALAMION,"And all my cares, which cruel Love collected,"
30715,EPITHALAMION,"Hast summed in one, and cancelled for aye:"
30716,EPITHALAMION,"Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,"
30717,EPITHALAMION,That no man may us see;
30718,EPITHALAMION,"And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,"
30719,EPITHALAMION,From fear of peril and foul horror free.
30720,EPITHALAMION,"Let no false treason seek us to entrap,"
30721,EPITHALAMION,Nor any dread disquiet once annoy
30722,EPITHALAMION,The safety of our joy;
30723,EPITHALAMION,"But let the night be calm, and quietsome,"
30724,EPITHALAMION,Without tempestuous storms or sad affray:
30725,EPITHALAMION,"Like as when Jove with fair Alcmena lay,"
30726,EPITHALAMION,When he begot the great Tirynthian groom:
30727,EPITHALAMION,Or like as when he with thyself did lie
30728,EPITHALAMION,And begot Majesty.
30729,EPITHALAMION,And let the maids and young men cease to sing;
30730,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring."
30731,EPITHALAMION,
30732,EPITHALAMION,"Let no lamenting cries, nor doleful tears,"
30733,EPITHALAMION,"Be heard all night within, nor yet without:"
30734,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let false whispers, breeding hidden fears,"
30735,EPITHALAMION,Break gentle sleep with misconceived doubt.
30736,EPITHALAMION,"Let no deluding dreams, nor dreadful sights,"
30737,EPITHALAMION,Make sudden sad affrights;
30738,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let house-fires, nor lightning's helpless harms,"
30739,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let the Puck, nor other evil sprites,"
30740,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let mischievous witches with their charms,"
30741,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let hobgoblins, names whose sense we see not,"
30742,EPITHALAMION,Fray us with things that be not:
30743,EPITHALAMION,"Let not the screech-owl nor the stork be heard,"
30744,EPITHALAMION,"Nor the night raven, that still deadly yells;"
30745,EPITHALAMION,"Nor damned ghosts, called up with mighty spells,"
30746,EPITHALAMION,"Nor grizzly vultures, make us once afraid:"
30747,EPITHALAMION,Nor let the unpleasant choir of frogs still croaking
30748,EPITHALAMION,Make us to wish their choking.
30749,EPITHALAMION,Let none of these their dreary accents sing;
30750,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring."
30751,EPITHALAMION,
30752,EPITHALAMION,"But let still Silence true night-watches keep,"
30753,EPITHALAMION,"That sacred Peace may in assurance reign,"
30754,EPITHALAMION,"And timely Sleep, when it is time to sleep,"
30755,EPITHALAMION,May pour his limbs forth on your pleasant plain;
30756,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles an hundred little winged loves,"
30757,EPITHALAMION,"Like divers-feathered doves,"
30758,EPITHALAMION,"Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,"
30759,EPITHALAMION,"And in the secret dark, that none reproves,"
30760,EPITHALAMION,"Their pretty stealths shall work, and snares shall spread"
30761,EPITHALAMION,"To filch away sweet snatches of delight,"
30762,EPITHALAMION,Concealed through covert night.
30763,EPITHALAMION,"Ye sons of Venus, play your sports at will!"
30764,EPITHALAMION,"For greedy pleasure, careless of your toys,"
30765,EPITHALAMION,"Thinks more upon her paradise of joys,"
30766,EPITHALAMION,"Then what ye do, albeit good or ill."
30767,EPITHALAMION,"All night therefore attend your merry play,"
30768,EPITHALAMION,For it will soon be day:
30769,EPITHALAMION,"Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;"
30770,EPITHALAMION,"Nor will the woods now answer, nor your echo ring."
30771,EPITHALAMION,
30772,EPITHALAMION,"Who is the same, which at my window peeps?"
30773,EPITHALAMION,Or whose is that fair face that shines so bright?
30774,EPITHALAMION,"Is it not Cynthia, she that never sleeps,"
30775,EPITHALAMION,But walks about high heaven all the night?
30776,EPITHALAMION,"O! fairest goddess, do thou not envy"
30777,EPITHALAMION,My love with me to spy:
30778,EPITHALAMION,"For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,"
30779,EPITHALAMION,"And for a fleece of wool, which privily"
30780,EPITHALAMION,"The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,"
30781,EPITHALAMION,His pleasures with thee wrought.
30782,EPITHALAMION,Therefore to us be favorable now;
30783,EPITHALAMION,"And since of women's labors thou hast charge,"
30784,EPITHALAMION,"And generation goodly dost enlarge,"
30785,EPITHALAMION,"Incline thy will to effect our wishful vow,"
30786,EPITHALAMION,"And the chaste womb inform with timely seed,"
30787,EPITHALAMION,That may our comfort breed:
30788,EPITHALAMION,Till which we cease our hopeful hap to sing;
30789,EPITHALAMION,"Nor let the woods us answer, nor our echo ring."
30790,EPITHALAMION,
30791,EPITHALAMION,"And thou, great Juno! which with awful might"
30792,EPITHALAMION,"The laws of wedlock still dost patronize,"
30793,EPITHALAMION,And the religion of the faith first plight
30794,EPITHALAMION,With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize;
30795,EPITHALAMION,And eke for comfort often called art
30796,EPITHALAMION,Of women in their smart;
30797,EPITHALAMION,"Eternally bind thou this lovely band,"
30798,EPITHALAMION,And all thy blessings unto us impart.
30799,EPITHALAMION,"And thou, glad Genius! in whose gentle hand"
30800,EPITHALAMION,"The bridal bower and genial bed remain,"
30801,EPITHALAMION,Without blemish or stain;
30802,EPITHALAMION,And the sweet pleasures of their love's delight
30803,EPITHALAMION,"With secret aid dost succor and supply,"
30804,EPITHALAMION,Till they bring forth the fruitful progeny;
30805,EPITHALAMION,Send us the timely fruit of this same night.
30806,EPITHALAMION,"And thou, fair Hebe! and thou, Hymen free!"
30807,EPITHALAMION,Grant that it may so be.
30808,EPITHALAMION,Till which we cease your further praise to sing;
30809,EPITHALAMION,"Nor any woods shall answer, nor your echo ring."
30810,EPITHALAMION,
30811,EPITHALAMION,"And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,"
30812,EPITHALAMION,In which a thousand torches flaming bright
30813,EPITHALAMION,"Do burn, that to us wretched earthly clods"
30814,EPITHALAMION,In dreadful darkness lend desired light;
30815,EPITHALAMION,"And all ye powers which in the same remain,"
30816,EPITHALAMION,"More than we men can feign,"
30817,EPITHALAMION,"Pour out your blessing on us plenteously,"
30818,EPITHALAMION,"And happy influence upon us rain,"
30819,EPITHALAMION,"That-we may raise a large posterity,"
30820,EPITHALAMION,"Which from the earth, which they may long possess"
30821,EPITHALAMION,"With lasting happiness,"
30822,EPITHALAMION,Up to your haughty palaces may mount;
30823,EPITHALAMION,"And, for the guerdon of their glorious merit,"
30824,EPITHALAMION,"May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,"
30825,EPITHALAMION,Of blessed Saints for to increase the count.
30826,EPITHALAMION,"So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,"
30827,EPITHALAMION,And cease till then our timely joys to sing:
30828,EPITHALAMION,"The woods no more us answer, nor our echo ring!"
30829,EPITHALAMION,
30830,EPITHALAMION,"Song! made in lieu of many ornaments,"
30831,EPITHALAMION,"With which my love should duly have been decked,"
30832,EPITHALAMION,"Which cutting off through hasty accidents,"
30833,EPITHALAMION,"Ye would not stay your due time to expect,"
30834,EPITHALAMION,But promised both to recompense;
30835,EPITHALAMION,"Be unto her a goodly ornament,"
30836,EPITHALAMION,And for short time an endless monument.

32307,THE EXEQUY,"From thy grieved friend, whom thou might'st see"
32308,THE EXEQUY,Quite melted into tears for thee.
32309,THE EXEQUY,"Dear loss! since thy untimely fate,"
32310,THE EXEQUY,My task hath been to meditate
32311,THE EXEQUY,"On thee, on thee: thou art the book,"
32312,THE EXEQUY,"The library whereon I look,"
32313,THE EXEQUY,Though almost blind.  For thee (loved clay)
32314,THE EXEQUY,"I languish out, not live, the day,"
32315,THE EXEQUY,Using no other exercise
32316,THE EXEQUY,But which I practise with mine eyes:
32317,THE EXEQUY,By which wet glasses I find out
32318,THE EXEQUY,How lazily time creeps about
32319,THE EXEQUY,"To one that mourns: this, only this,"
32320,THE EXEQUY,My exercise and business is:

32322,THE EXEQUY,With sighs dissolved into showers.
32323,THE EXEQUY,
32324,THE EXEQUY,Nor wonder if my time go thus
32325,THE EXEQUY,Backward and most preposterous;
32326,THE EXEQUY,Thou hast benighted me; thy set

32334,THE EXEQUY,But thou wilt never more appear
32335,THE EXEQUY,"Folded within my hemisphere,"
32336,THE EXEQUY,"Since both thy light and motion,"
32337,THE EXEQUY,"Like a fled star, is fallen and gone,"
32338,THE EXEQUY,And 'twixt me and my soul's dear wish
32339,THE EXEQUY,"The earth now interposed is,"
32340,THE EXEQUY,Which such a strange eclipse doth make
32341,THE EXEQUY,As ne'er was read in almanac.
32342,THE EXEQUY,
32343,THE EXEQUY,I could allow thee for a time

32347,THE EXEQUY,"And all that space my mirth adjourn,"

32349,THE EXEQUY,And putting off thy ashy shroud
32350,THE EXEQUY,At length disperse this sorrow's cloud.
32351,THE EXEQUY,But woe is me! the longest date
32352,THE EXEQUY,Too narrow is to calculate
32353,THE EXEQUY,These empty hopes: never shall I
32354,THE EXEQUY,Be so much blest as to descry
32355,THE EXEQUY,"A glimpse of thee, till that day come"
32356,THE EXEQUY,"Which shall the earth to cinders doom,"
32357,THE EXEQUY,And a fierce fever must calcine
32358,THE EXEQUY,"The body of this world - like thine,"
32359,THE EXEQUY,(My little world!)  That fit of fire
32360,THE EXEQUY,"Once off, our bodies shall aspire"
32361,THE EXEQUY,To our souls' bliss: then we shall rise
32362,THE EXEQUY,And view ourselves with clearer eyes

32366,THE EXEQUY,"Meantime thou hast her, earth: much good"

32370,THE EXEQUY,My short-lived right and interest
32371,THE EXEQUY,In her whom living I loved best:
32372,THE EXEQUY,With a most free and bounteous grief
32373,THE EXEQUY,I give thee what I could not keep.
32374,THE EXEQUY,"Be kind to her, and prithee look"
32375,THE EXEQUY,Thou write into thy Doomsday book
32376,THE EXEQUY,Each parcel of this rarity
32377,THE EXEQUY,"Which in thy casket shrined doth lie,"
32378,THE EXEQUY,"See that thou make thy reckoning straight,"
32379,THE EXEQUY,And yield her back again by weight;
32380,THE EXEQUY,For thou must audit on thy trust
32381,THE EXEQUY,"Each grain and atom of this dust,"
32382,THE EXEQUY,As thou wilt answer Him that lent -
32383,THE EXEQUY,Not gave - thee my dear monument.
32384,THE EXEQUY,"So close the ground, and 'bout her shade"
32385,THE EXEQUY,Black curtains draw: my bride is laid.
32386,THE EXEQUY,
32387,THE EXEQUY,"Sleep on, my Love, in thy cold bed"
32388,THE EXEQUY,Never to be disquieted!
32389,THE EXEQUY,My last good-night!  Thou wilt not wake
32390,THE EXEQUY,Till I thy fate shall overtake:
32391,THE EXEQUY,"Till age, or grief, or sickness must"
32392,THE EXEQUY,Marry my body to that dust
32393,THE EXEQUY,It so much loves; and fill the room
32394,THE EXEQUY,My heart keeps empty in thy tomb.
32395,THE EXEQUY,Stay for me there: I will not fail
32396,THE EXEQUY,To meet thee in that hollow vale.
32397,THE EXEQUY,And think not much of my delay:
32398,THE EXEQUY,"I am already on the way,"
32399,THE EXEQUY,And follow thee with all the speed
32400,THE EXEQUY,"Desire can make, or sorrows breed."
32401,THE EXEQUY,Each minute is a short degree
32402,THE EXEQUY,And every hour a step towards thee.
32403,THE EXEQUY,"At night when I betake to rest,"

32405,THE EXEQUY,"Of life, almost by eight hours' sail,"

32407,THE EXEQUY,
32408,THE EXEQUY,"Thus from the Sun my bottom steers,"
32409,THE EXEQUY,And my day's compass downward bears:
32410,THE EXEQUY,Nor labor I to stem the tide
32411,THE EXEQUY,Through which to thee I swiftly glide.
32412,THE EXEQUY,"'Tis true, with shame and grief I yield,"
32413,THE EXEQUY,"Thou, like the van, first took'st the field;"
32414,THE EXEQUY,And gotten hast the victory
32415,THE EXEQUY,In thus adventuring to die
32416,THE EXEQUY,"Before me, whose more years might crave"
32417,THE EXEQUY,A just precedence in the grave.
32418,THE EXEQUY,"But hark! my pulse, like a soft drum,"

32420,THE EXEQUY,And slow howe'er my marches be
32421,THE EXEQUY,I shall at last sit down by thee.
32422,THE EXEQUY,
32423,THE EXEQUY,The thought of this bids me go on

32425,THE EXEQUY,With hope and comfort.  Dear (forgive

33790,I,"That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,"
33791,I,The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
33792,I,"Were called into her with a sharp surprise,"
33793,I,"And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,"
33794,I,Dreadfully venomous to him.  She lay
33795,I,"Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away"
33796,I,With muffled pulses.  Then as midnight makes
33797,I,Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
33798,I,"Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat"
33799,I,"Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet"
33800,I,"Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,"
33801,I,By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.
33802,I,Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
33803,I,"Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;"
33804,I,Each wishing for the sword that severs all.

33807,II,"It ended, and the morrow brought the task."
33808,II,"Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in"

33810,II,"Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask."
33811,II,"But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!"
33812,II,He sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:
33813,II,"A languid humor stole among the hours,"
33814,II,"And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,"
33815,II,"And raged deep inward, till the light was brown"
33816,II,"Before his vision, and the world forgot,"
33817,II,Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.
33818,II,"A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown"
33819,II,The pit of infamy: and then again
33820,II,"He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove"
33821,II,"To ape the magnanimity of love,"

33828,III,"Or, being callous, haply till he can."
33829,III,But he is nothing: - nothing?  Only mark

33834,III,"See that I am drawn to her, even now!"
33835,III,It cannot be such harm on her cool brow
33836,III,To plant a kiss?  Yet if I meet him there!
33837,III,"But she is mine!  Ah, no! I know too well"
33838,III,I claim a star whose light is overcast:

33847,XIV,"It seems there is another veering fit,"
33848,XIV,"Since on a gold-haired lady's eyeballs pure,"
33849,XIV,"I looked with little prospect of a cure,"
33850,XIV,The while her mouth's red bow loosed shafts of wit.
33851,XIV,Just heaven! can it be true that jealousy
33852,XIV,Has decked the woman thus? and does her head
33853,XIV,Swim somewhat for possessions forfeited?
33854,XIV,"Madam, you teach me many things that be."
33855,XIV,"I open an old book, and there I find,"

33861,XVI,In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour
33862,XVI,"When in the firelight steadily aglow,"
33863,XVI,"Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow"
33864,XVI,Among the clicking coals.  Our library-bower
33865,XVI,That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
33866,XVI,As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
33867,XVI,From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
33868,XVI,The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
33869,XVI,Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay
33870,XVI,"With us, and of it was our talk.  ""Ah, yes!"
33871,XVI,"Love dies!"" I said: I never thought it less."
33872,XVI,She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.
33873,XVI,"Then when the fire domed blackening, I found"
33874,XVI,"Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift"
33875,XVI,Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift: -
33876,XVI,Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!

33879,XXVI,"Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,"
33880,XXVI,Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve
33881,XXVI,He views the rosy dawn.  In vain they weave
33882,XXVI,The fatal web below while far he flies.
33883,XXVI,"But when the arrow strikes him, there's a change."
33884,XXVI,"He moves but in the track of his spent pain,"
33885,XXVI,"Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,"
33886,XXVI,"Binding him to the ground, with narrow range."
33887,XXVI,A subtle serpent then has Love become.
33888,XXVI,I had the eagle in my bosom erst:
33889,XXVI,Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.
33890,XXVI,I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.
33891,XXVI,"Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth."
33892,XXVI,Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:

33939,XLIX,"She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,"

34163,II,"Trembles along the dusk, till peal on peal"
34164,II,"It pierces every living heart that hears,"
34165,II,Pierces and burns and purifies like fire;
34166,II,"Again I kneel under the starry spheres,"
34167,II,"And all my soul seems healed, and lifted higher,"
34168,II,Nor could that jubilant song of day prevail
34169,II,"Like thine of tender grief, O nightingale."
34170,II,
34171,III,III
34172,III,"Bow down, my song, before her presence high,"
34173,III,In that far world where you must seek her now;
34174,III,"Say that you bring to her no sonnetry,"
34175,III,But plain-set anguish of the breast or brow;
34176,III,"Say that on earth I sang to her alone,"
34177,III,"But now, while in her heaven she sits divine,"
34178,III,"Turning, I tell the world my bitter moan,"
34179,III,"Bidding it share its hopes and griefs with mine,"
34180,III,"Versing not what I would, but what I must,"
34181,III,"Wail of the wind, or sobbing of the wave;"
34182,III,"Ah! say you raised my bowed head from the dust,"
34183,III,And held me backward from a willful grave;
34184,III,"Say this, and her sweet pity will approve,"
34185,III,And bind yet closer her dead bond of love.
34186,III,
34187,VII,VII
34188,VII,I watch beside you in your silent room;
34189,VII,"Without, the chill rain falls, life dies away,"
34190,VII,"The dead leaves drip, and the fast-gathering gloom"
34191,VII,"Closes around this brief November day,"
34192,VII,"First day of holy death, of sacred rest;"
34193,VII,"I kiss your brow, calm, beautiful and cold,"
34194,VII,"I lay my yearning arms across your breast,"
34195,VII,I claim our darling rapture as of old;
34196,VII,"Dear heart, I linger but a little space,"
34197,VII,"Sweet wife, I come to your new world ere long;"
34198,VII,"This lily - keep it till our next embrace,"
34199,VII,"While the mute Angel makes our love more strong,"
34200,VII,"While here I cling, in life's short agony,"
34201,VII,"To God, and to your deathless memory."
34202,VII,
34203,XVI,XVI
34204,XVI,Comes the New Year; wailing the north winds blow;
34205,XVI,"In her cold, lonely grave my dead love lies;"
34206,XVI,"Dead lies the stiffened earth beneath the snow,"
34207,XVI,And blinding sleet blots out the desolate skies;
34208,XVI,I stand between the living and the dead;
34209,XVI,"Hateful to me is life, hateful is death;"
34210,XVI,"Her life was sad, and on that narrow bed"
34211,XVI,"She will not turn, nor wake with human breath."
34212,XVI,I kneel between the evil and the good;
34213,XVI,"The struggle o'er, this one sweet faith have I -"
34214,XVI,"Though life and death be dimly understood,"
34215,XVI,She loved me; I loved her; love cannot die;
34216,XVI,"Go then thy way with thine accustomed cheer,"
34217,XVI,"Nor heed my churlish greeting, O New Year."

34220,XXIII,"Like some lone miser, dear, behold me stand,"

34222,XXIII,A last word penciled by that poor left hand;
34223,XXIII,"Two kindred names on the same gentle scroll,"
34224,XXIII,"(I found it near your pillow,) traced below;"
34225,XXIII,"This little scarf you made, our latest pride;"
34226,XXIII,"The violet I digged so long ago,"
34227,XXIII,That nestled in your bosom till you died;
34228,XXIII,"But dearest to my heart, whereon it lies,"
34229,XXIII,"Is one warm tress of your luxuriant hair,"
34230,XXIII,"Still present to my touch, my lips, my eyes,"
34231,XXIII,"Forever changeless, and forever fair,"
34232,XXIII,"And even in your grave, beauteous and free"
34233,XXIII,From the cold grasp of mutability.

34236,XXXVI,So sang I in the springtime of my years -
34237,XXXVI,"""There's nothing we can call our own but love;"""
34238,XXXVI,"So let me murmur now that winter nears,"
34239,XXXVI,And even in death the deathless truth approve.
34240,XXXVI,"Oft have I seen the slow, the broadening river"
34241,XXXVI,Roll its glad waters to the parent sea;
34242,XXXVI,Death is the call of love to love; the giver
34243,XXXVI,Claims his own gift for some new mystery.
34244,XXXVI,"In boundless love divine the heavens are spread,"
34245,XXXVI,"In wedded love is earth's divinest store,"
34246,XXXVI,"And he that liveth to himself is dead,"
34247,XXXVI,And he that lives for love lives evermore;
34248,XXXVI,Only in love can life's true path be trod;
34249,XXXVI,Love is self-giving; therefore love is God.
34250,XXXVI,
34251,XXXVII,XXXVII
34252,XXXVII,"Hear, O Self-Giver, infinite as good;"
34253,XXXVII,"This faith, at least, my wavering heart should hold,"
34254,XXXVII,"Nor find in dark regret its daily food,"
34255,XXXVII,But catch the gleam of glories yet untold.
34256,XXXVII,"Yea, even on earth, beloved, as love well knew,"
34257,XXXVII,"Brief absence brought our fond returning kiss,"
34258,XXXVII,So let my soul to God's great world and you
34259,XXXVII,Look onward with sweet pain of secret bliss; -
34260,XXXVII,"O sunset sky and lonely gleaming star,"
34261,XXXVII,"Your beauty thrills me from the bound of space,"
34262,XXXVII,"O Love, thy loveliness shows best afar,"
34263,XXXVII,And only Heaven shall give thee perfect grace;
34264,XXXVII,"Grant then, dear Lord, that all who love may be"

34269,XLV,"'Tis vain that I have given thee vows and tears,"
34270,XLV,"Or striven in verse my tenderness to prove,"
34271,XLV,Or held thy hand in journeyings through the years;

34274,XLV,"""Only for thee I would the strain were sweet,"
34275,XLV,"Only for thee I would the words were strong;"""
34276,XLV,"Vain even that I closed with death, and fought"
34277,XLV,"To hold thee longer in a world so dear,"
34278,XLV,"Vain that I count a weary world as naught,"
34279,XLV,That I would die to bring thee back; I hear

34290,I,I thought once how Theocritus had sung

34292,I,Who each one in a gracious hand appears
34293,I,"To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:"
34294,I,"And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,"
34295,I,"I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,"
34296,I,"The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,"
34297,I,"Those of my own life, who by turns had flung"
34298,I,"A shadow across me.  Straightway I was 'ware,"
34299,I,"So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move"
34300,I,"Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;"
34301,I,"And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, -"
34302,I,"Guess now who holds thee?"" - ""Death,"" I said.  But, there,"
34303,I,"The silver answer rang, - ""Not Death, but Love."""

34305,III,III
34306,III,"Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!"
34307,III,Unlike our uses and our destinies.
34308,III,Our ministering two angels look surprise
34309,III,"On one another, as they strike athwart"
34310,III,"Their wings in passing.  Thou, bethink thee, art"
34311,III,"A guest for queens to social pageantries,"
34312,III,With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
34313,III,"Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part"
34314,III,Of chief musician.  What hast thou to do
34315,III,"With looking from the lattice-lights at me,"
34316,III,"A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through"
34317,III,"The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?"
34318,III,"The chrism is on thine head, - on mine, the dew, -"
34319,III,And Death must dig the level where these agree.

34321,VI,VI
34322,VI,Go from me.  Yet I feel that I shall stand
34323,VI,Henceforward in thy shadow.  Nevermore
34324,VI,Alone upon the threshold of my door
34325,VI,"Of individual life, I shall command"
34326,VI,"The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand"
34327,VI,"Serenely in the sunshine as before,"
34328,VI,"Without the sense of that which I forbore, -"
34329,VI,Thy touch upon the palm.  The widest land
34330,VI,"Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine"
34331,VI,With pulses that beat double.  What I do
34332,VI,"And what I dream include thee, as the wine"
34333,VI,Must taste of its own grapes.  And when I sue
34334,VI,"God for myself, He hears that name of thine,"
34335,VI,And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
34336,VI,
34337,VII,VII
34338,VII,"The face of all the world is changed, I think,"
34339,VII,Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
34340,VII,"Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole"
34341,VII,Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
34342,VII,"Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,"
34343,VII,"Was caught up into love, and taught the whole"
34344,VII,Of life in a new rhythm.  The cup of dole
34345,VII,"God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,"
34346,VII,"And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear."
34347,VII,"The name of country, heaven, are changed away"
34348,VII,"For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;"
34349,VII,"And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,"
34350,VII,"(The singing angels know) are only dear,"
34351,VII,Because thy name moves right in what they say.

34360,VIII,"Ungrateful, that for these most manifold"
34361,VIII,"High gifts, I render nothing back at all?"
34362,VIII,"Not so; not cold, - but very poor instead."
34363,VIII,Ask God who knows.  For frequent tears have run
34364,VIII,"The colors from my life, and left so dead"
34365,VIII,"And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done"
34366,VIII,To give the same as pillow to thy head.
34367,VIII,Go farther! let it serve to trample on.
34368,VIII,
34369,IX,IX
34370,IX,Can it be right to give what I can give?
34371,IX,To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
34372,IX,"As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years"
34373,IX,Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
34374,IX,Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
34375,IX,"For all thy adjurations?  O my fears,"
34376,IX,That this can scarce be right!  We are not peers
34377,IX,"So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,"
34378,IX,"That givers of such gifts as mine are, must"
34379,IX,"Be counted with the ungenerous.  Out, alas!"
34380,IX,"I will not soil thy purple with my dust,"
34381,IX,"Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,"
34382,IX,Nor give thee any love - which were unjust.

34385,X,X
34386,X,"Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed"

34389,X,Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
34390,X,And love is fire.  And when I say at need
34391,X,I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee - in thy sight
34392,X,"I stand transfigured, glorified aright,"
34393,X,With conscience of the new rays that proceed
34394,X,Out of my face toward thine.  There's nothing low
34395,X,"In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures"
34396,X,"Who love God, God accepts while loving so."
34397,X,"And what I feel, across the inferior features"

34405,XII,"To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost, -"
34406,XII,"This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,"
34407,XII,"I should not love withal, unless that thou"
34408,XII,"Hadst set me an example, shown me how,"
34409,XII,"When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,"

34424,XIV,"For these things in themselves, Beloved, may"
34425,XIV,"Be changed, or change for thee, - and love, so wrought,"
34426,XIV,May be unwrought so.  Neither love me for
34427,XIV,"Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry, -"
34428,XIV,"A creature might forget to weep, who bore"
34429,XIV,"Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!"

34437,XVII,Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
34438,XVII,In a serene air purely.  Antidotes
34439,XVII,"Of medicated music, answering for"
34440,XVII,"Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour"
34441,XVII,From thence into their ears.  God's will devotes
34442,XVII,"Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine."
34443,XVII,"How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?"
34444,XVII,"A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine"
34445,XVII,"Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?"
34446,XVII,"A shade, in which to sing - of palm or pine?"

34456,XVIII,"Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,"
34457,XVIII,"As girls do, any more: it only may"
34458,XVIII,"Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,"
34459,XVIII,Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
34460,XVIII,Through sorrow's trick.  I thought the funeral-shears
34461,XVIII,"Would take this first, but Love is justified, -"
34462,XVIII,"Take it thou, - finding pure, from all those years,"
34463,XVIII,The kiss my mother left here when she died.

34523,XXXVIII,"That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,"
34524,XXXVIII,"With sanctifying sweetness, did precede."
34525,XXXVIII,The third upon my lips was folded down
