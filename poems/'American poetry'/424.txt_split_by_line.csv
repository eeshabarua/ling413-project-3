135,I,I
136,I,
137,I,[Bass drum beaten loudly.]
138,I,Booth led boldly with his big bass drum--
139,I,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
140,I,"The Saints smiled gravely and they said:  ""He's come."""
141,I,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
142,I,"Walking lepers followed, rank on rank,"
143,I,"Lurching bravoes from the ditches dank,"
144,I,Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale--
145,I,"Minds still passion-ridden, soul-powers frail:--"
146,I,"Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath,"
147,I,Unwashed legions with the ways of Death--
148,I,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
149,I,
150,I,[Banjos.]
151,I,Every slum had sent its half-a-score
152,I,The round world over.  (Booth had groaned for more.)
153,I,Every banner that the wide world flies
154,I,Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes.
155,I,"Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang,"
156,I,"Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:--"
157,I,"""Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"""
158,I,Hallelujah!  It was queer to see
159,I,Bull-necked convicts with that land make free.
160,I,"Loons with trumpets blowed a blare, blare, blare"
161,I,"On, on upward thro' the golden air!"
162,I,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
163,I,
164,I,
165,II,II
166,II,
167,II,[Bass drum slower and softer.]
168,II,"Booth died blind and still by Faith he trod,"
169,II,Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God.
170,II,"Booth led boldly, and he looked the chief"
171,II,"Eagle countenance in sharp relief,"
172,II,"Beard a-flying, air of high command"
173,II,Unabated in that holy land.
174,II,
175,II,[Sweet flute music.]
176,II,"Jesus came from out the court-house door,"
177,II,Stretched his hands above the passing poor.
178,II,"Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there"
179,II,Round and round the mighty court-house square.
180,II,Yet in an instant all that blear review
181,II,"Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new."
182,II,"The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled"
183,II,"And blind eyes opened on a new, sweet world."
184,II,
185,II,[Bass drum louder.]
186,II,Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole!
187,II,"Gone was the weasel-head, the snout, the jowl!"
188,II,"Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean,"
189,II,"Rulers of empires, and of forests green!"
190,II,
191,II,[Grand chorus of all instruments.  Tambourines to the foreground.]
192,II,"The hosts were sandalled, and their wings were fire!"
193,II,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
194,II,But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir.
195,II,(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)
196,II,"O, shout Salvation!  It was good to see"
197,II,Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free.
198,II,The banjos rattled and the tambourines
199,II,Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens.
200,II,
201,II,"[Reverently sung, no instruments.]"
202,II,And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer
203,II,He saw his Master thro' the flag-filled air.
204,II,Christ came gently with a robe and crown
205,II,"For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down."
206,II,"He saw King Jesus.  They were face to face,"
207,II,And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.
208,II,Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
209,II,
210,II,
211,II,
212,II,
213,II,The Drunkards in the Street
214,II,
215,II,
216,II,"The Drunkards in the street are calling one another,"
217,II,"Heeding not the night-wind, great of heart and gay,--"
218,II,Publicans and wantons--
219,II,"Calling, laughing, calling,"
220,II,While the Spirit bloweth Space and Time away.
221,II,
222,II,"Why should I feel the sobbing, the secrecy, the glory,"
223,II,"This comforter, this fitful wind divine?"
224,II,"I the cautious Pharisee, the scribe, the whited sepulchre--"
225,II,"I have no right to God, he is not mine."
226,II,
227,II,*    *    *    *    *
228,II,
229,II,"Within their gutters, drunkards dream of Hell."
230,II,"I say my prayers by my white bed to-night,"
231,II,"With the arms of God about me, with the angels singing, singing"
232,II,Until the grayness of my soul grows white.
233,II,
234,II,
235,II,
236,II,
237,II,The City That Will Not Repent
238,II,
239,II,
240,II,Climbing the heights of Berkeley
241,II,Nightly I watch the West.
242,II,"There lies new San Francisco,"
243,II,"Sea-maid in purple dressed,"
244,II,Wearing a dancer's girdle
245,II,All to inflame desire:
246,II,"Scorning her days of sackcloth,"
247,II,Scorning her cleansing fire.
248,II,
249,II,"See, like a burning city"
250,II,Sets now the red sun's dome.
251,II,"See, mystic firebrands sparkle"
252,II,There on each store and home.
253,II,See how the golden gateway
254,II,Burns with the day to be--
255,II,Torch-bearing fiends of portent
256,II,Loom o'er the earth and sea.
257,II,
258,II,Not by the earthquake daunted
259,II,"Nor by new fears made tame,"
260,II,Painting her face and laughing
261,II,Plays she a new-found game.
262,II,Here on her half-cool cinders
263,II,"'Frisco abides in mirth,"
264,II,Planning the wildest splendor
265,II,Ever upon the earth.
266,II,
267,II,Here on this crumbling rock-ledge
268,II,"'Frisco her all will stake,"
269,II,"Blowing her bubble-towers,"
270,II,"Swearing they will not break,"
271,II,"Rearing her Fair transcendent,"
272,II,"Singing with piercing art,"
273,II,"Calling to Ancient Asia,"
274,II,Wooing young Europe's heart.
275,II,Here where her God has scourged her
276,II,"Wantoning, singing sweet:"
277,II,Waiting her mad bad lovers
278,II,Here by the judgment-seat!
279,II,
280,II,"'Frisco, God's doughty foeman,"
281,II,Scorns and blasphemes him strong.
282,II,Tho' he again should smite her
283,II,She would not slack her song.
284,II,"Nay, she would shriek and rally--"
285,II,'Frisco would ten times rise!
286,II,"Not till her last tower crumbles,"
287,II,"Not till her last rose dies,"
288,II,"Not till the coast sinks seaward,"
289,II,Not till the cold tides beat
290,II,"Over the high white Shasta,"
291,II,'Frisco will cry defeat.
292,II,
293,II,"God loves this rebel city,"
294,II,"Loves foemen brisk and game,"
295,II,"Tho', just to please the angels,"
296,II,He may send down his flame.
297,II,God loves the golden leopard
298,II,Tho' he may spoil her lair.
299,II,"God smites, yet loves the lion."
300,II,God makes the panther fair.
301,II,
302,II,"Dance then, wild guests of 'Frisco,"
303,II,"Yellow, bronze, white and red!"
304,II,Dance by the golden gateway--
305,II,"Dance, tho' he smite you dead!"
306,II,
307,II,
308,II,
309,II,
310,II,The Trap
311,II,
312,II,
313,II,"She was taught desire in the street,"
314,II,Not at the angels' feet.
315,II,By the good no word was said
316,II,Of the worth of the bridal bed.
317,II,"The secret was learned from the vile,"
318,II,Not from her mother's smile.
319,II,Home spoke not.  And the girl
320,II,Was caught in the public whirl.
321,II,"Do you say ""She gave consent:"
322,II,"Life drunk, she was content"
323,II,"With beasts that her fire could please?"""
324,II,But she did not choose disease
325,II,Of mind and nerves and breath.
326,II,"She was trapped to a slow, foul death."
327,II,"The door was watched so well,"
328,II,That the steep dark stair to hell
329,II,Was the only escaping way . . .
330,II,"""She gave consent,"" you say?"
331,II,
332,II,"Some think she was meek and good,"
333,II,Only lost in the wood
334,II,"Of youth, and deceived in man"
335,II,When the hunger of sex began
336,II,That ties the husband and wife
337,II,To the end in a strong fond life.
338,II,"Her captor, by chance was one"
339,II,"Of those whose passion was done,"
340,II,A cold fierce worm of the sea
341,II,Enslaving for you and me.
342,II,The wages the poor must take
343,II,Have forced them to serve this snake.
344,II,"Yea, half-paid girls must go"
345,II,For bread to his pit below.
346,II,What hangman shall wait his host
347,II,"Of butchers from coast to coast,"
348,II,New York to the Golden Gate--
349,II,"The merger of death and fate,"
350,II,Lust-kings with a careful plan
351,II,"Clean-cut, American?"
352,II,
353,II,In liberty's name we cry
354,II,For these women about to die.
355,II,
356,II,O mothers who failed to tell
357,II,"The mazes of heaven and hell,"
358,II,"Who failed to advise, implore"
359,II,"Your daughters at Love's strange door,"
360,II,What will you do this day?
361,II,"Your dear ones are hidden away,"
362,II,"As good as chained to the bed,"
363,II,"Hid like the mad, or the dead:--"
364,II,The glories of endless years
365,II,Drowned in their harlot-tears:
366,II,"The children they hoped to bear,"
367,II,"Grandchildren strong and fair,"
368,II,"The life for ages to be,"
369,II,"Cut off like a blasted tree,"
370,II,"Murdered in filth in a day,"
371,II,"Somehow, by the merchant gay!"
372,II,
373,II,In liberty's name we cry
374,II,For these women about to die.
375,II,
376,II,What shall be said of a state
377,II,Where traps for the white brides wait?
378,II,Of sellers of drink who play
379,II,The game for the extra pay?
380,II,Of statesmen in league with all
381,II,Who hope for the girl-child's fall?
382,II,Of banks where hell's money is paid
383,II,And Pharisees all afraid
384,II,Of pandars that help them sin?
385,II,When will our wrath begin?
386,II,
387,II,
388,II,
389,II,
390,II,"Where is David, the Next King of Israel?"
391,II,
392,II,
393,II,"Where is David? . . .  O God's people,"
394,II,"Saul has passed, the good and great."
395,II,Mourn for Saul the first-anointed--
396,II,Head and shoulders o'er the state.
397,II,
398,II,He was found among the Prophets:
399,II,"Judge and monarch, merged in one."
400,II,But the wars of Saul are ended
401,II,And the works of Saul are done.
402,II,
403,II,"Where is David, ruddy shepherd,"
404,II,God's boy-king for Israel?
405,II,"Mystic, ardent, dowered with beauty,"
406,II,Singing where still waters dwell?
407,II,
408,II,"Prophet, find that destined minstrel"
409,II,"Wandering on the range to-day,"
410,II,Driving sheep and crooning softly
411,II,Psalms that cannot pass away.
412,II,
413,II,"""David waits,"" the prophet answers,"
414,II,"""In a black notorious den,"
415,II,In a cave upon the border
416,II,With four hundred outlaw men.
417,II,
418,II,"""He is fair, and loved of women,"
419,II,"Mighty-hearted, born to sing:"
420,II,"Thieving, weeping, erring, praying,"
421,II,Radiant royal rebel-king.
422,II,
423,II,"""He will come with harp and psaltry,"
424,II,"Quell his troop of convict swine,"
425,II,"Quell his mad-dog roaring rascals,"
426,II,Witching them with words divine--
427,II,
428,II,"""They will ram the walls of Zion!"
429,II,"They will win us Salem hill,"
430,II,"All for David, Shepherd David--"
431,II,"Singing like a mountain rill!"""
432,II,
433,II,
434,II,
435,II,
436,II,On Reading Omar Khayyam
437,II,
438,II,"[During an anti-saloon campaign, in central Illinois.]"
439,II,
440,II,
441,II,"In the midst of the battle I turned,"
442,II,(For the thunders could flourish without me)
443,II,"And hid by a rose-hung wall,"
444,II,Forgetting the murder about me;
445,II,"And wrote, from my wound, on the stone,"
446,II,"In mirth, half prayer, half play:--"
447,II,"""Send me a picture book,"
448,II,"Send me a song, to-day."""
449,II,
450,II,I saw him there by the wall
451,II,"When I scarce had written the line,"
452,II,In the enemy's colors dressed
453,II,And the serpent-standard of wine
454,II,Writhing its withered length
455,II,"From his ghostly hands o'er the ground,"
456,II,And there by his shadowy breast
457,II,The glorious poem I found.
458,II,
459,II,This was his world-old cry:
460,II,Thus read the famous prayer:
461,II,"""Wine, wine, wine and flowers"
462,II,"And cup-bearers always fair!"""
463,II,'Twas a book of the snares of earth
464,II,"Bordered in gold and blue,"
465,II,And I read each line to the wind
466,II,And read to the roses too:
467,II,And they nodded their womanly heads
468,II,And told to the wall just why
469,II,"For wine of the earth men bleed,"
470,II,Kingdoms and empires die.
471,II,I envied the grape stained sage:
472,II,(The roses were praising him.)
473,II,The ways of the world seemed good
474,II,And the glory of heaven dim.
475,II,I envied the endless kings
476,II,"Who found great pearls in the mire,"
477,II,Who bought with the nation's life
478,II,The cup of delicious fire.
479,II,
480,II,"But the wine of God came down,"
481,II,And I drank it out of the air.
482,II,"(Fair is the serpent-cup,"
483,II,But the cup of God more fair.)
484,II,The wine of God came down
485,II,That makes no drinker to weep.
486,II,And I went back to battle again
487,II,Leaving the singer asleep.
488,II,
489,II,
490,II,
491,II,
492,II,The Beggar's Valentine
493,II,
494,II,
495,II,Kiss me and comfort my heart
496,II,Maiden honest and fine.
497,II,I am the pilgrim boy
498,II,"Lame, but hunting the shrine;"
499,II,
500,II,"Fleeing away from the sweets,"
501,II,"Seeking the dust and rain,"
502,II,"Sworn to the staff and road,"
503,II,Scorning pleasure and pain;
504,II,
505,II,Nevertheless my mouth
506,II,Would rest like a bird an hour
507,II,And find in your curls a nest
508,II,And find in your breast a bower:
509,II,
510,II,Nevertheless my eyes
511,II,"Would lose themselves in your own,"
512,II,"Rivers that seek the sea,"
513,II,Angels before the throne:
514,II,
515,II,"Kiss me and comfort my heart,"
516,II,For love can never be mine:
517,II,"Passion, hunger and pain,"
518,II,These are the only wine
519,II,
520,II,Of the pilgrim bound to the road.
521,II,He would rob no man of his own.
522,II,"Your heart is another's I know,"
523,II,Your honor is his alone.
524,II,
525,II,"The feasts of a long drawn love,"
526,II,"The feasts of a wedded life,"
527,II,"The harvests of patient years,"
528,II,And hearthstone and children and wife:
529,II,
530,II,These are your lords I know.
531,II,These can never be mine--
532,II,This is the price I pay
533,II,For the foolish search for the shrine:
534,II,
535,II,This is the price I pay
536,II,"For the joy of my midnight prayers,"
537,II,Kneeling beneath the moon
538,II,With hills for my altar stairs;
539,II,
540,II,This is the price I pay
541,II,"For the throb of the mystic wings,"
542,II,When the dove of God comes down
543,II,And beats round my heart and sings;
544,II,
545,II,This is the price I pay
546,II,For the light I shall some day see
547,II,At the ends of the infinite earth
548,II,When truth shall come to me.
549,II,
550,II,And what if my body die
551,II,Before I meet the truth?
552,II,"The road is dear, more dear"
553,II,Than love or life or youth.
554,II,
555,II,"The road, it is the road,"
556,II,"Mystical, endless, kind,"
557,II,"Mother of visions vast,"
558,II,Mother of soul and mind;
559,II,
560,II,Mother of all of me
561,II,But the blood that cries for a mate--
562,II,That cries for a farewell kiss
563,II,From the child of God at the gate.
564,II,
565,II,
566,II,
567,II,
568,II,Honor Among Scamps
569,II,
570,II,
