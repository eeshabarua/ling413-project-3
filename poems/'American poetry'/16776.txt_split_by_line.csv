92,PREFACE,PREFACE
93,PREFACE,
94,PREFACE,Among the twelve hundred poems which have emanated from my too prolific
95,PREFACE,pen there are some forty or fifty which treat entirely of that emotion
96,PREFACE,"which has been denominated ""the grand passion""--love. A few of those are"
97,PREFACE,of an extremely fiery character.
98,PREFACE,
99,PREFACE,"When I issued my collection known as ""Maurine, and Other Poems,"" I"
100,PREFACE,purposely omitted all save two or three of these. I had been frequently
101,PREFACE,accused of writing only sentimental verses; and I took pleasure and
102,PREFACE,pride in presenting to the public a volume which contained more than one
103,PREFACE,hundred poems upon other than sentimental topics. But no sooner was the
104,PREFACE,book published than letters of regret came to me from friends and
105,PREFACE,"strangers, and from all quarters of the globe, asking why this or that"
106,PREFACE,love poem had been omitted. These regrets were repeated to me by so many
107,PREFACE,people that I decided to collect and issue these poems in a small volume
108,PREFACE,"to be called ""Poems of Passion."" By the word ""Passion"" I meant the"
109,PREFACE,"""grand passion"" of love. To those who take exception to the title of the"
110,PREFACE,book I would suggest an early reference to Webster's definitions of the
111,PREFACE,word.
112,PREFACE,
113,PREFACE,Since this volume has caused so much agitation throughout the entire
114,PREFACE,"country, and even sent a tremor across the Atlantic into the Old World,"
115,PREFACE,I beg leave to make a few statements concerning some of the poems.
116,PREFACE,
117,PREFACE,The excitement of mingled horror and amaze seems to center upon four
118,PREFACE,"poems, namely: ""Delilah,"" ""Ad Finem,"" ""Conversion,"" and ""Communism."""
119,PREFACE,
120,PREFACE,"""Delilah"" was written and first published in 1877. I had been reading"
121,PREFACE,"history, and became stirred by the power of such women as Aspasia and"
122,PREFACE,"Cleopatra over such grand men as Antony, Socrates, and Pericles. Under"
123,PREFACE,"the influence of this feeling I dashed off ""Delilah,"" which I meant to"
124,PREFACE,be an expression of the powerful fascination of such a woman upon the
125,PREFACE,"memory of a man, even as he neared the hour of death. If the poem is"
126,PREFACE,"immoral, then the history which inspired it is immoral. I consider it my"
127,PREFACE,finest effort.
128,PREFACE,
129,PREFACE,"""Ad Finem"" was written in 1878. I think there are few women of strong"
130,PREFACE,"character and affections who cannot, from either experience or"
131,PREFACE,"observation, understand the violent intensity of regret and despair"
132,PREFACE,which sometimes takes possession of the human heart after the loss by
133,PREFACE,"death, fate, or the force of circumstances, of some one very dear."
134,PREFACE,
135,PREFACE,"In ""Ad Finem"" I intended to give voice to this very common experience of"
136,PREFACE,almost every heart. Many noble women have since told me that the poem
137,PREFACE,"was true to life. It is not, as many people have wilfully or stupidly"
138,PREFACE,"construed it, a bit of poetical advice to womankind to ""barter the joys"
139,PREFACE,"of Paradise"" for ""just one kiss."" It is simply an illustration of a"
140,PREFACE,"moment of turbulent anguish and vehement despair, such moments of"
141,PREFACE,unreasoning and overwhelming sorrow as the most moral people may
142,PREFACE,experience during a lifetime.
143,PREFACE,
144,PREFACE,"In ""Communism"" I endeavored to use a new simile in illustrating that"
145,PREFACE,somewhat hackneyed theme of the supremacy of Love over Reason; and
146,PREFACE,simply to carry out my idea I represented the violent uprising of the
147,PREFACE,Communist emotions against King Reason.
148,PREFACE,
149,PREFACE,"""Conversion"" was suggested to me by the remark of a gentleman friend. In"
150,PREFACE,"speaking to me of the woman he loved, he said: ""I have always been a"
151,PREFACE,"skeptic regarding the existence of heaven, but I am so much happier in"
152,PREFACE,my love for this woman than I ever supposed it possible for me to be on
153,PREFACE,earth that I begin to believe that the tales of heavenly raptures may be
154,PREFACE,"true."""
155,PREFACE,
156,PREFACE,"I embodied his idea in the poem which has brought, with a few others, so"
157,PREFACE,"much censure and criticism upon this volume, although it contains nearly"
158,PREFACE,"seventy-five other selections quite irreproachable in character, however"
159,PREFACE,faulty they may be in construction.
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,It is impossible to pursue a successful literary career and follow the
162,PREFACE,"advice of all one's ""best friends."" I have received severe censure from"
163,PREFACE,my orthodox friends for writing liberal verses. My liberal friends
164,PREFACE,"condemn my devout and religious poems as ""aiding superstition."" My early"
165,PREFACE,"temperance verses were pronounced ""fanatical trash"" by others."
166,PREFACE,
167,PREFACE,With all due thanks and appreciation for the kind motives which interest
168,PREFACE,"so many dear friends in my career, I yet feel compelled to follow the"
169,PREFACE,"light which my own intellect and judgment cast upon my way, rather than"
170,PREFACE,any one of the many conflicting rays which other minds would lend me.

561,INDIVIDUALITY.,You cannot grasp it. Seize the breath of morn

563,INDIVIDUALITY.,God put it in my soul when I was born;
564,INDIVIDUALITY.,"It is not mine to give away, or sell,"

3035,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,
3036,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"And I wonder oft as I lie awake,"
3037,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,And list to the river that seethes and surges
3038,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,Over the wheel that it chides and urges--
3039,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,I wonder oft if that wheel will break
3040,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"With the mighty pressure it bears, some day,"
3041,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,Or slowly and wearily wear away.
3042,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,
3043,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"For little by little the heart is wearing,"
3044,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"Like the wheel of the mill, as the tide goes tearing"
3045,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"And plunging hurriedly through my breast,"
3046,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"In a network of veins on a nameless quest,"
3047,THE WHEEL OF THE BREAST.,"From and forth, unto unknown oceans,"

3054,A MEETING.,A MEETING.
3055,A MEETING.,
3056,A MEETING.,Quite carelessly I turned the newsy sheet;
3057,A MEETING.,"A song I sang, full many a year ago,"
3058,A MEETING.,"Smiled up at me, as in a busy street"
3059,A MEETING.,One meets an old-time friend he used to know.
3060,A MEETING.,
3061,A MEETING.,"So full it was, that simple little song,"
3062,A MEETING.,"Of all the hope, the transport, and the truth,"
3063,A MEETING.,"Which to the impetuous morn of life belong,"
3064,A MEETING.,That once again I seemed to grasp my youth.
3065,A MEETING.,
3066,A MEETING.,"So full it was of that sweet, fancied pain"
3067,A MEETING.,"We woo and cherish ere we meet with woe,"
3068,A MEETING.,I felt as one who hears a plaintive strain
3069,A MEETING.,His mother sang him in the long ago.
3070,A MEETING.,
3071,A MEETING.,Up from the grave the years that lay between
3072,A MEETING.,That song's birthday and my stern present came
3073,A MEETING.,"Like phantom forms and swept across the scene,"
3074,A MEETING.,Bearing their broken dreams of love and fame.
3075,A MEETING.,
3076,A MEETING.,Fair hopes and bright ambitions that I knew
3077,A MEETING.,"In that old time, with their ideal grace,"
3078,A MEETING.,"Shone for a moment, then were lost to view"
3079,A MEETING.,Behind the dull clouds of the commonplace.
3080,A MEETING.,
3081,A MEETING.,With trembling hands I put the sheet away;
3082,A MEETING.,"Ah, little song! the sad and bitter truth"
3083,A MEETING.,Struck like an arrow when we met that day!
3084,A MEETING.,My life has missed the promise of its youth.

3091,EARNESTNESS.,The hurry of the times affects us so
3092,EARNESTNESS.,"In this swift rushing hour, we crowd and press"
3093,EARNESTNESS.,"And thrust each other backward as we go,"
3094,EARNESTNESS.,And do not pause to lay sufficient stress
3095,EARNESTNESS.,"Upon that good, strong, true word, Earnestness."
3096,EARNESTNESS.,"In our impetuous haste, could we but know"
3097,EARNESTNESS.,"Its full, deep meaning, its vast import, oh,"
3098,EARNESTNESS.,Then might we grasp the secret of success!
3099,EARNESTNESS.,"In that receding age when men were great,"
3100,EARNESTNESS.,The bone and sinew of their purpose lay
3101,EARNESTNESS.,In this one word. God likes an earnest soul--
3102,EARNESTNESS.,Too earnest to be eager. Soon or late
3103,EARNESTNESS.,"It leaves the spent horde breathless by the way,"
3104,EARNESTNESS.,"And stands serene, triumphant at the goal."

3111,A PICTURE.,I strolled last eve across the lonely down;
3112,A PICTURE.,One solitary picture struck my eye:
3113,A PICTURE.,A distant ploughboy stood against the sky--
3114,A PICTURE.,How far he seemed above the noisy town!
3115,A PICTURE.,
3116,A PICTURE.,Upon the bosom of a cloud the sod
3117,A PICTURE.,"Laid its bruised cheek as he moved slowly by,"
3118,A PICTURE.,"And, watching him, I asked myself if I"
3119,A PICTURE.,In very truth stood half as near to God.

3128,TWIN-BORN.,"He who possesses virtue at its best,"
3129,TWIN-BORN.,"Or greatness in the true sense of the word,"
3130,TWIN-BORN.,Has one day started even with that herd
3131,TWIN-BORN.,Whose swift feet now speed but at sin's behest.
3132,TWIN-BORN.,It is the same force in the human breast
3133,TWIN-BORN.,Which makes men gods or demons. If we gird
3134,TWIN-BORN.,Those strong emotions by which we are stirred
3135,TWIN-BORN.,"With might of will and purpose, heights unguessed"
3136,TWIN-BORN.,Shall dawn for us; or if we give them sway
3137,TWIN-BORN.,We can sink down and consort with the lost.
3138,TWIN-BORN.,All virtue is worth just the price it cost.
3139,TWIN-BORN.,Black sin is oft white truth that missed its way
3140,TWIN-BORN.,And wandered off in paths not understood.

3150,FLOODS.,"The uncurbed fury of the wild spring rain,"
3151,FLOODS.,"And weird winds lashing the defiant deep,"
3152,FLOODS.,And roar of floods that gather strength and leap
3153,FLOODS.,"Down dizzy, wreck-strewn channels to the main."
3154,FLOODS.,I turn upon my pillow and again
3155,FLOODS.,Compose myself for slumber.
3156,FLOODS.,Let them sweep;
3157,FLOODS.,"I once survived great floods, and do not fear,"
3158,FLOODS.,"Though ominous planets congregate, and seem"
3159,FLOODS.,To foretell strange disasters.
3160,FLOODS.,From a dream--
3161,FLOODS.,"Ah! dear God! such a dream!--I woke to hear,"
3162,FLOODS.,"Through the dense shadows lit by no star's gleam,"
3163,FLOODS.,The rush of mighty waters on my ear.
3164,FLOODS.,"Helpless, afraid, and all alone, I lay;"
3165,FLOODS.,The floods had come upon me unaware.
3166,FLOODS.,I heard the crash of structures that were fair;
3167,FLOODS.,The bridges of fond hopes were swept away
3168,FLOODS.,By great salt waves of sorrow. In dismay
3169,FLOODS.,I saw by the red lightning's lurid glare
3170,FLOODS.,That on the rock-bound island of despair
3171,FLOODS.,I had been cast. Till the dim dawn of day
3172,FLOODS.,"I heard my castles falling, and the roll"
3173,FLOODS.,Of angry billows bearing to the sea
3174,FLOODS.,The broken timbers of my very soul.
3175,FLOODS.,Were all the pent-up waters from the whole
3176,FLOODS.,"Stupendous solar system to break free,"
3177,FLOODS.,There are no floods that now can frighten me.
