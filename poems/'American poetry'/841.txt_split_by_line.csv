38,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",Preface
39,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
40,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
41,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",This is a book of stories.  For that reason I have excluded all purely
42,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","lyrical poems.  But the word ""stories"" has been stretched to its fullest"
43,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","application.  It includes both narrative poems, properly so called;"
44,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",tales divided into scenes; and a few pieces of less obvious
45,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",story-telling import in which one might say that the dramatis personae
46,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","are air, clouds, trees, houses, streets, and such like things."
47,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
48,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",It has long been a favourite idea of mine that the rhythms of 'vers
49,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","libre' have not been sufficiently plumbed, that there is in them a power"
50,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",of variation which has never yet been brought to the light of
51,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","experiment. I think it was the piano pieces of Debussy, with their"
52,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","strange likeness to short vers libre poems, which first showed me the"
53,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","close kinship of music and poetry, and there flashed into my mind the"
54,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",idea of using the movement of poetry in somewhat the same way that the
55,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",musician uses the movement of music.
56,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
57,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",It was quite evident that this could never be done in the strict pattern
58,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","of a metrical form, but the flowing, fluctuating rhythm of vers libre"
59,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","seemed to open the door to such an experiment.  First, however, I"
60,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",considered the same method as applied to the more pronounced movements
61,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","of natural objects.  If the reader will turn to the poem, ""A Roxbury"
62,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","Garden"", he will find in the first two sections an attempt to give the"
63,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","circular movement of a hoop bowling along the ground, and the up and"
64,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","down, elliptical curve of a flying shuttlecock."
65,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
66,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","From these experiments, it is but a step to the flowing rhythm of music."
67,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","In ""The Cremona Violin"", I have tried to give this flowing, changing"
68,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",rhythm to the parts in which the violin is being played.  The effect is
69,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","farther heightened, because the rest of the poem is written in the seven"
70,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","line Chaucerian stanza; and, by deserting this ordered pattern for the"
71,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","undulating line of vers libre, I hoped to produce something of the"
72,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","suave, continuous tone of a violin.  Again, in the violin parts"
73,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","themselves, the movement constantly changes, as will be quite plain to"
74,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",any one reading these passages aloud.
75,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
76,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","In ""The Cremona Violin"", however, the rhythms are fairly obvious and"
77,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",regular. I set myself a far harder task in trying to transcribe the
78,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","various movements of Stravinsky's ""Three Pieces 'Grotesques', for String"
79,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","Quartet"". Several musicians, who have seen the poem, think the movement"
80,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",accurately given.
81,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
82,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",These experiments lead me to believe that there is here much food for
83,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","thought and matter for study, and I hope many poets will follow me in"
84,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",opening up the still hardly explored possibilities of vers libre.
85,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
86,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","A good many of the poems in this book are written in ""polyphonic prose""."
87,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",A form about which I have written and spoken so much that it seems
88,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","hardly necessary to explain it here.  Let me hastily add, however, that"
89,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","the word ""prose"" in its name refers only to the typographical"
90,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","arrangement, for in no sense is this a prose form. Only read it aloud,"
91,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","Gentle Reader, I beg, and you will see what you will see. For a purely"
92,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","dramatic form, I know none better in the whole range of poetry. It"
93,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","enables the poet to give his characters the vivid, real effect they have"
94,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","in a play, while at the same time writing in the 'decor'."
95,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
96,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",One last innovation I have still to mention.  It will be found in
97,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","""Spring Day"", and more fully enlarged upon in the series, ""Towns in"
98,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","Colour"".  In these poems, I have endeavoured to give the colour, and"
99,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","light, and shade, of certain places and hours, stressing the purely"
100,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","pictorial effect, and with little or no reference to any other aspect of"
101,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",the places described.  It is an enchanting thing to wander through a
102,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","city looking for its unrelated beauty, the beauty by which it captivates"
103,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",the sensuous sense of seeing.
104,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
105,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","I have always loved aquariums, but for years I went to them and looked,"
106,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","and looked, at those swirling, shooting, looping patterns of fish, which"
107,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","always defied transcription to paper until I hit upon the ""unrelated"""
108,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","method.  The result is in ""An Aquarium"". I think the first thing which"
109,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","turned me in this direction was John Gould Fletcher's ""London"
110,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","Excursion"", in ""Some Imagist Poets"". I here record my thanks."
111,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",
112,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","For the substance of the poems--why, the poems are here. No one"
113,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",writing to-day can fail to be affected by the great war raging in Europe
114,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","at this time.  We are too near it to do more than touch upon it.  But,"
115,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","obliquely, it is suggested in many of these poems, most notably those in"
116,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","the section, ""Bronze Tablets"".  The Napoleonic Era is an epic subject,"
117,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",and waits a great epic poet.  I have only been able to open a few
118,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",windows upon it here and there.  But the scene from the windows is
119,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS","authentic, and the watcher has used eyes, and ears, and heart, in"
120,"MEN, WOMEN AND GHOSTS",watching.

207,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
208,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
209,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"I walk down the garden paths,"
210,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And all the daffodils
211,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Are blowing, and the bright blue squills."
212,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I walk down the patterned garden-paths
213,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
214,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,"
215,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I too am a rare
216,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Pattern.  As I wander down
217,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The garden paths.
218,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
219,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"My dress is richly figured,"
220,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And the train
221,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Makes a pink and silver stain
222,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"On the gravel, and the thrift"
223,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Of the borders.
224,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Just a plate of current fashion,"
225,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes."
226,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Not a softness anywhere about me,"
227,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Only whalebone and brocade.
228,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And I sink on a seat in the shade
229,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Of a lime tree.  For my passion
230,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Wars against the stiff brocade.
231,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The daffodils and squills
232,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Flutter in the breeze
233,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,As they please.
234,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And I weep;
235,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,For the lime-tree is in blossom
236,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.
237,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
238,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And the plashing of waterdrops
239,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,In the marble fountain
240,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Comes down the garden-paths.
241,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The dripping never stops.
242,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Underneath my stiffened gown
243,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,"
244,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,A basin in the midst of hedges grown
245,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,"
246,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"But she guesses he is near,"
247,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And the sliding of the water
248,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Seems the stroking of a dear
249,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Hand upon her.
250,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!
251,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.
252,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.
253,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
254,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,"
255,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"And he would stumble after,"
256,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Bewildered by my laughter.
257,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles
258,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,on his shoes.
259,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I would choose
260,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,"
261,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,"
262,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Till he caught me in the shade,"
263,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,"
264,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Aching, melting, unafraid."
265,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,"
266,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"And the plopping of the waterdrops,"
267,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,All about us in the open afternoon--
268,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I am very like to swoon
269,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"With the weight of this brocade,"
270,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,For the sun sifts through the shade.
271,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
272,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Underneath the fallen blossom
273,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"In my bosom,"
274,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Is a letter I have hid.
275,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.
276,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"""Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell"
277,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Died in action Thursday se'nnight."""
278,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,"
279,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The letters squirmed like snakes.
280,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"""Any answer, Madam,"" said my footman."
281,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"""No,"" I told him."
282,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"""See that the messenger takes some refreshment."
283,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"No, no answer."""
284,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"And I walked into the garden,"
285,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Up and down the patterned paths,"
286,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"In my stiff, correct brocade."
287,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,"
288,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Each one.
289,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"I stood upright too,"
290,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Held rigid to the pattern
291,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,By the stiffness of my gown.
292,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Up and down I walked,"
293,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Up and down.
294,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
295,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,In a month he would have been my husband.
296,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"In a month, here, underneath this lime,"
297,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,We would have broke the pattern;
298,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"He for me, and I for him,"
299,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"He as Colonel, I as Lady,"
300,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,On this shady seat.
301,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,He had a whim
302,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,That sunlight carried blessing.
303,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"And I answered, ""It shall be as you have said."""
304,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Now he is dead.
305,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,
306,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
307,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Up and down
308,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The patterned garden-paths
309,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"In my stiff, brocaded gown."
310,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,The squills and daffodils
311,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow."
312,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,I shall go
313,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Up and down,"
314,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,In my gown.
315,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Gorgeously arrayed,"
316,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Boned and stayed.
317,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
318,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"By each button, hook, and lace."
319,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"For the man who should loose me is dead,"
320,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,"Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,"
321,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,In a pattern called a war.
322,FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE,Christ!  What are patterns for?

336,I,Let drop the yellow sunshine to gleam through
337,I,And tip the edges of the waves with shifts
338,I,"And spots of whitest fire, hard like gems"
339,I,"Cut from the midnight moon they were, and sharp"
340,I,As wind through leafless stems.
341,I,The Lady Eunice walked between the drifts

351,II,"Of fallen petals on the grass, could please"
352,II,Her not at all.  She brushed a hair aside
353,II,"With a swift move, and a half-angry frown."
354,II,"She stopped to pull a daffodil or two,"
355,II,And held them to her gown
356,II,"To test the colours; put them at her side,"
357,II,"Then at her breast, then loosened them and tried"

366,III,Too apathetic even to rebuke
367,III,Her idleness.  What is she on this Earth?
368,III,"No woman surely, since she neither can"
369,III,"Be wed nor single, must not let her mind"
370,III,Build thoughts upon a man
371,III,Except for hers.  Indeed that were no dearth
372,III,"Were her Lord here, for well she knew his worth,"
373,III,And when she thought of him her eyes were kind.

378,IV,Too lately wed to have forgot the wooing.
379,IV,Too unaccustomed as a bride to feel
380,IV,Other than strange delight at her wife's doing.
381,IV,Even at the thought a gentle blush would steal
382,IV,"Over her face, and then her lips would frame"
383,IV,"Some little word of loving, and her eyes"
384,IV,"Would brim and spill their tears, when all they saw"
385,IV,"Was the bright sun, slantwise"
386,IV,"Through burgeoning trees, and all the morning's flame"

396,V,He'd left her here in charge of.  Then a spell
397,V,Of conscience sent her through the orchard spying
398,V,Upon the gardeners.  Were their tools about?
399,V,Were any branches broken?  Had the weeds
400,V,Been duly taken out

411,VI,"Were strewn with fair, red gravel by her orders."
412,VI,No stone could mar their sifted smoothness.  So
413,VI,She hurried to the river.  At the edge
414,VI,She stood a moment charmed by the swift blue
415,VI,Beyond the river sedge.
416,VI,"She watched it curdling, crinkling, and the snow"
417,VI,"Purfled upon its wave-tops.  Then, ""Hullo,"
418,VI,"My Beauty, gently, or you'll wriggle through."""

422,VII,
423,VII,The Lady Eunice caught a willow spray
424,VII,To save herself from tumbling in the shallows
425,VII,Which rippled to her feet.  Then straight away
426,VII,She peered down stream among the budding sallows.
427,VII,A youth in leather breeches and a shirt
428,VII,Of finest broidered lawn lay out upon
429,VII,An overhanging bole and deftly swayed
430,VII,A well-hooked fish which shone
431,VII,In the pale lemon sunshine like a spurt
432,VII,"Of silver, bowed and damascened, and girt"
433,VII,With crimson spots and moons which waned and played.
434,VII,
435,VII,
436,VIII,VIII
437,VIII,
438,VIII,"The fish hung circled for a moment, ringed"
439,VIII,"And bright; then flung itself out, a thin blade"
440,VIII,"Of spotted lightning, and its tail was winged"
441,VIII,With chipped and sparkled sunshine.  And the shade
442,VIII,Broke up and splintered into shafts of light
443,VIII,"Wheeling about the fish, who churned the air"
444,VIII,"And made the fish-line hum, and bent the rod"
445,VIII,Almost to snapping.  Care
446,VIII,"The young man took against the twigs, with slight,"
447,VIII,Deft movements he kept fish and line in tight
448,VIII,Obedience to his will with every prod.
449,VIII,
450,VIII,
451,IX,IX
452,IX,
453,IX,"He lay there, and the fish hung just beyond."
454,IX,He seemed uncertain what more he should do.
455,IX,"He drew back, pulled the rod to correspond,"
456,IX,"Tossed it and caught it; every time he threw,"
457,IX,He caught it nearer to the point.  At last
458,IX,The fish was near enough to touch.  He paused.
459,IX,"Eunice knew well the craft--""What's got the thing!"""
460,IX,"She cried.  ""What can have caused--"
461,IX,Where is his net?  The moment will be past.
462,IX,"The fish will wriggle free.""  She stopped aghast."
463,IX,He turned and bowed.  One arm was in a sling.
464,IX,
465,IX,
466,X,X
467,X,
468,X,"The broad, black ribbon she had thought his basket"
469,X,"Must hang from, held instead a useless arm."
470,X,"""I do not wonder, Madam, that you ask it."""
471,X,"He smiled, for she had spoke aloud.  ""The charm"
472,X,Of trout fishing is in my eyes enhanced
473,X,"When you must play your fish on land as well."""
474,X,"""How will you take him?"" Eunice asked.  ""In truth"
475,X,I really cannot tell.
476,X,"'Twas stupid of me, but it simply chanced"
477,X,I never thought of that until he glanced
478,X,"Into the branches.  'Tis a bit uncouth."""
479,X,
480,X,
481,XI,XI
482,XI,
483,XI,"He watched the fish against the blowing sky,"
484,XI,"Writhing and glittering, pulling at the line."
485,XI,"""The hook is fast, I might just let him die,"""
486,XI,"He mused.  ""But that would jar against your fine"
487,XI,"Sense of true sportsmanship, I know it would,"""
488,XI,"Cried Eunice.  ""Let me do it.""  Swift and light"
489,XI,"She ran towards him.  ""It is so long now"
490,XI,"Since I have felt a bite,"
491,XI,"I lost all heart for everything.""  She stood,"
492,XI,"Supple and strong, beside him, and her blood"
493,XI,Tingled her lissom body to a glow.
494,XI,
495,XI,
496,XII,XII
497,XII,
498,XII,She quickly seized the fish and with a stone
499,XII,"Ended its flurry, then removed the hook,"
500,XII,"Untied the fly with well-poised fingers.  Done,"
501,XII,She asked him where he kept his fishing-book.
502,XII,He pointed to a coat flung on the ground.
503,XII,"She searched the pockets, found a shagreen case,"
504,XII,"Replaced the fly, noticed a golden stamp"
505,XII,Filling the middle space.
506,XII,"Two letters half rubbed out were there, and round"
507,XII,About them gay rococo flowers wound
508,XII,And tossed a spray of roses to the clamp.
509,XII,
510,XII,
511,XIII,XIII
512,XIII,
513,XIII,The Lady Eunice puzzled over these.
514,XIII,"""G. D."" the young man gravely said.  ""My name"
515,XIII,"Is Gervase Deane.  Your servant, if you please."""
516,XIII,"""Oh, Sir, indeed I know you, for your fame"
517,XIII,For exploits in the field has reached my ears.
518,XIII,"I did not know you wounded and returned."""
519,XIII,"""But just come back, Madam.  A silly prick"
520,XIII,To gain me such unearned
521,XIII,"Holiday making.  And you, it appears,"
522,XIII,Must be Sir Everard's lady.  And my fears
523,XIII,"At being caught a-trespassing were quick."""
524,XIII,
525,XIII,
526,XIV,XIV
527,XIV,
528,XIV,He looked so rueful that she laughed out loud.
529,XIV,"""You are forgiven, Mr. Deane.  Even more,"
530,XIV,"I offer you the fishing, and am proud"
531,XIV,That you should find it pleasant from this shore.
532,XIV,"Nobody fishes now, my husband used"
533,XIV,"To angle daily, and I too with him."
534,XIV,"He loved the spotted trout, and pike, and dace."
535,XIV,He even had a whim
536,XIV,That flies my fingers tied swiftly confused
537,XIV,"The greater fish.  And he must be excused,"
538,XIV,"Love weaves odd fancies in a lonely place."""
539,XIV,
540,XIV,
541,XV,XV
542,XV,
543,XV,"She sighed because it seemed so long ago,"
544,XV,Those days with Everard; unthinking took
545,XV,The path back to the orchard.  Strolling so
546,XV,"She walked, and he beside her.  In a nook"
547,XV,"Where a stone seat withdrew beneath low boughs,"
548,XV,"Full-blossomed, hummed with bees, they sat them down."
549,XV,"She questioned him about the war, the share"
550,XV,"Her husband had, and grown"
551,XV,"Eager by his clear answers, straight allows"
552,XV,"Her hidden hopes and fears to speak, and rouse"
553,XV,"Her numbed love, which had slumbered unaware."
554,XV,
555,XV,
556,XVI,XVI
557,XVI,
558,XVI,Under the orchard trees daffodils danced
559,XVI,"And jostled, turning sideways to the wind."
560,XVI,A dropping cherry petal softly glanced
561,XVI,"Over her hair, and slid away behind."
562,XVI,At the far end through twisted cherry-trees
563,XVI,"The old house glowed, geranium-hued, with bricks"
564,XVI,"Bloomed in the sun like roses, low and long,"
565,XVI,"Gabled, and with quaint tricks"
566,XVI,Of chimneys carved and fretted.  Out of these
567,XVI,"Grey smoke was shaken, which the faint Spring breeze"
568,XVI,Tossed into nothing.  Then a thrush's song
569,XVI,
570,XVI,
571,XVII,XVII
572,XVII,
573,XVII,Needled its way through sound of bees and river.
574,XVII,"The notes fell, round and starred, between young leaves,"
575,XVII,"Trilled to a spiral lilt, stopped on a quiver."
576,XVII,The Lady Eunice listens and believes.
577,XVII,"Gervase has many tales of her dear Lord,"
578,XVII,"His bravery, his knowledge, his charmed life."
579,XVII,She quite forgets who's speaking in the gladness
580,XVII,Of being this man's wife.
581,XVII,"Gervase is wounded, grave indeed, the word"
582,XVII,"Is kindly said, but to a softer chord"
583,XVII,"She strings her voice to ask with wistful sadness,"
584,XVII,
585,XVII,
586,XVIII,XVIII
587,XVIII,
588,XVIII,"""And is Sir Everard still unscathed?  I fain"
589,XVIII,"Would know the truth.""  ""Quite well, dear Lady, quite."""
590,XVIII,"She smiled in her content.  ""So many slain,"
591,XVIII,"You must forgive me for a little fright."""
592,XVIII,"And he forgave her, not alone for that,"
593,XVIII,"But because she was fingering his heart,"
594,XVIII,"Pressing and squeezing it, and thinking so"
595,XVIII,Only to ease her smart
596,XVIII,"Of painful, apprehensive longing.  At"
597,XVIII,Their feet the river swirled and chucked.  They sat
598,XVIII,An hour there.  The thrush flew to and fro.
599,XVIII,
600,XVIII,
601,XIX,XIX
602,XIX,
603,XIX,"The Lady Eunice supped alone that day,"
604,XIX,"As always since Sir Everard had gone,"
605,XIX,"In the oak-panelled parlour, whose array"
606,XIX,Of faded portraits in carved mouldings shone.
607,XIX,"Warriors and ladies, armoured, ruffed, peruked."
608,XIX,"Van Dykes with long, slim fingers; Holbeins, stout"
609,XIX,"And heavy-featured; and one Rubens dame,"
610,XIX,"A peony just burst out,"
611,XIX,"With flaunting, crimson flesh.  Eunice rebuked"
612,XIX,"Her thoughts of gentler blood, when these had duked"
613,XIX,"It with the best, and scorned to change their name."
614,XIX,
615,XIX,
616,XX,XX
617,XX,
618,XX,"A sturdy family, and old besides,"
619,XX,"Much older than her own, the Earls of Crowe."
620,XX,"Since Saxon days, these men had sought their brides"
621,XX,"Among the highest born, but always so,"
622,XX,"Taking them to themselves, their wealth, their lands,"
623,XX,"But never their titles.  Stern perhaps, but strong,"
624,XX,"The Framptons fed their blood from richest streams,"
625,XX,Scorning the common throng.
626,XX,"Gazing upon these men, she understands"
627,XX,The toughness of the web wrought from such strands
628,XX,And pride of Everard colours all her dreams.
629,XX,
630,XX,
631,XXI,XXI
632,XXI,
633,XXI,"Eunice forgets to eat, watching their faces"
634,XXI,Flickering in the wind-blown candle's shine.
635,XXI,"Blue-coated lackeys tiptoe to their places,"
636,XXI,And set out plates of fruit and jugs of wine.
637,XXI,The table glitters black like Winter ice.
638,XXI,"The Dartle's rushing, and the gentle clash"
639,XXI,"Of blossomed branches, drifts into her ears."
640,XXI,And through the casement sash
641,XXI,She sees each cherry stem a pointed slice
642,XXI,"Of splintered moonlight, topped with all the spice"
643,XXI,And shimmer of the blossoms it uprears.
644,XXI,
645,XXI,
646,XXII,XXII
647,XXII,
648,XXII,"""In such a night--"" she laid the book aside,"
649,XXII,She could outnight the poet by thinking back.
650,XXII,In such a night she came here as a bride.
651,XXII,The date was graven in the almanack
652,XXII,Of her clasped memory.  In this very room
653,XXII,Had Everard uncloaked her.  On this seat
654,XXII,"Had drawn her to him, bade her note the trees,"
655,XXII,How white they were and sweet
656,XXII,"And later, coming to her, her dear groom,"
657,XXII,"Her Lord, had lain beside her in the gloom"
658,XXII,"Of moon and shade, and whispered her to ease."
659,XXII,
660,XXII,
661,XXIII,XXIII
662,XXIII,
663,XXIII,"Her little taper made the room seem vast,"
664,XXIII,Caverned and empty.  And her beating heart
665,XXIII,Rapped through the silence all about her cast
666,XXIII,"Like some loud, dreadful death-watch taking part"
667,XXIII,"In this sad vigil.  Slowly she undrest,"
668,XXIII,Put out the light and crept into her bed.
669,XXIII,"The linen sheets were fragrant, but so cold."
670,XXIII,"And brimming tears she shed,"
671,XXIII,"Sobbing and quivering in her barren nest,"
672,XXIII,"Her weeping lips into the pillow prest,"
673,XXIII,Her eyes sealed fast within its smothering fold.
674,XXIII,
675,XXIII,
676,XXIV,XXIV
677,XXIV,
678,XXIV,"The morning brought her a more stoic mind,"
679,XXIV,And sunshine struck across the polished floor.
680,XXIV,She wondered whether this day she should find
681,XXIV,"Gervase a-fishing, and so listen more,"
682,XXIV,"Much more again, to all he had to tell."
683,XXIV,"And he was there, but waiting to begin"
684,XXIV,"Until she came.  They fished awhile, then went"
685,XXIV,To the old seat within
686,XXIV,The cherry's shade.  He pleased her very well
687,XXIV,By his discourse.  But ever he must dwell
688,XXIV,Upon Sir Everard.  Each incident
689,XXIV,
690,XXIV,
691,XXV,XXV
692,XXV,
693,XXV,Must be related and each term explained.
694,XXV,"How troops were set in battle, how a siege"
695,XXV,Was ordered and conducted.  She complained
696,XXV,Because he bungled at the fall of Liege.
697,XXV,"The curious names of parts of forts she knew,"
698,XXV,"And aired with conscious pride her ravelins,"
699,XXV,"And counterscarps, and lunes.  The day drew on,"
700,XXV,And his dead fish's fins
701,XXV,In the hot sunshine turned a mauve-green hue.
702,XXV,"At last Gervase, guessing the hour, withdrew."
703,XXV,But she sat long in still oblivion.
704,XXV,
705,XXV,
706,XXVI,XXVI
707,XXVI,
708,XXVI,"Then he would bring her books, and read to her"
709,XXVI,"The poems of Dr. Donne, and the blue river"
710,XXVI,"Would murmur through the reading, and a stir"
711,XXVI,"Of birds and bees make the white petals shiver,"
712,XXVI,And one or two would flutter prone and lie
713,XXVI,Spotting the smooth-clipped grass.  The days went by
714,XXVI,Threaded with talk and verses.  Green leaves pushed
715,XXVI,Through blossoms stubbornly.
716,XXVI,"Gervase, unconscious of dishonesty,"
717,XXVI,"Fell into strong and watchful loving, free"
718,XXVI,"He thought, since always would his lips be hushed."
719,XXVI,
720,XXVI,
721,XXVII,XXVII
722,XXVII,
723,XXVII,"But lips do not stay silent at command,"
724,XXVII,And Gervase strove in vain to order his.
725,XXVII,Luckily Eunice did not understand
726,XXVII,"That he but read himself aloud, for this"
727,XXVII,Their friendship would have snapped.  She treated him
728,XXVII,And spoilt him like a brother.  It was now
729,XXVII,"""Gervase"" and ""Eunice"" with them, and he dined"
730,XXVII,"Whenever she'd allow,"
731,XXVII,"In the oak parlour, underneath the dim"
732,XXVII,"Old pictured Framptons, opposite her slim"
733,XXVII,"Figure, so bright against the chair behind."
734,XXVII,
735,XXVII,
736,XXVIII,XXVIII
737,XXVIII,
738,XXVIII,Eunice was happier than she had been
739,XXVIII,"For many days, and yet the hours were long."
740,XXVIII,All Gervase told to her but made her lean
741,XXVIII,More heavily upon the past.  Among
742,XXVIII,"Her hopes she lived, even when she was giving"
743,XXVIII,"Her morning orders, even when she twined"
744,XXVIII,Nosegays to deck her parlours.  With the thought
745,XXVIII,"Of Everard, her mind"
746,XXVIII,"Solaced its solitude, and in her striving"
747,XXVIII,To do as he would wish was all her living.
748,XXVIII,She welcomed Gervase for the news he brought.
749,XXVIII,
750,XXVIII,
751,XXIX,XXIX
752,XXIX,
753,XXIX,"Black-hearts and white-hearts, bubbled with the sun,"
754,XXIX,Hid in their leaves and knocked against each other.
755,XXIX,"Eunice was standing, panting with her run"
756,XXIX,Up to the tool-house just to get another
757,XXIX,"Basket.  All those which she had brought were filled,"
758,XXIX,And still Gervase pelted her from above.
759,XXIX,The buckles of his shoes flashed higher and higher
760,XXIX,Until his shoulders strove
761,XXIX,"Quite through the top.  ""Eunice, your spirit's filled"
762,XXIX,"This tree.  White-hearts!""  He shook, and cherries spilled"
763,XXIX,And spat out from the leaves like falling fire.
764,XXIX,
765,XXIX,
766,XXX,XXX
767,XXX,
768,XXX,"The wide, sun-winged June morning spread itself"
769,XXX,Over the quiet garden.  And they packed
770,XXX,"Full twenty baskets with the fruit.  ""My shelf"
771,XXX,Of cordials will be stored with what it lacked.
772,XXX,"In future, none of us will drink strong ale,"
773,XXX,"But cherry-brandy.""  ""Vastly good, I vow,"""
774,XXX,And Gervase gave the tree another shake.
775,XXX,The cherries seemed to flow
776,XXX,"Out of the sky in cloudfuls, like blown hail."
777,XXX,"Swift Lady Eunice ran, her farthingale,"
778,XXX,"Unnoticed, tangling in a fallen rake."
779,XXX,
780,XXX,
781,XXXI,XXXI
782,XXXI,
783,XXXI,She gave a little cry and fell quite prone
784,XXXI,"In the long grass, and lay there very still."
785,XXXI,"Gervase leapt from the tree at her soft moan,"
786,XXXI,"And kneeling over her, with clumsy skill"
787,XXXI,"Unloosed her bodice, fanned her with his hat,"
788,XXXI,And his unguarded lips pronounced his heart.
789,XXXI,"""Eunice, my Dearest Girl, where are you hurt?"""
790,XXXI,His trembling fingers dart
791,XXXI,Over her limbs seeking some wound.  She strove
792,XXXI,"To answer, opened wide her eyes, above"
793,XXXI,"Her knelt Sir Everard, with face alert."
794,XXXI,
795,XXXI,
796,XXXII,XXXII
797,XXXII,
798,XXXII,"Her eyelids fell again at that sweet sight,"
799,XXXII,"""My Love!"" she murmured, ""Dearest!  Oh, my Dear!"""
800,XXXII,He took her in his arms and bore her right
801,XXXII,"And tenderly to the old seat, and ""Here"
802,XXXII,"I have you mine at last,"" she said, and swooned"
803,XXXII,Under his kisses.  When she came once more
804,XXXII,"To sight of him, she smiled in comfort knowing"
805,XXXII,Herself laid as before
806,XXXII,Close covered on his breast.  And all her glowing
807,XXXII,"Youth answered him, and ever nearer growing"
808,XXXII,She twined him in her arms and soft festooned
809,XXXII,
810,XXXII,
811,XXXIII,XXXIII
812,XXXIII,
813,XXXIII,"Herself about him like a flowering vine,"
814,XXXIII,Drawing his lips to cling upon her own.
815,XXXIII,A ray of sunlight pierced the leaves to shine
816,XXXIII,Where her half-opened bodice let be shown
817,XXXIII,"Her white throat fluttering to his soft caress,"
818,XXXIII,Half-gasping with her gladness.  And her pledge
819,XXXIII,"She whispers, melting with delight.  A twig"
820,XXXIII,Snaps in the hornbeam hedge.
821,XXXIII,A cackling laugh tears through the quietness.
822,XXXIII,Eunice starts up in terrible distress.
823,XXXIII,"""My God!  What's that?""  Her staring eyes are big."
824,XXXIII,
825,XXXIII,
826,XXXIV,XXXIV
827,XXXIV,
828,XXXIV,Revulsed emotion set her body shaking
829,XXXIV,"As though she had an ague.  Gervase swore,"
830,XXXIV,Jumped to his feet in such a dreadful taking
831,XXXIV,His face was ghastly with the look it wore.
832,XXXIV,"Crouching and slipping through the trees, a man"
833,XXXIV,"In worn, blue livery, a humpbacked thing,"
834,XXXIV,Made off.  But turned every few steps to gaze
835,XXXIV,"At Eunice, and to fling"
836,XXXIV,"Vile looks and gestures back.  ""The ruffian!"
837,XXXIV,By Christ's Death!  I will split him to a span
838,XXXIV,"Of hog's thongs.""  She grasped at his sleeve, ""Gervase!"
839,XXXIV,
840,XXXIV,
841,XXXV,XXXV
842,XXXV,
843,XXXV,"What are you doing here?  Put down that sword,"
844,XXXV,"That's only poor old Tony, crazed and lame."
845,XXXV,We never notice him.  With my dear Lord
846,XXXV,I ought not to have minded that he came.
847,XXXV,"But, Gervase, it surprises me that you"
848,XXXV,"Should so lack grace to stay here.""  With one hand"
849,XXXV,She held her gaping bodice to conceal
850,XXXV,"Her breast.  ""I must demand"
851,XXXV,"Your instant absence.  Everard, but new"
852,XXXV,"Returned, will hardly care for guests.  Adieu."""
853,XXXV,"""Eunice, you're mad.""  His brain began to reel."
854,XXXV,
855,XXXV,
856,XXXVI,XXXVI
857,XXXVI,
858,XXXVI,"He tried again to take her, tried to twist"
859,XXXVI,"Her arms about him.  Truly, she had said"
860,XXXVI,Nothing should ever part them.  In a mist
861,XXXVI,"She pushed him from her, clasped her aching head"
862,XXXVI,"In both her hands, and rocked and sobbed aloud."
863,XXXVI,"""Oh!  Where is Everard?  What does this mean?"
864,XXXVI,"So lately come to leave me thus alone!"""
865,XXXVI,But Gervase had not seen
866,XXXVI,"Sir Everard.  Then, gently, to her bowed"
867,XXXVI,"And sickening spirit, he told of her proud"
868,XXXVI,Surrender to him.  He could hear her moan.
869,XXXVI,
870,XXXVI,
871,XXXVII,XXXVII
872,XXXVII,
873,XXXVII,"Then shame swept over her and held her numb,"
874,XXXVII,Hiding her anguished face against the seat.
875,XXXVII,"At last she rose, a woman stricken--dumb--"
876,XXXVII,And trailed away with slowly-dragging feet.
877,XXXVII,"Gervase looked after her, but feared to pass"
878,XXXVII,The barrier set between them.  All his rare
879,XXXVII,"Joy broke to fragments--worse than that, unreal."
880,XXXVII,"And standing lonely there,"
881,XXXVII,"His swollen heart burst out, and on the grass"
882,XXXVII,"He flung himself and wept.  He knew, alas!"
883,XXXVII,The loss so great his life could never heal.

888,XXXVIII,"For days thereafter Eunice lived retired,"
889,XXXVIII,Waited upon by one old serving-maid.
890,XXXVIII,"She would not leave her chamber, and desired"
891,XXXVIII,Only to hide herself.  She was afraid
892,XXXVIII,"Of what her eyes might trick her into seeing,"
893,XXXVIII,Of what her longing urge her then to do.
894,XXXVIII,What was this dreadful illness solitude
895,XXXVIII,Had tortured her into?
896,XXXVIII,Her hours went by in a long constant fleeing
897,XXXVIII,The thought of that one morning.  And her being
898,XXXVIII,Bruised itself on a happening so rude.
899,XXXVIII,

901,XXXIX,XXXIX
902,XXXIX,
903,XXXIX,"It grew ripe Summer, when one morning came"
904,XXXIX,"Her tirewoman with a letter, printed"
905,XXXIX,Upon the seal were the Deane crest and name.
906,XXXIX,"With utmost gentleness, the letter hinted"
907,XXXIX,His understanding and his deep regret.
908,XXXIX,But would she not permit him once again
909,XXXIX,To pay her his profound respects?  No word
910,XXXIX,Of what had passed should pain
911,XXXIX,Her resolution.  Only let them get
912,XXXIX,Back the old comradeship.  Her eyes were wet
913,XXXIX,"With starting tears, now truly she deplored"
914,XXXIX,
915,XXXIX,
916,XL,XL
917,XL,
918,XL,"His misery.  Yes, she was wrong to keep"
919,XL,Away from him.  He hardly was to blame.
920,XL,'Twas she--she shuddered and began to weep.
921,XL,'Twas her fault!  Hers!  Her everlasting shame
922,XL,"Was that she suffered him, whom not at all"
923,XL,"She loved.  Poor Boy!  Yes, they must still be friends."
924,XL,She owed him that to keep the balance straight.
925,XL,It was such poor amends
926,XL,Which she could make for rousing hopes to gall
927,XL,Him with their unfulfilment.  Tragical
928,XL,"It was, and she must leave him desolate."
929,XL,
930,XL,
931,XLI,XLI
932,XLI,
933,XLI,Hard silence he had forced upon his lips
934,XLI,"For long and long, and would have done so still"
935,XLI,Had not she--here she pressed her finger tips
936,XLI,Against her heavy eyes.  Then with forced will
937,XLI,"She wrote that he might come, sealed with the arms"
938,XLI,Of Crowe and Frampton twined.  Her heart felt lighter
939,XLI,When this was done.  It seemed her constant care
940,XLI,Might some day cease to fright her.
941,XLI,"Illness could be no crime, and dreadful harms"
942,XLI,Did come from too much sunshine.  Her alarms
943,XLI,"Would lessen when she saw him standing there,"
944,XLI,
945,XLI,
946,XLII,XLII
947,XLII,
948,XLII,"Simple and kind, a brother just returned"
949,XLII,"From journeying, and he would treat her so."
950,XLII,"She knew his honest heart, and if there burned"
951,XLII,A spark in it he would not let it show.
952,XLII,"But when he really came, and stood beside"
953,XLII,"Her underneath the fruitless cherry boughs,"
954,XLII,"He seemed a tired man, gaunt, leaden-eyed."
955,XLII,"He made her no more vows,"
956,XLII,Nor did he mention one thing he had tried
957,XLII,To put into his letter.  War supplied
958,XLII,Him topics.  And his mind seemed occupied.
959,XLII,
960,XLII,
961,XLIII,XLIII
962,XLIII,
963,XLIII,Daily they met.  And gravely walked and talked.
964,XLIII,"He read her no more verses, and he stayed"
965,XLIII,"Only until their conversation, balked"
966,XLIII,"Of every natural channel, fled dismayed."
967,XLIII,"Again the next day she would meet him, trying"
968,XLIII,"To give her tone some healthy sprightliness,"
969,XLIII,But his uneager dignity soon chilled
970,XLIII,Her well-prepared address.
971,XLIII,"Thus Summer waned, and in the mornings, crying"
972,XLIII,"Of wild geese startled Eunice, and their flying"
973,XLIII,Whirred overhead for days and never stilled.

977,XLIV,
978,XLIV,"One afternoon of grey clouds and white wind,"
979,XLIV,Eunice awaited Gervase by the river.
980,XLIV,The Dartle splashed among the reeds and whined
981,XLIV,"Over the willow-roots, and a long sliver"
982,XLIV,Of caked and slobbered foam crept up the bank.
983,XLIV,"All through the garden, drifts of skirling leaves"
984,XLIV,"Blew up, and settled down, and blew again."
985,XLIV,The cherry-trees were weaves
986,XLIV,"Of empty, knotted branches, and a dank"
987,XLIV,"Mist hid the house, mouldy it smelt and rank"
988,XLIV,"With sodden wood, and still unfalling rain."
989,XLIV,
990,XLIV,
991,XLV,XLV
992,XLV,
993,XLV,Eunice paced up and down.  No joy she took
994,XLV,"At meeting Gervase, but the custom grown"
995,XLV,"Still held her.  He was late.  She sudden shook,"
996,XLV,And caught at her stopped heart.  Her eyes had shown
997,XLV,Sir Everard emerging from the mist.
998,XLV,"His uniform was travel-stained and torn,"
999,XLV,"His jackboots muddy, and his eager stride"
1000,XLV,Jangled his spurs.  A thorn
1001,XLV,"Entangled, trailed behind him.  To the tryst"
1002,XLV,"He hastened.  Eunice shuddered, ran--a twist"
1003,XLV,Round a sharp turning and she fled to hide.
1004,XLV,
1005,XLV,
1006,XLVI,XLVI
1007,XLVI,
1008,XLVI,"But he had seen her as she swiftly ran,"
1009,XLVI,A flash of white against the river's grey.
1010,XLVI,"""Eunice,"" he called.  ""My Darling.  Eunice.  Can"
1011,XLVI,You hear me?  It is Everard.  All day
1012,XLVI,I have been riding like the very devil
1013,XLVI,"To reach you sooner.  Are you startled, Dear?"""
1014,XLVI,"He broke into a run and followed her,"
1015,XLVI,"And caught her, faint with fear,"
1016,XLVI,Cowering and trembling as though she some evil
1017,XLVI,"Spirit were seeing.  ""What means this uncivil"
1018,XLVI,"Greeting, Dear Heart?""  He saw her senses blur."

1021,XLVII,XLVII
1022,XLVII,
1023,XLVII,"Swaying and catching at the seat, she tried"
1024,XLVII,"To speak, but only gurgled in her throat."
1025,XLVII,"At last, straining to hold herself, she cried"
1026,XLVII,"To him for pity, and her strange words smote"
1027,XLVII,"A coldness through him, for she begged Gervase"
1028,XLVII,"To leave her, 'twas too much a second time."
1029,XLVII,"Gervase must go, always Gervase, her mind"
1030,XLVII,Repeated like a rhyme
1031,XLVII,This name he did not know.  In sad amaze
1032,XLVII,"He watched her, and that hunted, fearful gaze,"
1033,XLVII,So unremembering and so unkind.
1034,XLVII,
1035,XLVII,
1036,XLVIII,XLVIII
1037,XLVIII,
1038,XLVIII,"Softly he spoke to her, patiently dealt"
1039,XLVIII,With what he feared her madness.  By and by
1040,XLVIII,He pierced her understanding.  Then he knelt
1041,XLVIII,"Upon the seat, and took her hands:  ""Now try"
1042,XLVIII,"To think a minute I am come, my Dear,"
1043,XLVIII,Unharmed and back on furlough.  Are you glad
1044,XLVIII,"To have your lover home again?  To me,"
1045,XLVIII,Pickthorn has never had
1046,XLVIII,A greater pleasantness.  Could you not bear
1047,XLVIII,To come and sit awhile beside me here?
1048,XLVIII,"A stone between us surely should not be."""

1051,XLIX,XLIX
1052,XLIX,
1053,XLIX,"She smiled a little wan and ravelled smile,"
1054,XLIX,Then came to him and on his shoulder laid
1055,XLIX,"Her head, and they two rested there awhile,"
1056,XLIX,Each taking comfort.  Not a word was said.
1057,XLIX,But when he put his hand upon her breast
1058,XLIX,"And felt her beating heart, and with his lips"
1059,XLIX,Sought solace for her and himself.  She started
1060,XLIX,"As one sharp lashed with whips,"
1061,XLIX,"And pushed him from her, moaning, his dumb quest"
1062,XLIX,"Denied and shuddered from.  And he, distrest,"
1063,XLIX,"Loosened his wife, and long they sat there, parted."

1067,L,
1068,L,"Eunice was very quiet all that day,"
1069,L,"A little dazed, and yet she seemed content."
1070,L,"At candle-time, he asked if she would play"
1071,L,"Upon her harpsichord, at once she went"
1072,L,And tinkled airs from Lully's 'Carnival'
1073,L,"And 'Bacchus', newly brought away from France."
1074,L,Then jaunted through a lively rigadoon
1075,L,To please him with a dance
1076,L,"By Purcell, for he said that surely all"
1077,L,Good Englishmen had pride in national
1078,L,Accomplishment.  But tiring of it soon
1079,L,
1080,L,
1081,LI,LI
1082,LI,
1083,LI,He whispered her that if she had forgiven
1084,LI,"His startling her that afternoon, the clock"
1085,LI,Marked early bed-time.  Surely it was Heaven
1086,LI,He entered when she opened to his knock.
1087,LI,The hours rustled in the trailing wind
1088,LI,Over the chimney.  Close they lay and knew
1089,LI,Only that they were wedded.  At his touch
1090,LI,Anxiety she threw
1091,LI,"Away like a shed garment, and inclined"
1092,LI,"Herself to cherish him, her happy mind"
1093,LI,"Quivering, unthinking, loving overmuch."
1094,LI,
1095,LI,
1096,LII,LII
1097,LII,
1098,LII,Eunice lay long awake in the cool night
1099,LII,After her husband slept.  She gazed with joy
1100,LII,"Into the shadows, painting them with bright"
1101,LII,Pictures of all her future life's employ.
1102,LII,"Twin gems they were, set to a single jewel,"
1103,LII,Each shining with the other.  Soft she turned
1104,LII,"And felt his breath upon her hair, and prayed"
1105,LII,Her happiness was earned.
1106,LII,Past Earls of Crowe should give their blood for fuel
1107,LII,To light this Frampton's hearth-fire.  By no cruel
1108,LII,Affrightings would she ever be dismayed.

1113,LIII,"When Everard, next day, asked her in joke"
1114,LIII,"What name it was that she had called him by,"
1115,LIII,"She told him of Gervase, and as she spoke"
1116,LIII,She hardly realized it was a lie.
1117,LIII,"Her vision she related, but she hid"
1118,LIII,The fondness into which she had been led.
1119,LIII,"Sir Everard just laughed and pinched her ear,"
1120,LIII,And quite out of her head
1121,LIII,The matter drifted.  Then Sir Everard chid
1122,LIII,"Himself for laziness, and off he rid"
1123,LIII,To see his men and count his farming-gear.

1127,LIV,
1128,LIV,"At supper he seemed overspread with gloom,"
1129,LIV,"But gave no reason why, he only asked"
1130,LIV,"More questions of Gervase, and round the room"
1131,LIV,He walked with restless strides.  At last he tasked
1132,LIV,Her with a greater feeling for this man
1133,LIV,Than she had given.  Eunice quick denied
1134,LIV,The slightest interest other than a friend
1135,LIV,Might claim.  But he replied
1136,LIV,He thought she underrated.  Then a ban
1137,LIV,He put on talk and music.  He'd a plan
1138,LIV,"To work at, draining swamps at Pickthorn End."

1140,LIV,
1141,LV,LV
1142,LV,
1143,LV,"Next morning Eunice found her Lord still changed,"
1144,LV,"Hard and unkind, with bursts of anger.  Pride"
1145,LV,Kept him from speaking out.  His probings ranged
1146,LV,All round his torment.  Lady Eunice tried
1147,LV,"To sooth him.  So a week went by, and then"
1148,LV,His anguish flooded over; with clenched hands
1149,LV,"Striving to stem his words, he told her plain"
1150,LV,"Tony had seen them, ""brands"
1151,LV,"Burning in Hell,"" the man had said.  Again"
1152,LV,"Eunice described her vision, and how when"
1153,LV,Awoke at last she had known dreadful pain.
1154,LV,
1155,LV,
1156,LVI,LVI
1157,LVI,
1158,LVI,"He could not credit it, and misery fed"
1159,LVI,"Upon his spirit, day by day it grew."
1160,LVI,"To Gervase he forbade the house, and led"
1161,LVI,The Lady Eunice such a life she flew
1162,LVI,At his approaching footsteps.  Winter came
1163,LVI,Snowing and blustering through the Manor trees.
1164,LVI,All the roof-edges spiked with icicles
1165,LVI,In fluted companies.
1166,LVI,The Lady Eunice with her tambour-frame
1167,LVI,Kept herself sighing company.  The flame
1168,LVI,Of the birch fire glittered on the walls.
1169,LVI,
1170,LVI,
1171,LVII,LVII
1172,LVII,
1173,LVII,"A letter was brought to her as she sat,"
1174,LVII,"Unsealed, unsigned.  It told her that his wound,"
1175,LVII,"The writer's, had so well recovered that"
1176,LVII,To join his regiment he felt him bound.
1177,LVII,"But would she not wish him one short ""Godspeed"","
1178,LVII,He asked no more.  Her greeting would suffice.
1179,LVII,He had resolved he never should return.
1180,LVII,Would she this sacrifice
1181,LVII,Make for a dying man?  How could she read
1182,LVII,"The rest!  But forcing her eyes to the deed,"
1183,LVII,She read.  Then dropped it in the fire to burn.
1184,LVII,
1185,LVII,
1186,LVIII,LVIII
1187,LVIII,
1188,LVIII,Gervase had set the river for their meeting
1189,LVIII,As farthest from the farms where Everard
1190,LVIII,Spent all his days.  How should he know such cheating
1191,LVIII,"Was quite expected, at least no dullard"
1192,LVIII,Was Everard Frampton.  Hours by hours he hid
1193,LVIII,"Among the willows watching.  Dusk had come,"
1194,LVIII,And from the Manor he had long been gone.
1195,LVIII,Eunice her burdensome
1196,LVIII,"Task set about.  Hooded and cloaked, she slid"
1197,LVIII,"Over the slippery paths, and soon amid"
1198,LVIII,The sallows saw a boat tied to a stone.
1199,LVIII,
1200,LVIII,
1201,LIX,LIX
1202,LIX,
1203,LIX,"Gervase arose, and kissed her hand, then pointed"
1204,LIX,"Into the boat.  She shook her head, but he"
1205,LIX,"Begged her to realize why, and with disjointed"
1206,LIX,Words told her of what peril there might be
1207,LIX,From listeners along the river bank.
1208,LIX,A push would take them out of earshot.  Ten
1209,LIX,"Minutes was all he asked, then she should land,"
1210,LIX,"He go away again,"
1211,LIX,Forever this time.  Yet how could he thank
1212,LIX,Her for so much compassion.  Here she sank
1213,LIX,"Upon a thwart, and bid him quick unstrand"
1214,LIX,
1215,LIX,
1216,LX,LX
1217,LX,
1218,LX,"His boat.  He cast the rope, and shoved the keel"
1219,LX,"Free of the gravel; jumped, and dropped beside"
1220,LX,"Her; took the oars, and they began to steal"
1221,LX,Under the overhanging trees.  A wide
1222,LX,Gash of red lantern-light cleft like a blade
1223,LX,"Into the gloom, and struck on Eunice sitting"
1224,LX,Rigid and stark upon the after thwart.
1225,LX,It blazed upon their flitting
1226,LX,"In merciless light.  A moment so it stayed,"
1227,LX,"Then was extinguished, and Sir Everard made"
1228,LX,"One leap, and landed just a fraction short."
1229,LX,
1230,LX,
1231,LXI,LXI
1232,LXI,
1233,LXI,His weight upon the gunwale tipped the boat
1234,LXI,To straining balance.  Everard lurched and seized
1235,LXI,His wife and held her smothered to his coat.
1236,LXI,"""Everard, loose me, we shall drown--"" and squeezed"
1237,LXI,"Against him, she beat with her hands.  He gasped"
1238,LXI,"""Never, by God!""  The slidden boat gave way"
1239,LXI,And the black foamy water split--and met.
1240,LXI,Bubbled up through the spray
1241,LXI,"A wailing rose and in the branches rasped,"
1242,LXI,"And creaked, and stilled.  Over the treetops, clasped"
1243,LXI,"In the blue evening, a clear moon was set."
1244,LXI,
1245,LXI,
1246,LXII,LXII
1247,LXII,
1248,LXII,"They lie entangled in the twisting roots,"
1249,LXII,Embraced forever.  Their cold marriage bed
1250,LXII,Close-canopied and curtained by the shoots
1251,LXII,"Of willows and pale birches.  At the head,"
1252,LXII,"White lilies, like still swans, placidly float"
1253,LXII,And sway above the pebbles.  Here are waves
1254,LXII,Sun-smitten for a threaded counterpane
1255,LXII,Gold-woven on their graves.
1256,LXII,"In perfect quietness they sleep, remote"
1257,LXII,"In the green, rippled twilight.  Death has smote"
1258,LXII,Them to perpetual oneness who were twain.

1269,LXII,Frau Concert-Meister Altgelt shut the door.
1270,LXII,"A storm was rising, heavy gusts of wind"
1271,LXII,"Swirled through the trees, and scattered leaves before"
1272,LXII,"Her on the clean, flagged path.  The sky behind"
1273,LXII,"The distant town was black, and sharp defined"
1274,LXII,"Against it shone the lines of roofs and towers,"
1275,LXII,Superimposed and flat like cardboard flowers.
1276,LXII,
1277,LXII,"A pasted city on a purple ground,"
1278,LXII,"Picked out with luminous paint, it seemed.  The cloud"
1279,LXII,"Split on an edge of lightning, and a sound"
1280,LXII,"Of rivers full and rushing boomed through bowed,"
1281,LXII,"Tossed, hissing branches.  Thunder rumbled loud"
1282,LXII,Beyond the town fast swallowing into gloom.
1283,LXII,Frau Altgelt closed the windows of each room.
1284,LXII,
1285,LXII,She bustled round to shake by constant moving
1286,LXII,"The strange, weird atmosphere.  She stirred the fire,"
1287,LXII,She twitched the supper-cloth as though improving
1288,LXII,"Its careful setting, then her own attire"
1289,LXII,"Came in for notice, tiptoeing higher and higher"
1290,LXII,"She peered into the wall-glass, now adjusting"
1291,LXII,"A straying lock, or else a ribbon thrusting"
1292,LXII,
1293,LXII,"This way or that to suit her.  At last sitting,"
1294,LXII,"Or rather plumping down upon a chair,"
1295,LXII,"She took her work, the stocking she was knitting,"
1296,LXII,And watched the rain upon the window glare
1297,LXII,"In white, bright drops.  Through the black glass a flare"
1298,LXII,"Of lightning squirmed about her needles.  ""Oh!"""
1299,LXII,"She cried.  ""What can be keeping Theodore so!"""
1300,LXII,
1301,LXII,A roll of thunder set the casements clapping.
1302,LXII,"Frau Altgelt flung her work aside and ran,"
1303,LXII,"Pulled open the house door, with kerchief flapping"
1304,LXII,She stood and gazed along the street.  A man
1305,LXII,Flung back the garden-gate and nearly ran
1306,LXII,"Her down as she stood in the door.  ""Why, Dear,"
1307,LXII,What in the name of patience brings you here?
1308,LXII,
1309,LXII,"Quick, Lotta, shut the door, my violin"
1310,LXII,"I fear is wetted.  Now, Dear, bring a light."
1311,LXII,This clasp is very much too worn and thin.
1312,LXII,I'll take the other fiddle out to-night
1313,LXII,"If it still rains.  Tut! Tut! my child, you're quite"
1314,LXII,"Clumsy.  Here, help me, hold the case while I--"
1315,LXII,"Give me the candle.  No, the inside's dry."
1316,LXII,
1317,LXII,"Thank God for that!  Well, Lotta, how are you?"
1318,LXII,"A bad storm, but the house still stands, I see."
1319,LXII,"Is my pipe filled, my Dear?  I'll have a few"
1320,LXII,Puffs and a snooze before I eat my tea.
1321,LXII,What do you say?  That you were feared for me?
1322,LXII,"Nonsense, my child.  Yes, kiss me, now don't talk."
1323,LXII,"I need a rest, the theatre's a long walk."""
1324,LXII,
1325,LXII,"Her needles still, her hands upon her lap"
1326,LXII,"Patiently laid, Charlotta Altgelt sat"
1327,LXII,And watched the rain-run window.  In his nap
1328,LXII,"Her husband stirred and muttered.  Seeing that,"
1329,LXII,"Charlotta rose and softly, pit-a-pat,"
1330,LXII,"Climbed up the stairs, and in her little room"
1331,LXII,Found sighing comfort with a moon in bloom.
1332,LXII,
1333,LXII,"But even rainy windows, silver-lit"
1334,LXII,"By a new-burst, storm-whetted moon, may give"
1335,LXII,"But poor content to loneliness, and it"
1336,LXII,Was hard for young Charlotta so to strive
1337,LXII,And down her eagerness and learn to live
1338,LXII,"In placid quiet.  While her husband slept,"
1339,LXII,Charlotta in her upper chamber wept.
1340,LXII,
1341,LXII,Herr Concert-Meister Altgelt was a man
1342,LXII,"Gentle and unambitious, that alone"
1343,LXII,"Had kept him back.  He played as few men can,"
1344,LXII,Drawing out of his instrument a tone
1345,LXII,"So shimmering-sweet and palpitant, it shone"
1346,LXII,"Like a bright thread of sound hung in the air,"
1347,LXII,"Afloat and swinging upward, slim and fair."
1348,LXII,
1349,LXII,"Above all things, above Charlotta his wife,"
1350,LXII,"Herr Altgelt loved his violin, a fine"
1351,LXII,"Cremona pattern, Stradivari's life"
1352,LXII,Was flowering out of early discipline
1353,LXII,When this was fashioned.  Of soft-cutting pine
1354,LXII,The belly was.  The back of broadly curled
1355,LXII,"Maple, the head made thick and sharply whirled."
1356,LXII,
1357,LXII,"The slanting, youthful sound-holes through"
1358,LXII,"The belly of fine, vigorous pine"
1359,LXII,Mellowed each note and blew
1360,LXII,It out again with a woody flavour
1361,LXII,Tanged and fragrant as fir-trees are
1362,LXII,When breezes in their needles jar.
1363,LXII,
1364,LXII,The varnish was an orange-brown
1365,LXII,Lustered like glass that's long laid down
1366,LXII,Under a crumbling villa stone.
1367,LXII,"Purfled stoutly, with mitres which point"
1368,LXII,Straight up the corners.  Each curve and joint
1369,LXII,"Clear, and bold, and thin."
1370,LXII,Such was Herr Theodore's violin.
1371,LXII,
1372,LXII,"Seven o'clock, the Concert-Meister gone"
1373,LXII,"With his best violin, the rain being stopped,"
1374,LXII,Frau Lotta in the kitchen sat alone
1375,LXII,Watching the embers which the fire dropped.
1376,LXII,"The china shone upon the dresser, topped"
1377,LXII,By polished copper vessels which her skill
1378,LXII,Kept brightly burnished.  It was very still.
1379,LXII,
1380,LXII,An air from 'Orfeo' hummed in her head.
1381,LXII,Herr Altgelt had been practising before
1382,LXII,The night's performance.  Charlotta had plead
1383,LXII,With him to stay with her.  Even at the door
1384,LXII,"She'd begged him not to go.  ""I do implore"
1385,LXII,"You for this evening, Theodore,"" she had said."
1386,LXII,"""Leave them to-night, and stay with me instead."""
1387,LXII,
1388,LXII,"""A silly poppet!""  Theodore pinched her ear."
1389,LXII,"""You'd like to have our good Elector turn"
1390,LXII,"Me out I think.""  ""But, Theodore, something queer"
1391,LXII,"Ails me.  Oh, do but notice how they burn,"
1392,LXII,"My cheeks!  The thunder worried me.  You're stern,"
1393,LXII,"And cold, and only love your work, I know."
1394,LXII,"But Theodore, for this evening, do not go."""
1395,LXII,
1396,LXII,"But he had gone, hurriedly at the end,"
1397,LXII,For she had kept him talking.  Now she sat
1398,LXII,"Alone again, always alone, the trend"
1399,LXII,Of all her thinking brought her back to that
1400,LXII,She wished to banish.  What would life be?  What?
1401,LXII,"For she was young, and loved, while he was moved"
1402,LXII,Only by music.  Each day that was proved.
1403,LXII,
1404,LXII,"Each day he rose and practised.  While he played,"
1405,LXII,"She stopped her work and listened, and her heart"
1406,LXII,Swelled painfully beneath her bodice.  Swayed
1407,LXII,"And longing, she would hide from him her smart."
1408,LXII,"""Well, Lottchen, will that do?""  Then what a start"
1409,LXII,"She gave, and she would run to him and cry,"
1410,LXII,"And he would gently chide her, ""Fie, Dear, fie."
1411,LXII,
1412,LXII,I'm glad I played it well.  But such a taking!
1413,LXII,"You'll hear the thing enough before I've done."""
1414,LXII,"And she would draw away from him, still shaking."
1415,LXII,"Had he but guessed she was another one,"
1416,LXII,"Another violin.  Her strings were aching,"
1417,LXII,"Stretched to the touch of his bow hand, again"
1418,LXII,He played and she almost broke at the strain.
1419,LXII,
1420,LXII,"Where was the use of thinking of it now,"
1421,LXII,Sitting alone and listening to the clock!
1422,LXII,She'd best make haste and knit another row.
1423,LXII,Three hours at least must pass before his knock
1424,LXII,Would startle her.  It always was a shock.
1425,LXII,"She listened--listened--for so long before,"
1426,LXII,That when it came her hearing almost tore.
1427,LXII,
1428,LXII,She caught herself just starting in to listen.
1429,LXII,What nerves she had:  rattling like brittle sticks!
1430,LXII,"She wandered to the window, for the glisten"
1431,LXII,Of a bright moon was tempting.  Snuffed the wicks
1432,LXII,Of her two candles.  Still she could not fix
1433,LXII,To anything.  The moon in a broad swath
1434,LXII,Beckoned her out and down the garden-path.
1435,LXII,
1436,LXII,"Against the house, her hollyhocks stood high"
1437,LXII,"And black, their shadows doubling them.  The night"
1438,LXII,"Was white and still with moonlight, and a sigh"
1439,LXII,"Of blowing leaves was there, and the dim flight"
1440,LXII,"Of insects, and the smell of aconite,"
1441,LXII,"And stocks, and Marvel of Peru.  She flitted"
1442,LXII,"Along the path, where blocks of shadow pitted"
1443,LXII,
1444,LXII,The even flags.  She let herself go dreaming
1445,LXII,"Of Theodore her husband, and the tune"
1446,LXII,"From 'Orfeo' swam through her mind, but seeming"
1447,LXII,"Changed--shriller.  Of a sudden, the clear moon"
1448,LXII,"Showed her a passer-by, inopportune"
1449,LXII,"Indeed, but here he was, whistling and striding."
1450,LXII,"Lotta squeezed in between the currants, hiding."
1451,LXII,
1452,LXII,"""The best laid plans of mice and men,"" alas!"
1453,LXII,"The stranger came indeed, but did not pass."
1454,LXII,"Instead, he leant upon the garden-gate,"
1455,LXII,"Folding his arms and whistling.  Lotta's state,"
1456,LXII,"Crouched in the prickly currants, on wet grass,"
1457,LXII,"Was far from pleasant.  Still the stranger stayed,"
1458,LXII,"And Lotta in her currants watched, dismayed."
1459,LXII,
1460,LXII,He seemed a proper fellow standing there
1461,LXII,In the bright moonshine.  His cocked hat was laced
1462,LXII,"With silver, and he wore his own brown hair"
1463,LXII,"Tied, but unpowdered.  His whole bearing graced"
1464,LXII,"A fine cloth coat, and ruffled shirt, and chased"
1465,LXII,"Sword-hilt.  Charlotta looked, but her position"
1466,LXII,Was hardly easy.  When would his volition
1467,LXII,
1468,LXII,Suggest his walking on?  And then that tune!
1469,LXII,A half-a-dozen bars from 'Orfeo'
1470,LXII,"Gone over and over, and murdered.  What Fortune"
1471,LXII,Had brought him there to stare about him so?
1472,LXII,"""Ach, Gott im Himmel!  Why will he not go!"""
1473,LXII,"Thought Lotta, but the young man whistled on,"
1474,LXII,And seemed in no great hurry to be gone.
1475,LXII,
1476,LXII,"Charlotta, crouched among the currant bushes,"
1477,LXII,Watched the moon slowly dip from twig to twig.
1478,LXII,"If Theodore should chance to come, and blushes"
1479,LXII,"Streamed over her.  He would not care a fig,"
1480,LXII,He'd only laugh.  She pushed aside a sprig
1481,LXII,"Of sharp-edged leaves and peered, then she uprose"
1482,LXII,"Amid her bushes.  ""Sir,"" said she, ""pray whose"
1483,LXII,
1484,LXII,Garden do you suppose you're watching?  Why
1485,LXII,Do you stand there?  I really must insist
1486,LXII,Upon your leaving.  'Tis unmannerly
1487,LXII,"To stay so long.""  The young man gave a twist"
1488,LXII,"And turned about, and in the amethyst"
1489,LXII,Moonlight he saw her like a nymph half-risen
1490,LXII,From the green bushes which had been her prison.
1491,LXII,
1492,LXII,He swept his hat off in a hurried bow.
1493,LXII,"""Your pardon, Madam, I had no idea"
1494,LXII,"I was not quite alone, and that is how"
1495,LXII,I came to stay.  My trespass was not sheer
1496,LXII,"Impertinence.  I thought no one was here,"
1497,LXII,And really gardens cry to be admired.
1498,LXII,To-night especially it seemed required.
1499,LXII,
1500,LXII,And may I beg to introduce myself?
1501,LXII,"Heinrich Marohl of Munich.  And your name?"""
1502,LXII,Charlotta told him.  And the artful elf
1503,LXII,Promptly exclaimed about her husband's fame.
1504,LXII,"So Lotta, half-unwilling, slowly came"
1505,LXII,To conversation with him.  When she went
1506,LXII,"Into the house, she found the evening spent."
1507,LXII,
1508,LXII,"Theodore arrived quite wearied out and teased,"
1509,LXII,With all excitement in him burned away.
1510,LXII,"It had gone well, he said, the audience pleased,"
1511,LXII,"And he had played his very best to-day,"
1512,LXII,But afterwards he had been forced to stay
1513,LXII,And practise with the stupid ones.  His head
1514,LXII,"Ached furiously, and he must get to bed."
1515,LXII,
1516,LXII,
1517,LXII,Part Second
1518,LXII,
1519,LXII,"Herr Concert-Meister Altgelt played,"
1520,LXII,And the four strings of his violin
1521,LXII,Were spinning like bees on a day in Spring.
1522,LXII,The notes rose into the wide sun-mote
1523,LXII,"Which slanted through the window,"
1524,LXII,"They lay like coloured beads a-row,"
1525,LXII,"They knocked together and parted,"
1526,LXII,"And started to dance,"
1527,LXII,"Skipping, tripping, each one slipping"
1528,LXII,Under and over the others so
1529,LXII,That the polychrome fire streamed like a lance
1530,LXII,"Or a comet's tail,"
1531,LXII,Behind them.
1532,LXII,Then a wail arose--crescendo--
1533,LXII,"And dropped from off the end of the bow,"
1534,LXII,And the dancing stopped.
1535,LXII,"A scent of lilies filled the room,"
1536,LXII,Long and slow.  Each large white bloom
1537,LXII,"Breathed a sound which was holy perfume from a blessed censer,"
1538,LXII,"And the hum of an organ tone,"
1539,LXII,And they waved like fans in a hall of stone
1540,LXII,"Over a bier standing there in the centre, alone."
1541,LXII,Each lily bent slowly as it was blown.
1542,LXII,Like smoke they rose from the violin--
1543,LXII,Then faded as a swifter bowing
1544,LXII,Jumbled the notes like wavelets flowing
1545,LXII,"In a splashing, pashing, rippling motion"
1546,LXII,Between broad meadows to an ocean
1547,LXII,"Wide as a day and blue as a flower,"
1548,LXII,Where every hour
1549,LXII,"Gulls dipped, and scattered, and squawked, and squealed,"
1550,LXII,"And over the marshes the Angelus pealed,"
1551,LXII,And the prows of the fishing-boats were spattered
1552,LXII,With spray.
1553,LXII,And away a couple of frigates were starting
1554,LXII,"To race to Java with all sails set,"
1555,LXII,"Topgallants, and royals, and stunsails, and jibs,"
1556,LXII,And wide moonsails; and the shining rails
1557,LXII,Were polished so bright they sparked in the sun.
1558,LXII,All the sails went up with a run:
1559,LXII,"""They call me Hanging Johnny,"
1560,LXII,Away-i-oh;
1561,LXII,"They call me Hanging Johnny,"
1562,LXII,"So hang, boys, hang."""
1563,LXII,"And the sun had set and the high moon whitened,"
1564,LXII,And the ship heeled over to the breeze.
1565,LXII,"He drew her into the shade of the sails,"
1566,LXII,And whispered tales
1567,LXII,"Of voyages in the China seas,"
1568,LXII,And his arm around her
1569,LXII,Held and bound her.
1570,LXII,"She almost swooned,"
1571,LXII,With the breeze and the moon
1572,LXII,"And the slipping sea,"
1573,LXII,"And he beside her,"
1574,LXII,"Touching her, leaning--"
1575,LXII,"The ship careening,"
1576,LXII,With the white moon steadily shining over
1577,LXII,"Her and her lover,"
1578,LXII,"Theodore, still her lover!"
1579,LXII,
1580,LXII,"Then a quiver fell on the crowded notes,"
1581,LXII,And slowly floated
1582,LXII,A single note which spread and spread
1583,LXII,"Till it filled the room with a shimmer like gold,"
1584,LXII,"And noises shivered throughout its length,"
1585,LXII,And tried its strength.
1586,LXII,"They pulled it, and tore it,"
1587,LXII,"And the stuff waned thinner, but still it bore it."
1588,LXII,Then a wide rent
1589,LXII,"Split the arching tent,"
1590,LXII,"And balls of fire spurted through,"
1591,LXII,"Spitting yellow, and mauve, and blue."
1592,LXII,"One by one they were quenched as they fell,"
1593,LXII,Only the blue burned steadily.
1594,LXII,"Paler and paler it grew, and--faded--away."
1595,LXII,Herr Altgelt stopped.
1596,LXII,
1597,LXII,"""Well, Lottachen, my Dear, what do you say?"
1598,LXII,I think I'm in good trim.  Now let's have dinner.
1599,LXII,"What's this, my Love, you're very sweet to-day."
1600,LXII,I wonder how it happens I'm the winner
1601,LXII,Of so much sweetness.  But I think you're thinner;
1602,LXII,You're like a bag of feathers on my knee.
1603,LXII,"Why, Lotta child, you're almost strangling me."
1604,LXII,
1605,LXII,I'm glad you're going out this afternoon.
1606,LXII,"The days are getting short, and I'm so tied"
1607,LXII,At the Court Theatre my poor little bride
1608,LXII,"Has not much junketing I fear, but soon"
1609,LXII,I'll ask our manager to grant a boon.
1610,LXII,"To-night, perhaps, I'll get a pass for you,"
1611,LXII,"And when I go, why Lotta can come too."
1612,LXII,
1613,LXII,"Now dinner, Love.  I want some onion soup"
1614,LXII,To whip me up till that rehearsal's over.
1615,LXII,You know it's odd how some women can stoop!
1616,LXII,"Fraeulein Gebnitz has taken on a lover,"
1617,LXII,A Jew named Goldstein.  No one can discover
1618,LXII,If it's his money.  But she lives alone
1619,LXII,"Practically.  Gebnitz is a stone,"
1620,LXII,
1621,LXII,"Pores over books all day, and has no ear"
1622,LXII,For his wife's singing.  Artists must have men;
1623,LXII,They need appreciation.  But it's queer
1624,LXII,"What messes people make of their lives, when"
1625,LXII,"They should know more.  If Gebnitz finds out, then"
1626,LXII,"His wife will pack.  Yes, shut the door at once."
1627,LXII,"I did not feel it cold, I am a dunce."""
1628,LXII,
1629,LXII,Frau Altgelt tied her bonnet on and went
1630,LXII,"Into the streets.  A bright, crisp Autumn wind"
1631,LXII,"Flirted her skirts and hair.  A turbulent,"
1632,LXII,"Audacious wind it was, now close behind,"
1633,LXII,Pushing her bonnet forward till it twined
1634,LXII,"The strings across her face, then from in front"
1635,LXII,"Slantingly swinging at her with a shunt,"
1636,LXII,
1637,LXII,"Until she lay against it, struggling, pushing,"
1638,LXII,Dismayed to find her clothing tightly bound
1639,LXII,"Around her, every fold and wrinkle crushing"
1640,LXII,"Itself upon her, so that she was wound"
1641,LXII,In draperies as clinging as those found
1642,LXII,Sucking about a sea nymph on the frieze
1643,LXII,Of some old Grecian temple.  In the breeze
1644,LXII,
1645,LXII,The shops and houses had a quality
1646,LXII,Of hard and dazzling colour; something sharp
1647,LXII,"And buoyant, like white, puffing sails at sea."
1648,LXII,The city streets were twanging like a harp.
1649,LXII,"Charlotta caught the movement, skippingly"
1650,LXII,"She blew along the pavement, hardly knowing"
1651,LXII,Toward what destination she was going.
1652,LXII,
1653,LXII,"She fetched up opposite a jeweller's shop,"
1654,LXII,"Where filigreed tiaras shone like crowns,"
1655,LXII,And necklaces of emeralds seemed to drop
1656,LXII,And then float up again with lightness.  Browns
1657,LXII,Of striped agates struck her like cold frowns
1658,LXII,"Amid the gaiety of topaz seals,"
1659,LXII,"Carved though they were with heads, and arms, and wheels."
1660,LXII,
1661,LXII,A row of pencils knobbed with quartz or sard
1662,LXII,Delighted her.  And rings of every size
1663,LXII,"Turned smartly round like hoops before her eyes,"
1664,LXII,"Amethyst-flamed or ruby-girdled, jarred"
1665,LXII,"To spokes and flashing triangles, and starred"
1666,LXII,Like rockets bursting on a festal day.
1667,LXII,Charlotta could not tear herself away.
1668,LXII,
1669,LXII,"With eyes glued tightly on a golden box,"
1670,LXII,"Whose rare enamel piqued her with its hue,"
1671,LXII,"Changeable, iridescent, shuttlecocks"
1672,LXII,Of shades and lustres always darting through
1673,LXII,"Its level, superimposing sheet of blue,"
1674,LXII,Charlotta did not hear footsteps approaching.
1675,LXII,"She started at the words:  ""Am I encroaching?"""
1676,LXII,
1677,LXII,"""Oh, Heinrich, how you frightened me!  I thought"
1678,LXII,"We were to meet at three, is it quite that?"""
1679,LXII,"""No, it is not,"" he answered, ""but I've caught"
1680,LXII,"The trick of missing you.  One thing is flat,"
1681,LXII,I cannot go on this way.  Life is what
1682,LXII,Might best be conjured up by the word:  'Hell'.
1683,LXII,"Dearest, when will you come?""  Lotta, to quell"
1684,LXII,
1685,LXII,"His effervescence, pointed to the gems"
1686,LXII,"Within the window, asked him to admire"
1687,LXII,A bracelet or a buckle.  But one stems
1688,LXII,Uneasily the burning of a fire.
1689,LXII,"Heinrich was chafing, pricked by his desire."
1690,LXII,Little by little she wooed him to her mood
1691,LXII,Until at last he promised to be good.
1692,LXII,
1693,LXII,But here he started on another tack;
1694,LXII,"To buy a jewel, which one would Lotta choose."
1695,LXII,She vainly urged against him all her lack
1696,LXII,Of other trinkets.  Should she dare to use
1697,LXII,A ring or brooch her husband might accuse
1698,LXII,"Her of extravagance, and ask to see"
1699,LXII,"A strict accounting, or still worse might be."
1700,LXII,
1701,LXII,But Heinrich would not be persuaded.  Why
1702,LXII,Should he not give her what he liked?  And in
1703,LXII,"He went, determined certainly to buy"
1704,LXII,A thing so beautiful that it would win
1705,LXII,Her wavering fancy.  Altgelt's violin
1706,LXII,He would outscore by such a handsome jewel
1707,LXII,That Lotta could no longer be so cruel!
1708,LXII,
1709,LXII,"Pity Charlotta, torn in diverse ways."
1710,LXII,"If she went in with him, the shopman might"
1711,LXII,"Recognize her, give her her name; in days"
1712,LXII,To come he could denounce her.  In her fright
1713,LXII,She almost fled.  But Heinrich would be quite
1714,LXII,Capable of pursuing.  By and by
1715,LXII,She pushed the door and entered hurriedly.
1716,LXII,
1717,LXII,It took some pains to keep him from bestowing
1718,LXII,"A pair of ruby earrings, carved like roses,"
1719,LXII,The setting twined to represent the growing
1720,LXII,"Tendrils and leaves, upon her.  ""Who supposes"
1721,LXII,I could obtain such things!  It simply closes
1722,LXII,"All comfort for me.""  So he changed his mind"
1723,LXII,And bought as slight a gift as he could find.
1724,LXII,
1725,LXII,"A locket, frosted over with seed pearls,"
1726,LXII,"Oblong and slim, for wearing at the neck,"
1727,LXII,Or hidden in the bosom; their joined curls
1728,LXII,Should lie in it.  And further to bedeck
1729,LXII,"His love, Heinrich had picked a whiff, a fleck,"
1730,LXII,"The merest puff of a thin, linked chain"
1731,LXII,To hang it from.  Lotta could not refrain
1732,LXII,
1733,LXII,From weeping as they sauntered down the street.
1734,LXII,"She did not want the locket, yet she did."
1735,LXII,"To have him love her she found very sweet,"
1736,LXII,But it is hard to keep love always hid.
1737,LXII,Then there was something in her heart which chid
1738,LXII,"Her, told her she loved Theodore in him,"
1739,LXII,That all these meetings were a foolish whim.
1740,LXII,
1741,LXII,"She thought of Theodore and the life they led,"
1742,LXII,"So near together, but so little mingled."
1743,LXII,"The great clouds bulged and bellied overhead,"
1744,LXII,And the fresh wind about her body tingled;
1745,LXII,The crane of a large warehouse creaked and jingled;
1746,LXII,"Charlotta held her breath for very fear,"
1747,LXII,About her in the street she seemed to hear:
1748,LXII,"""They call me Hanging Johnny,"
1749,LXII,Away-i-oh;
1750,LXII,"They call me Hanging Johnny,"
1751,LXII,"So hang, boys, hang."""
1752,LXII,
1753,LXII,"And it was Theodore, under the racing skies,"
1754,LXII,Who held her and who whispered in her ear.
1755,LXII,"She knew her heart was telling her no lies,"
1756,LXII,"Beating and hammering.  He was so dear,"
1757,LXII,The touch of him would send her in a queer
1758,LXII,Swoon that was half an ecstasy.  And yearning
1759,LXII,"For Theodore, she wandered, slowly turning"
1760,LXII,
1761,LXII,Street after street as Heinrich wished it so.
1762,LXII,"He had some aim, she had forgotten what."
1763,LXII,"Their progress was confused and very slow,"
1764,LXII,"But at the last they reached a lonely spot,"
1765,LXII,A garden far above the highest shot
1766,LXII,"Of soaring steeple.  At their feet, the town"
1767,LXII,Spread open like a chequer-board laid down.
1768,LXII,
1769,LXII,"Lotta was dimly conscious of the rest,"
1770,LXII,Vaguely remembered how he clasped the chain
1771,LXII,"About her neck.  She treated it in jest,"
1772,LXII,And saw his face cloud over with sharp pain.
1773,LXII,Then suddenly she felt as though a strain
1774,LXII,"Were put upon her, collared like a slave,"
1775,LXII,Leashed in the meshes of this thing he gave.
1776,LXII,
1777,LXII,She seized the flimsy rings with both her hands
1778,LXII,"To snap it, but they held with odd persistence."
1779,LXII,Her eyes were blinded by two wind-blown strands
1780,LXII,Of hair which had been loosened.  Her resistance
1781,LXII,"Melted within her, from remotest distance,"
1782,LXII,"Misty, unreal, his face grew warm and near,"
1783,LXII,And giving way she knew him very dear.
1784,LXII,
1785,LXII,"For long he held her, and they both gazed down"
1786,LXII,"At the wide city, and its blue, bridged river."
1787,LXII,"From wooing he jested with her, snipped the blown"
1788,LXII,"Strands of her hair, and tied them with a sliver"
1789,LXII,Cut from his own head.  But she gave a shiver
1790,LXII,"When, opening the locket, they were placed"
1791,LXII,"Under the glass, commingled and enlaced."
1792,LXII,
1793,LXII,"""When will you have it so with us?""  He sighed."
1794,LXII,"She shook her head.  He pressed her further.  ""No,"
1795,LXII,"No, Heinrich, Theodore loves me,"" and she tried"
1796,LXII,"To free herself and rise.  He held her so,"
1797,LXII,"Clipped by his arms, she could not move nor go."
1798,LXII,"""But you love me,"" he whispered, with his face"
1799,LXII,Burning against her through her kerchief's lace.
1800,LXII,
1801,LXII,"Frau Altgelt knew she toyed with fire, knew"
1802,LXII,That what her husband lit this other man
1803,LXII,Fanned to hot flame.  She told herself that few
1804,LXII,"Women were so discreet as she, who ran"
1805,LXII,No danger since she knew what things to ban.
1806,LXII,"She opened her house door at five o'clock,"
1807,LXII,A short half-hour before her husband's knock.
1808,LXII,
1809,LXII,
1810,LXII,Part Third
1811,LXII,
1812,LXII,The 'Residenz-Theater' sparked and hummed
1813,LXII,"With lights and people.  Gebnitz was to sing,"
1814,LXII,That rare soprano.  All the fiddles strummed
1815,LXII,With tuning up; the wood-winds made a ring
1816,LXII,"Of reedy bubbling noises, and the sting"
1817,LXII,"Of sharp, red brass pierced every ear-drum; patting"
1818,LXII,From muffled tympani made a dark slatting
1819,LXII,
1820,LXII,Across the silver shimmering of flutes;
1821,LXII,"A bassoon grunted, and an oboe wailed;"
1822,LXII,"The 'celli pizzicato-ed like great lutes,"
1823,LXII,And mutterings of double basses trailed
1824,LXII,"Away to silence, while loud harp-strings hailed"
1825,LXII,"Their thin, bright colours down in such a scatter"
1826,LXII,They lost themselves amid the general clatter.
1827,LXII,
1828,LXII,"Frau Altgelt in the gallery, alone,"
1829,LXII,Felt lifted up into another world.
1830,LXII,Before her eyes a thousand candles shone
1831,LXII,In the great chandeliers.  A maze of curled
1832,LXII,And powdered periwigs past her eyes swirled.
1833,LXII,"She smelt the smoke of candles guttering,"
1834,LXII,And caught the glint of jewelled fans fluttering
1835,LXII,
1836,LXII,"All round her in the boxes.  Red and gold,"
1837,LXII,"The house, like rubies set in filigree,"
1838,LXII,"Filliped the candlelight about, and bold"
1839,LXII,"Young sparks with eye-glasses, unblushingly"
1840,LXII,Ogled fair beauties in the balcony.
1841,LXII,"An officer went by, his steel spurs jangling."
1842,LXII,Behind Charlotta an old man was wrangling
1843,LXII,
1844,LXII,About a play-bill he had bought and lost.
1845,LXII,Three drunken soldiers had to be ejected.
1846,LXII,Frau Altgelt's eyes stared at the vacant post
1847,LXII,"Of Concert-Meister, she at once detected"
1848,LXII,The stir which brought him.  But she felt neglected
1849,LXII,"When with no glance about him or her way,"
1850,LXII,He lifted up his violin to play.
1851,LXII,
1852,LXII,"The curtain went up?  Perhaps.  If so,"
1853,LXII,Charlotta never saw it go.
1854,LXII,The famous Fraeulein Gebnitz' singing
1855,LXII,Only came to her like the ringing
1856,LXII,Of bells at a festa
1857,LXII,Which swing in the air
1858,LXII,And nobody realizes they are there.
1859,LXII,"They jingle and jangle,"
1860,LXII,"And clang, and bang,"
1861,LXII,"And never a soul could tell whether they rang,"
1862,LXII,For the plopping of guns and rockets
1863,LXII,"And the chinking of silver to spend, in one's pockets,"
1864,LXII,"And the shuffling and clapping of feet,"
1865,LXII,And the loud flapping
1866,LXII,"Of flags, with the drums,"
1867,LXII,As the military comes.
1868,LXII,"It's a famous tune to walk to,"
1869,LXII,And I wonder where they're off to.
1870,LXII,Step-step-stepping to the beating of the drums.
1871,LXII,But the rhythm changes as though a mist
1872,LXII,Were curling and twisting
1873,LXII,Over the landscape.
1874,LXII,"For a moment a rhythmless, tuneless fog"
1875,LXII,Encompasses her.  Then her senses jog
1876,LXII,To the breath of a stately minuet.
1877,LXII,Herr Altgelt's violin is set
1878,LXII,"In tune to the slow, sweeping bows, and retreats and advances,"
1879,LXII,To curtsies brushing the waxen floor as the Court dances.
1880,LXII,Long and peaceful like warm Summer nights
1881,LXII,When stars shine in the quiet river.  And against the lights
1882,LXII,"Blundering insects knock,"
1883,LXII,And the 'Rathaus' clock
1884,LXII,"Booms twice, through the shrill sounds"
1885,LXII,Of flutes and horns in the lamplit grounds.
1886,LXII,Pressed against him in the mazy wavering
1887,LXII,"Of a country dance, with her short breath quavering"
1888,LXII,"She leans upon the beating, throbbing"
1889,LXII,"Music.  Laughing, sobbing,"
1890,LXII,Feet gliding after sliding feet;
1891,LXII,His--hers--
1892,LXII,The ballroom blurs--
1893,LXII,She feels the air
1894,LXII,"Lifting her hair,"
1895,LXII,And the lapping of water on the stone stair.
1896,LXII,He is there!  He is there!
1897,LXII,"Twang harps, and squeal, you thin violins,"
1898,LXII,"That the dancers may dance, and never discover"
1899,LXII,The old stone stair leading down to the river
1900,LXII,With the chestnut-tree branches hanging over
1901,LXII,Her and her lover.
1902,LXII,"Theodore, still her lover!"
1903,LXII,
1904,LXII,"The evening passed like this, in a half faint,"
1905,LXII,Delirium with waking intervals
1906,LXII,Which were the entr'acts.  Under the restraint
1907,LXII,"Of a large company, the constant calls"
1908,LXII,For oranges or syrops from the stalls
1909,LXII,"Outside, the talk, the passing to and fro,"
1910,LXII,"Lotta sat ill at ease, incognito."
1911,LXII,
1912,LXII,"She heard the Gebnitz praised, the tenor lauded,"
1913,LXII,The music vaunted as most excellent.
1914,LXII,"The scenery and the costumes were applauded,"
1915,LXII,The latter it was whispered had been sent
1916,LXII,From Italy.  The Herr Direktor spent
1917,LXII,"A fortune on them, so the gossips said."
1918,LXII,Charlotta felt a lightness in her head.
1919,LXII,
1920,LXII,"When the next act began, her eyes were swimming,"
1921,LXII,Her prodded ears were aching and confused.
1922,LXII,The first notes from the orchestra sent skimming
1923,LXII,Her outward consciousness.  Her brain was fused
1924,LXII,"Into the music, Theodore's music!  Used"
1925,LXII,"To hear him play, she caught his single tone."
1926,LXII,For all she noticed they two were alone.
1927,LXII,
1928,LXII,
1929,LXII,Part Fourth
1930,LXII,
1931,LXII,"Frau Altgelt waited in the chilly street,"
1932,LXII,Hustled by lackeys who ran up and down
1933,LXII,Shouting their coachmen's names; forced to retreat
1934,LXII,A pace or two by lurching chairmen; thrown
1935,LXII,Rudely aside by linkboys; boldly shown
1936,LXII,The ogling rapture in two bleary eyes
1937,LXII,Thrust close to hers in most unpleasant wise.
1938,LXII,
1939,LXII,"Escaping these, she hit a liveried arm,"
1940,LXII,Was sworn at by this glittering gentleman
1941,LXII,"And ordered off.  However, no great harm"
1942,LXII,Came to her.  But she looked a trifle wan
1943,LXII,"When Theodore, her belated guardian,"
1944,LXII,"Emerged.  She snuggled up against him, trembling,"
1945,LXII,"Half out of fear, half out of the assembling"
1946,LXII,
1947,LXII,Of all the thoughts and needs his playing had given.
1948,LXII,"Had she enjoyed herself, he wished to know."
1949,LXII,"""Oh! Theodore, can't you feel that it was Heaven!"""
1950,LXII,"""Heaven!  My Lottachen, and was it so?"
1951,LXII,"Gebnitz was in good voice, but all the flow"
1952,LXII,"Of her last aria was spoiled by Klops,"
1953,LXII,"A wretched flutist, she was mad as hops."""
1954,LXII,
1955,LXII,"He was so simple, so matter-of-fact,"
1956,LXII,Charlotta Altgelt knew not what to say
1957,LXII,To bring him to her dream.  His lack of tact
1958,LXII,Kept him explaining all the homeward way
1959,LXII,"How this thing had gone well, that badly.  ""Stay,"
1960,LXII,"Theodore!"" she cried at last.  ""You know to me"
1961,LXII,"Nothing was real, it was an ecstasy."""
1962,LXII,
1963,LXII,And he was heartily glad she had enjoyed
1964,LXII,"Herself so much, and said so.  ""But it's good"
1965,LXII,"To be got home again.""  He was employed"
1966,LXII,"In looking at his violin, the wood"
1967,LXII,"Was old, and evening air did it no good."
1968,LXII,But when he drew up to the table for tea
1969,LXII,Something about his wife's vivacity
1970,LXII,
1971,LXII,"Struck him as hectic, worried him in short."
1972,LXII,He talked of this and that but watched her close.
1973,LXII,"Tea over, he endeavoured to extort"
1974,LXII,The cause of her excitement.  She arose
1975,LXII,"And stood beside him, trying to compose"
1976,LXII,"Herself, all whipt to quivering, curdled life,"
1977,LXII,"And he, poor fool, misunderstood his wife."
1978,LXII,
1979,LXII,"Suddenly, broken through her anxious grasp,"
1980,LXII,Her music-kindled love crashed on him there.
1981,LXII,"Amazed, he felt her fling against him, clasp"
1982,LXII,"Her arms about him, weighing down his chair,"
1983,LXII,Sobbing out all her hours of despair.
1984,LXII,"""Theodore, a woman needs to hear things proved."
1985,LXII,"Unless you tell me, I feel I'm not loved."""
1986,LXII,
1987,LXII,"Theodore went under in this tearing wave,"
1988,LXII,"He yielded to it, and its headlong flow"
1989,LXII,Filled him with all the energy she gave.
1990,LXII,"He was a youth again, and this bright glow,"
1991,LXII,"This living, vivid joy he had to show"
1992,LXII,"Her what she was to him.  Laughing and crying,"
1993,LXII,She asked assurances there's no denying.
1994,LXII,
1995,LXII,"Over and over again her questions, till"
1996,LXII,"He quite convinced her, every now and then"
1997,LXII,"She kissed him, shivering as though doubting still."
1998,LXII,But later when they were composed and when
1999,LXII,"She dared relax her probings, ""Lottachen,"""
2000,LXII,"He asked, ""how is it your love has withstood"
2001,LXII,"My inadvertence?  I was made of wood."""
2002,LXII,
2003,LXII,"She told him, and no doubt she meant it truly,"
2004,LXII,"That he was sun, and grass, and wind, and sky"
2005,LXII,To her.  And even if conscience were unruly
2006,LXII,"She salved it by neat sophistries, but why"
2007,LXII,"Suppose her insincere, it was no lie"
2008,LXII,"She said, for Heinrich was as much forgot"
2009,LXII,As though he'd never been within earshot.
2010,LXII,
2011,LXII,But Theodore's hands in straying and caressing
2012,LXII,Fumbled against the locket where it lay
2013,LXII,"Upon her neck.  ""What is this thing I'm pressing?"""
2014,LXII,"He asked.  ""Let's bring it to the light of day."""
2015,LXII,"He lifted up the locket.  ""It should stay"
2016,LXII,"Outside, my Dear.  Your mother has good taste."
2017,LXII,"To keep it hidden surely is a waste."""
2018,LXII,
2019,LXII,"Pity again Charlotta, straight aroused"
2020,LXII,Out of her happiness.  The locket brought
2021,LXII,"A chilly jet of truth upon her, soused"
2022,LXII,"Under its icy spurting she was caught,"
2023,LXII,"And choked, and frozen.  Suddenly she sought"
2024,LXII,"The clasp, but with such art was this contrived"
2025,LXII,Her fumbling fingers never once arrived
2026,LXII,
2027,LXII,"Upon it.  Feeling, twisting, round and round,"
2028,LXII,She pulled the chain quite through the locket's ring
2029,LXII,"And still it held.  Her neck, encompassed, bound,"
2030,LXII,Chafed at the sliding meshes.  Such a thing
2031,LXII,To hurl her out of joy!  A gilded string
2032,LXII,"Binding her folly to her, and those curls"
2033,LXII,Which lay entwined beneath the clustered pearls!
2034,LXII,
2035,LXII,Again she tried to break the cord.  It stood.
2036,LXII,"""Unclasp it, Theodore,"" she begged.  But he"
2037,LXII,"Refused, and being in a happy mood,"
2038,LXII,"Twitted her with her inefficiency,"
2039,LXII,Then looking at her very seriously:
2040,LXII,"""I think, Charlotta, it is well to have"
2041,LXII,Always about one what a mother gave.
2042,LXII,
2043,LXII,As she has taken the great pains to send
2044,LXII,"This jewel to you from Dresden, it will be"
2045,LXII,Ingratitude if you do not intend
2046,LXII,To carry it about you constantly.
2047,LXII,"With her fine taste you cannot disagree,"
2048,LXII,"The locket is most beautifully designed."""
2049,LXII,"He opened it and there the curls were, twined."
2050,LXII,
2051,LXII,Charlotta's heart dropped beats like knitting-stitches.
2052,LXII,"She burned a moment, flaming; then she froze."
2053,LXII,"Her face was jerked by little, nervous twitches,"
2054,LXII,"She heard her husband asking:  ""What are those?"""
2055,LXII,"Put out her hand quickly to interpose,"
2056,LXII,"But stopped, the gesture half-complete, astounded"
2057,LXII,At the calm way the question was propounded.
2058,LXII,
2059,LXII,"""A pretty fancy, Dear, I do declare."
2060,LXII,Indeed I will not let you put it off.
2061,LXII,"A lovely thought:  yours and your mother's hair!"""
2062,LXII,Charlotta hid a gasp under a cough.
2063,LXII,"""Never with my connivance shall you doff"
2064,LXII,"This charming gift.""  He kissed her on the cheek,"
2065,LXII,"And Lotta suffered him, quite crushed and meek."
2066,LXII,
2067,LXII,"When later in their room she lay awake,"
2068,LXII,"Watching the moonlight slip along the floor,"
2069,LXII,She felt the chain and wept for Theodore's sake.
2070,LXII,"She had loved Heinrich also, and the core"
2071,LXII,"Of truth, unlovely, startled her.  Wherefore"
2072,LXII,She vowed from now to break this double life
2073,LXII,And see herself only as Theodore's wife.
2074,LXII,
2075,LXII,
2076,LXII,Part Fifth
2077,LXII,
2078,LXII,It was no easy matter to convince
2079,LXII,Heinrich that it was finished.  Hard to say
2080,LXII,That though they could not meet (he saw her wince)
2081,LXII,She still must keep the locket to allay
2082,LXII,Suspicion in her husband.  She would pay
2083,LXII,Him from her savings bit by bit--the oath
2084,LXII,He swore at that was startling to them both.
2085,LXII,
2086,LXII,"Her resolution taken, Frau Altgelt"
2087,LXII,"Adhered to it, and suffered no regret."
2088,LXII,She found her husband all that she had felt
2089,LXII,His music to contain.  Her days were set
2090,LXII,In his as though she were an amulet
2091,LXII,Cased in bright gold.  She joyed in her confining;
2092,LXII,Her eyes put out her looking-glass with shining.
2093,LXII,
2094,LXII,"Charlotta was so gay that old, dull tasks"
2095,LXII,Were furbished up to seem like rituals.
2096,LXII,She baked and brewed as one who only asks
2097,LXII,The right to serve.  Her daily manuals
2098,LXII,"Of prayer were duties, and her festivals"
2099,LXII,"When Theodore praised some dish, or frankly said"
2100,LXII,She had a knack in making up a bed.
2101,LXII,
2102,LXII,"So Autumn went, and all the mountains round"
2103,LXII,"The city glittered white with fallen snow,"
2104,LXII,For it was Winter.  Over the hard ground
2105,LXII,"Herr Altgelt's footsteps came, each one a blow."
2106,LXII,On the swept flags behind the currant row
2107,LXII,Charlotta stood to greet him.  But his lip
2108,LXII,Only flicked hers.  His Concert-Meistership
2109,LXII,
2110,LXII,Was first again.  This evening he had got
2111,LXII,Important news.  The opera ordered from
2112,LXII,"Young Mozart was arrived.  That old despot,"
2113,LXII,"The Bishop of Salzburg, had let him come"
2114,LXII,"Himself to lead it, and the parts, still hot"
2115,LXII,"From copying, had been tried over.  Never"
2116,LXII,Had any music started such a fever.
2117,LXII,
2118,LXII,"The orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse,"
2119,LXII,"The singers clapped and clapped.  The town was made,"
2120,LXII,With such a great attraction through the course
2121,LXII,Of Carnival time.  In what utter shade
2122,LXII,All other cities would be left!  The trade
2123,LXII,In music would all drift here naturally.
2124,LXII,In his excitement he forgot his tea.
2125,LXII,
2126,LXII,Lotta was forced to take his cup and put
2127,LXII,"It in his hand.  But still he rattled on,"
2128,LXII,Sipping at intervals.  The new catgut
2129,LXII,Strings he was using gave out such a tone
2130,LXII,"The ""Maestro"" had remarked it, and had gone"
2131,LXII,"Out of his way to praise him.  Lotta smiled,"
2132,LXII,He was as happy as a little child.
2133,LXII,
2134,LXII,"From that day on, Herr Altgelt, more and more,"
2135,LXII,Absorbed himself in work.  Lotta at first
2136,LXII,Was patient and well-wishing.  But it wore
2137,LXII,Upon her when two weeks had brought no burst
2138,LXII,Of loving from him.  Then she feared the worst;
2139,LXII,That his short interest in her was a light
2140,LXII,Flared up an instant only in the night.
2141,LXII,
2142,LXII,"'Idomeneo' was the opera's name,"
2143,LXII,A name that poor Charlotta learnt to hate.
2144,LXII,Herr Altgelt worked so hard he seldom came
2145,LXII,"Home for his tea, and it was very late,"
2146,LXII,"Past midnight sometimes, when he knocked.  His state"
2147,LXII,Was like a flabby orange whose crushed skin
2148,LXII,"Is thin with pulling, and all dented in."
2149,LXII,
2150,LXII,He practised every morning and her heart
2151,LXII,"Followed his bow.  But often she would sit,"
2152,LXII,"While he was playing, quite withdrawn apart,"
2153,LXII,"Absently fingering and touching it,"
2154,LXII,"The locket, which now seemed to her a bit"
2155,LXII,"Of some gone youth.  His music drew her tears,"
2156,LXII,"And through the notes he played, her dreading ears"
2157,LXII,
2158,LXII,"Heard Heinrich's voice, saying he had not changed;"
2159,LXII,Beer merchants had no ecstasies to take
2160,LXII,Their minds off love.  So far her thoughts had ranged
2161,LXII,"Away from her stern vow, she chanced to take"
2162,LXII,"Her way, one morning, quite by a mistake,"
2163,LXII,Along the street where Heinrich had his shop.
2164,LXII,What harm to pass it since she should not stop!
2165,LXII,
2166,LXII,It matters nothing how one day she met
2167,LXII,"Him on a bridge, and blushed, and hurried by."
2168,LXII,Nor how the following week he stood to let
2169,LXII,"Her pass, the pavement narrowing suddenly."
2170,LXII,"How once he took her basket, and once he"
2171,LXII,Pulled back a rearing horse who might have struck
2172,LXII,Her with his hoofs.  It seemed the oddest luck
2173,LXII,
2174,LXII,How many times their business took them each
2175,LXII,"Right to the other.  Then at last he spoke,"
2176,LXII,"But she would only nod, he got no speech"
2177,LXII,"From her.  Next time he treated it in joke,"
2178,LXII,And that so lightly that her vow she broke
2179,LXII,And answered.  So they drifted into seeing
2180,LXII,Each other as before.  There was no fleeing.
2181,LXII,
2182,LXII,Christmas was over and the Carnival
2183,LXII,"Was very near, and tripping from each tongue"
2184,LXII,Was talk of the new opera.  Each book-stall
2185,LXII,"Flaunted it out in bills, what airs were sung,"
2186,LXII,What singers hired.  Pictures of the young
2187,LXII,"""Maestro"" were for sale.  The town was mad."
2188,LXII,Only Charlotta felt depressed and sad.
2189,LXII,
2190,LXII,Each day now brought a struggle 'twixt her will
2191,LXII,And Heinrich's.  'Twixt her love for Theodore
2192,LXII,And him.  Sometimes she wished to kill
2193,LXII,Herself to solve her problem.  For a score
2194,LXII,Of reasons Heinrich tempted her.  He bore
2195,LXII,"Her moods with patience, and so surely urged"
2196,LXII,"Himself upon her, she was slowly merged"
2197,LXII,
2198,LXII,"Into his way of thinking, and to fly"
2199,LXII,With him seemed easy.  But next morning would
2200,LXII,The Stradivarius undo her mood.
2201,LXII,Then she would realize that she must cleave
2202,LXII,Always to Theodore.  And she would try
2203,LXII,"To convince Heinrich she should never leave,"
2204,LXII,And afterwards she would go home and grieve.
2205,LXII,
2206,LXII,All thought in Munich centered on the part
2207,LXII,Of January when there would be given
2208,LXII,'Idomeneo' by Wolfgang Mozart.
2209,LXII,"The twenty-ninth was fixed.  And all seats, even"
2210,LXII,"Those almost at the ceiling, which were driven"
2211,LXII,"Behind the highest gallery, were sold."
2212,LXII,The inches of the theatre went for gold.
2213,LXII,
2214,LXII,Herr Altgelt was a shadow worn so thin
2215,LXII,"With work, he hardly printed black behind"
2216,LXII,The candle.  He and his old violin
2217,LXII,"Made up one person.  He was not unkind,"
2218,LXII,"But dazed outside his playing, and the rind,"
2219,LXII,"The pine and maple of his fiddle, guarded"
2220,LXII,A part of him which he had quite discarded.
2221,LXII,
2222,LXII,"It woke in the silence of frost-bright nights,"
2223,LXII,"In little lights,"
2224,LXII,"Like will-o'-the-wisps flickering, fluttering,"
2225,LXII,Here--there--
2226,LXII,"Spurting, sputtering,"
2227,LXII,"Fading and lighting,"
2228,LXII,"Together, asunder--"
2229,LXII,"Till Lotta sat up in bed with wonder,"
2230,LXII,And the faint grey patch of the window shone
2231,LXII,"Upon her sitting there, alone."
2232,LXII,For Theodore slept.
2233,LXII,
2234,LXII,"The twenty-eighth was last rehearsal day,"
2235,LXII,"'Twas called for noon, so early morning meant"
2236,LXII,Herr Altgelt's only time in which to play
2237,LXII,His part alone.  Drawn like a monk who's spent
2238,LXII,"Himself in prayer and fasting, Theodore went"
2239,LXII,"Into the kitchen, with a weary word"
2240,LXII,"Of cheer to Lotta, careless if she heard."
2241,LXII,
2242,LXII,Lotta heard more than his spoken word.
2243,LXII,She heard the vibrating of strings and wood.
2244,LXII,"She was washing the dishes, her hands all suds,"
2245,LXII,"When the sound began,"
2246,LXII,Long as the span
2247,LXII,Of a white road snaking about a hill.
2248,LXII,The orchards are filled
2249,LXII,With cherry blossoms at butterfly poise.
2250,LXII,"Hawthorn buds are cracking,"
2251,LXII,And in the distance a shepherd is clacking
2252,LXII,"His shears, snip-snipping the wool from his sheep."
2253,LXII,"The notes are asleep,"
2254,LXII,Lying adrift on the air
2255,LXII,In level lines
2256,LXII,"Like sunlight hanging in pines and pines,"
2257,LXII,"Strung and threaded,"
2258,LXII,All imbedded
2259,LXII,In the blue-green of the hazy pines.
2260,LXII,"Lines--long, straight lines!"
2261,LXII,"And stems,"
2262,LXII,"Long, straight stems"
2263,LXII,Pushing up
2264,LXII,"To the cup of blue, blue sky."
2265,LXII,Stems growing misty
2266,LXII,"With the many of them,"
2267,LXII,Red-green mist
2268,LXII,"Of the trees,"
2269,LXII,And these
2270,LXII,Wood-flavoured notes.
2271,LXII,The back is maple and the belly is pine.
2272,LXII,The rich notes twine
2273,LXII,"As though weaving in and out of leaves,"
2274,LXII,Broad leaves
2275,LXII,"Flapping slowly like elephants' ears,"
2276,LXII,Waving and falling.
2277,LXII,Another sound peers
2278,LXII,"Through little pine fingers,"
2279,LXII,"And lingers, peeping."
2280,LXII,"Ping!  Ping!  pizzicato, something is cheeping."
2281,LXII,"There is a twittering up in the branches,"
2282,LXII,"A chirp and a lilt,"
2283,LXII,And crimson atilt on a swaying twig.
2284,LXII,Wings!  Wings!
2285,LXII,And a little ruffled-out throat which sings.
2286,LXII,"The forest bends, tumultuous"
2287,LXII,With song.
2288,LXII,"The woodpecker knocks,"
2289,LXII,"And the song-sparrow trills,"
2290,LXII,"Every fir, and cedar, and yew"
2291,LXII,"Has a nest or a bird,"
2292,LXII,It is quite absurd
2293,LXII,To hear them cutting across each other:
2294,LXII,"Peewits, and thrushes, and larks, all at once,"
2295,LXII,And a loud cuckoo is trying to smother
2296,LXII,"A wood-pigeon perched on a birch,"
2297,LXII,"""Roo--coo--oo--oo--"""
2298,LXII,"""Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!  That's one for you!"""
2299,LXII,"A blackbird whistles, how sharp, how shrill!"
2300,LXII,And the great trees toss
2301,LXII,"And leaves blow down,"
2302,LXII,You can almost hear them splash on the ground.
2303,LXII,The whistle again:
2304,LXII,It is double and loud!
2305,LXII,"The leaves are splashing,"
2306,LXII,And water is dashing
2307,LXII,"Over those creepers, for they are shrouds;"
2308,LXII,"And men are running up them to furl the sails,"
2309,LXII,"For there is a capful of wind to-day,"
2310,LXII,And we are already well under way.
2311,LXII,The deck is aslant in the bubbling breeze.
2312,LXII,"""Theodore, please."
2313,LXII,"Oh, Dear, how you tease!"""
2314,LXII,"And the boatswain's whistle sounds again,"
2315,LXII,And the men pull on the sheets:
2316,LXII,"""My name is Hanging Johnny,"
2317,LXII,Away-i-oh;
2318,LXII,"They call me Hanging Johnny,"
2319,LXII,"So hang, boys, hang."""
2320,LXII,"The trees of the forest are masts, tall masts;"
2321,LXII,They are swinging over
2322,LXII,Her and her lover.
2323,LXII,Almost swooning
2324,LXII,"Under the ballooning canvas,"
2325,LXII,She lies
2326,LXII,Looking up in his eyes
2327,LXII,As he bends farther over.
2328,LXII,"Theodore, still her lover!"
2329,LXII,
2330,LXII,"The suds were dried upon Charlotta's hands,"
2331,LXII,"She leant against the table for support,"
2332,LXII,Wholly forgotten.  Theodore's eyes were brands
2333,LXII,Burning upon his music.  He stopped short.
2334,LXII,Charlotta almost heard the sound of bands
2335,LXII,"Snapping.  She put one hand up to her heart,"
2336,LXII,Her fingers touched the locket with a start.
2337,LXII,
2338,LXII,Herr Altgelt put his violin away
2339,LXII,"Listlessly.  ""Lotta, I must have some rest."
2340,LXII,The strain will be a hideous one to-day.
2341,LXII,Don't speak to me at all.  It will be best
2342,LXII,"If I am quiet till I go.""  And lest"
2343,LXII,"She disobey, he left her.  On the stairs"
2344,LXII,She heard his mounting steps.  What use were prayers!
2345,LXII,
2346,LXII,"He could not hear, he was not there, for she"
2347,LXII,"Was married to a mummy, a machine."
2348,LXII,Her hand closed on the locket bitterly.
2349,LXII,"Before her, on a chair, lay the shagreen"
2350,LXII,Case of his violin.  She saw the clean
2351,LXII,Sun flash the open clasp.  The locket's edge
2352,LXII,Cut at her fingers like a pushing wedge.
2353,LXII,
2354,LXII,"A heavy cart went by, a distant bell"
2355,LXII,"Chimed ten, the fire flickered in the grate."
2356,LXII,She was alone.  Her throat began to swell
2357,LXII,"With sobs.  What kept her here, why should she wait?"
2358,LXII,The violin she had begun to hate
2359,LXII,Lay in its case before her.  Here she flung
2360,LXII,The cover open.  With the fiddle swung
2361,LXII,
2362,LXII,"Over her head, the hanging clock's loud ticking"
2363,LXII,"Caught on her ear.  'Twas slow, and as she paused"
2364,LXII,"The little door in it came open, flicking"
2365,LXII,"A wooden cuckoo out:  ""Cuckoo!""  It caused"
2366,LXII,"The forest dream to come again.  ""Cuckoo!"""
2367,LXII,"Smashed on the grate, the violin broke in two."
2368,LXII,
2369,LXII,"""Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"" the clock kept striking on;"
2370,LXII,But no one listened.  Frau Altgelt had gone.
2371,LXII,
2372,LXII,
2373,LXII,
2374,LXII,
2375,LXII,The Cross-Roads
2376,LXII,
2377,LXII,
2378,LXII,
2379,LXII,A bullet through his heart at dawn.  On the table a letter signed with a
2380,LXII,"woman's name.  A wind that goes howling round the house, and weeping as"
2381,LXII,"in shame.  Cold November dawn peeping through the windows, cold dawn"
2382,LXII,"creeping over the floor, creeping up his cold legs, creeping over his"
2383,LXII,"cold body, creeping across his cold face. A glaze of thin yellow"
2384,LXII,sunlight on the staring eyes.  Wind howling through bent branches.  A
2385,LXII,"wind which never dies down.  Howling, wailing. The gazing eyes glitter"
2386,LXII,in the sunlight.  The lids are frozen open and the eyes glitter.
2387,LXII,
2388,LXII,
2389,LXII,The thudding of a pick on hard earth.  A spade grinding and crunching.
2390,LXII,"Overhead, branches writhing, winding, interlacing, unwinding,"
2391,LXII,"scattering; tortured twinings, tossings, creakings.  Wind flinging"
2392,LXII,"branches apart, drawing them together, whispering and whining among"
2393,LXII,"them.  A waning, lopsided moon cutting through black clouds.  A stream"
2394,LXII,"of pebbles and earth and the empty spade gleams clear in the moonlight,"
2395,LXII,then is rammed again into the black earth.  Tramping of feet.  Men and
2396,LXII,horses. Squeaking of wheels.
2397,LXII,
2398,LXII,"""Whoa!  Ready, Jim?"""
2399,LXII,
2400,LXII,"""All ready."""
2401,LXII,
2402,LXII,"Something falls, settles, is still.  Suicides have no coffin."
2403,LXII,
2404,LXII,"""Give us the stake, Jim.  Now."""
2405,LXII,
2406,LXII,Pound!  Pound!
2407,LXII,
2408,LXII,"""He'll never walk.  Nailed to the ground."""
2409,LXII,
2410,LXII,"An ash stick pierces his heart, if it buds the roots will hold him. He"
2411,LXII,"is a part of the earth now, clay to clay.  Overhead the branches sway,"
2412,LXII,"and writhe, and twist in the wind.  He'll never walk with a bullet in"
2413,LXII,"his heart, and an ash stick nailing him to the cold, black ground."
2414,LXII,
2415,LXII,
2416,LXII,Six months he lay still.  Six months.  And the water welled up in his
2417,LXII,"body, and soft blue spots chequered it.  He lay still, for the ash stick"
2418,LXII,held him in place.  Six months!  Then her face came out of a mist of
2419,LXII,"green. Pink and white and frail like Dresden china, lilies-of-the-valley"
2420,LXII,"at her breast, puce-coloured silk sheening about her.  Under the young"
2421,LXII,"green leaves, the horse at a foot-pace, the high yellow wheels of the"
2422,LXII,"chaise scarcely turning, her face, rippling like grain a-blowing, under"
2423,LXII,"her puce-coloured bonnet; and burning beside her, flaming within his"
2424,LXII,"correct blue coat and brass buttons, is someone.  What has dimmed the"
2425,LXII,sun? The horse steps on a rolling stone; a wind in the branches makes a
2426,LXII,"moan. The little leaves tremble and shake, turn and quake, over and"
2427,LXII,"over, tearing their stems.  There is a shower of young leaves, and a"
2428,LXII,sudden-sprung gale wails in the trees.
2429,LXII,
2430,LXII,"The yellow-wheeled chaise is rocking--rocking, and all the branches"
2431,LXII,"are knocking--knocking.  The sun in the sky is a flat, red plate, the"
2432,LXII,"branches creak and grate.  She screams and cowers, for the green foliage"
2433,LXII,is a lowering wave surging to smother her.  But she sees nothing. The
2434,LXII,"stake holds firm.  The body writhes, the body squirms. The blue spots"
2435,LXII,"widen, the flesh tears, but the stake wears well in the deep, black"
2436,LXII,"ground.  It holds the body in the still, black ground."
2437,LXII,
2438,LXII,
2439,LXII,Two years!  The body has been in the ground two years.  It is worn away;
2440,LXII,"it is clay to clay.  Where the heart moulders, a greenish dust, the"
2441,LXII,"stake is thrust.  Late August it is, and night; a night flauntingly"
2442,LXII,"jewelled with stars, a night of shooting stars and loud insect noises."
2443,LXII,"Down the road to Tilbury, silence--and the slow flapping of large"
2444,LXII,"leaves. Down the road to Sutton, silence--and the darkness of"
2445,LXII,"heavy-foliaged trees. Down the road to Wayfleet, silence--and the"
2446,LXII,whirring scrape of insects in the branches.  Down the road to
2447,LXII,"Edgarstown, silence--and stars like stepping-stones in a pathway"
2448,LXII,"overhead.  It is very quiet at the cross-roads, and the sign-board"
2449,LXII,"points the way down the four roads, endlessly points the way where"
2450,LXII,nobody wishes to go.
2451,LXII,
2452,LXII,"A horse is galloping, galloping up from Sutton.  Shaking the wide, still"
2453,LXII,leaves as he goes under them.  Striking sparks with his iron shoes;
2454,LXII,silencing the katydids.  Dr. Morgan riding to a child-birth over Tilbury
2455,LXII,way; riding to deliver a woman of her first-born son.  One o'clock from
2456,LXII,"Wayfleet bell tower, what a shower of shooting stars!  And a breeze all"
2457,LXII,"of a sudden, jarring the big leaves and making them jerk up and down."
2458,LXII,"Dr. Morgan's hat is blown from his head, the horse swerves, and curves"
2459,LXII,away from the sign-post.  An oath--spurs--a blurring of grey mist. A
2460,LXII,"quick left twist, and the gelding is snorting and racing down the"
2461,LXII,Tilbury road with the wind dropping away behind him.
2462,LXII,
2463,LXII,"The stake has wrenched, the stake has started, the body, flesh from"
2464,LXII,"flesh, has parted.  But the bones hold tight, socket and ball, and"
2465,LXII,"clamping them down in the hard, black ground is the stake, wedged"
2466,LXII,"through ribs and spine. The bones may twist, and heave, and twine, but"
2467,LXII,"the stake holds them still in line.  The breeze goes down, and the round"
2468,LXII,"stars shine, for the stake holds the fleshless bones in line."
2469,LXII,
2470,LXII,
2471,LXII,Twenty years now!  Twenty long years!  The body has powdered itself
2472,LXII,away; it is clay to clay.  It is brown earth mingled with brown earth.
2473,LXII,"Only flaky bones remain, lain together so long they fit, although not"
2474,LXII,"one bone is knit to another.  The stake is there too, rotted through,"
2475,LXII,"but upright still, and still piercing down between ribs and spine in a"
2476,LXII,straight line.
2477,LXII,
2478,LXII,"Yellow stillness is on the cross-roads, yellow stillness is on the"
2479,LXII,"trees. The leaves hang drooping, wan.  The four roads point four yellow"
2480,LXII,"ways, saffron and gamboge ribbons to the gaze.  A little swirl of dust"
2481,LXII,"blows up Tilbury road, the wind which fans it has not strength to do"
2482,LXII,"more; it ceases, and the dust settles down.  A little whirl of wind"
2483,LXII,comes up Tilbury road.  It brings a sound of wheels and feet. The wind
2484,LXII,"reels a moment and faints to nothing under the sign-post. Wind again,"
2485,LXII,"wheels and feet louder.  Wind again--again--again. A drop of rain,"
2486,LXII,"flat into the dust.  Drop!--Drop!  Thick heavy raindrops, and a"
2487,LXII,shrieking wind bending the great trees and wrenching off their leaves.
2488,LXII,
2489,LXII,"Under the black sky, bowed and dripping with rain, up Tilbury road,"
2490,LXII,"comes the procession.  A funeral procession, bound for the graveyard at"
2491,LXII,Wayfleet.  Feet and wheels--feet and wheels.  And among them one who
2492,LXII,is carried.
2493,LXII,
2494,LXII,"The bones in the deep, still earth shiver and pull.  There is a quiver"
2495,LXII,through the rotted stake.  Then stake and bones fall together in a
2496,LXII,little puffing of dust.
2497,LXII,
2498,LXII,"Like meshes of linked steel the rain shuts down behind the procession,"
2499,LXII,now well along the Wayfleet road.
2500,LXII,
2501,LXII,He wavers like smoke in the buffeting wind.  His fingers blow out like
2502,LXII,"smoke, his head ripples in the gale.  Under the sign-post, in the"
2503,LXII,"pouring rain, he stands, and watches another quavering figure drifting"
2504,LXII,down the Wayfleet road.  Then swiftly he streams after it.  It flickers
2505,LXII,"among the trees.  He licks out and winds about them.  Over, under,"
2506,LXII,"blown, contorted.  Spindrift after spindrift; smoke following smoke."
2507,LXII,"There is a wailing through the trees, a wailing of fear, and after it"
2508,LXII,"laughter--laughter--laughter, skirling up to the black sky."
2509,LXII,Lightning jags over the funeral procession.  A heavy clap of thunder.
2510,LXII,"Then darkness and rain, and the sound of feet and wheels."

2535,I,Their diamond whiteness cleaving the yellow sunshine.
2536,I,"The gravel crunches and squeaks beneath them,"

2540,I,In a series of little jumps.

2542,I,"Spring, Hoops!"
2543,I,Spit out a shower of blue and white brightness.

3048,II,The little black slave with the yellow satin turban
3049,II,Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes.
3050,II,His yellow turban and black skin

3052,II,The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings

3055,II,"Yellow and black,"

3064,II,
3065,II,A yellow wall

3068,II,"Shadows of vine leaves,"
3069,II,Shadows of masks.
3070,II,"Masks coming, printing themselves for an instant,"
3071,II,"Then passing on,"
3072,II,More masks always replacing them.
3073,II,Masks with tricorns and rapiers sticking out behind
3074,II,"Pursuing masks with plumes and high heels,"
3075,II,The sunlight shining under their insteps.
3076,II,"One,"
3077,II,"One, two,"
3078,II,"One, two, three,"
3079,II,"There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall,"
3080,II,Filigreed at the top with moving leaves.
3081,II,"Yellow sunlight and black shadows,"
3082,II,"Yellow and black,"
3083,II,Gorgeous--barbaric.
3084,II,"Two masks stand together,"
3085,II,"And the shadow of a leaf falls through them,"
3086,II,Marking the wall where they are not.
3087,II,"From hat-tip to shoulder-tip,"
3088,II,"From elbow to sword-hilt,"
3089,II,The leaf falls.
3090,II,"The shadows mingle,"
3091,II,"Blur together,"
3092,II,Slide along the wall and disappear.
3093,II,"Gold of mosaics and candles,"
3094,II,And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams.
3095,II,Saint Mark's glitters with flames and reflections.
3096,II,"A cloak brushes aside,"
3097,II,And the yellow of satin
3098,II,Licks out over the coloured inlays of the pavement.
3099,II,Under the gold crucifixes
3100,II,There is a meeting of hands
3101,II,Reaching from black mantles.
3102,II,"Sighing embraces, bold investigations,"
3103,II,"Hide in confessionals,"
3104,II,Sheltered by the shuffling of feet.
3105,II,Gorgeous--barbaric
3106,II,"In its mail of jewels and gold,"
3107,II,Saint Mark's looks down at the swarm of black masks;
3108,II,"And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall,"
3109,II,"Flutter,"
3110,II,Fall.
3111,II,"Brown,"
3112,II,And yellow streaked with brown.
3113,II,
3114,II,"Blue-black, the sky over Venice,"
3115,II,With a pricking of yellow stars.
3116,II,"There is no moon,"
3117,II,And the waves push darkly against the prow
3118,II,"Of the gondola,"
3119,II,Coming from Malamocco
3120,II,And streaming toward Venice.
3121,II,"It is black under the gondola hood,"
3122,II,But the yellow of a satin dress
3123,II,Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger.
3124,II,"Yellow compassed about with darkness,"
3125,II,"Yellow and black,"
3126,II,Gorgeous--barbaric.
3127,II,"The boatman sings,"
3128,II,It is Tasso that he sings;

3131,II,"But at Malamocco in front,"
3132,II,"In Venice behind,"
3133,II,"Fall the leaves,"
3134,II,"Brown,"

3156,BRONZE TABLETS,She pluckered her little brows into

3167,BRONZE TABLETS,Poor fellows with guns and bayonets for shrouds!
3168,BRONZE TABLETS,"Pray, Mademoiselle, come out of the sun."
3169,BRONZE TABLETS,Let me dust off that wicker chair.  It's cool
3170,BRONZE TABLETS,"In here, for the green leaves I have run"
3171,BRONZE TABLETS,"In a curtain over the door, make a pool"
3172,BRONZE TABLETS,Of shade.  You see the pears on that stool--
3173,BRONZE TABLETS,"The shadow keeps them plump and fair."""
3174,BRONZE TABLETS,"Over the fruiterer's door, the leaves"
3175,BRONZE TABLETS,"Held back the sun, a greenish flare"
3176,BRONZE TABLETS,"Quivered and sparked the shop, the sheaves"

3178,BRONZE TABLETS,"Shot from the golden letters, broke"
3179,BRONZE TABLETS,And splintered to little scattered lights.
3180,BRONZE TABLETS,"Jeanne Tourmont entered the shop, her poke"
3181,BRONZE TABLETS,"Bonnet tilted itself to rights,"
3182,BRONZE TABLETS,And her face looked out like the moon on nights

3184,BRONZE TABLETS,"Want gooseberries, an apple or two,"
3185,BRONZE TABLETS,"Or excellent plums, but not if they're high;"
3186,BRONZE TABLETS,Haven't you some which a strong wind blew?
3187,BRONZE TABLETS,"I've only a couple of francs for you."""
3188,BRONZE TABLETS,Monsieur Popain shrugged and rubbed his hands.
3189,BRONZE TABLETS,"What could he do, the times were sad."
3190,BRONZE TABLETS,A couple of francs and such demands!
3191,BRONZE TABLETS,And asking for fruits a little bad.
3192,BRONZE TABLETS,Wind-blown indeed!  He never had
3193,BRONZE TABLETS,Anything else than the very best.
3194,BRONZE TABLETS,He pointed to baskets of blunted pears
3195,BRONZE TABLETS,"With the thin skin tight like a bursting vest,"
3196,BRONZE TABLETS,"All yellow, and red, and brown, in smears."
3197,BRONZE TABLETS,Monsieur Popain's voice denoted tears.
3198,BRONZE TABLETS,"He took up a pear with tender care,"
3199,BRONZE TABLETS,And pressed it with his hardened thumb.
3200,BRONZE TABLETS,"""Smell it, Mademoiselle, the perfume there"
3201,BRONZE TABLETS,"Is like lavender, and sweet thoughts come"
3202,BRONZE TABLETS,Only from having a dish at home.
3203,BRONZE TABLETS,"And those grapes!  They melt in the mouth like wine,"
3204,BRONZE TABLETS,"Just a click of the tongue, and they burst to honey."
3205,BRONZE TABLETS,"They're only this morning off the vine,"
3206,BRONZE TABLETS,And I paid for them down in silver money.
3207,BRONZE TABLETS,"The Corporal's widow is witness, her pony"
3208,BRONZE TABLETS,Brought them in at sunrise to-day.
3209,BRONZE TABLETS,Those oranges--Gold!  They're almost red.
3210,BRONZE TABLETS,They seem little chips just broken away
3211,BRONZE TABLETS,From the sun itself.  Or perhaps instead
3212,BRONZE TABLETS,"You'd like a pomegranate, they're rarely gay,"
3213,BRONZE TABLETS,When you split them the seeds are like crimson spray.
3214,BRONZE TABLETS,"Yes, they're high, they're high, and those Turkey figs,"
3215,BRONZE TABLETS,"They all come from the South, and Nelson's ships"
3216,BRONZE TABLETS,Make it a little hard for our rigs.
3217,BRONZE TABLETS,They must be forever giving the slips
3218,BRONZE TABLETS,"To the cursed English, and when men clips"
3219,BRONZE TABLETS,"Through powder to bring them, why dainties mounts"
3220,BRONZE TABLETS,"A bit in price.  Those almonds now,"
3221,BRONZE TABLETS,"I'll strip off that husk, when one discounts"
3222,BRONZE TABLETS,A life or two in a nigger row
3223,BRONZE TABLETS,"With the man who grew them, it does seem how"
3224,BRONZE TABLETS,They would come dear; and then the fight
3225,BRONZE TABLETS,"At sea perhaps, our boats have heels"
3226,BRONZE TABLETS,"And mostly they sail along at night,"
3227,BRONZE TABLETS,But once in a way they're caught; one feels
3228,BRONZE TABLETS,Ivory's not better nor finer--why peels
3229,BRONZE TABLETS,From an almond kernel are worth two sous.
3230,BRONZE TABLETS,"It's hard to sell them now,"" he sighed."
3231,BRONZE TABLETS,"""Purses are tight, but I shall not lose."
3232,BRONZE TABLETS,"There's plenty of cheaper things to choose."""
3233,BRONZE TABLETS,He picked some currants out of a wide
3234,BRONZE TABLETS,"Earthen bowl.  ""They make the tongue"
3235,BRONZE TABLETS,"Almost fly out to suck them, bride"
3236,BRONZE TABLETS,"Currants they are, they were planted long"
3237,BRONZE TABLETS,"Ago for some new Marquise, among"
3238,BRONZE TABLETS,"Other great beauties, before the Chateau"
3239,BRONZE TABLETS,"Was left to rot.  Now the Gardener's wife,"
3240,BRONZE TABLETS,"He that marched off to his death at Marengo,"
3241,BRONZE TABLETS,Sells them to me; she keeps her life
3242,BRONZE TABLETS,"From snuffing out, with her pruning knife."
3243,BRONZE TABLETS,"She's a poor old thing, but she learnt the trade"
3244,BRONZE TABLETS,"When her man was young, and the young Marquis"
3245,BRONZE TABLETS,Couldn't have enough garden.  The flowers he made
3246,BRONZE TABLETS,All new!  And the fruits!  But 'twas said that he
3247,BRONZE TABLETS,"Was no friend to the people, and so they laid"
3248,BRONZE TABLETS,"Some charge against him, a cavalcade"
3249,BRONZE TABLETS,Of citizens took him away; they meant
3250,BRONZE TABLETS,"Well, but I think there was some mistake."
3251,BRONZE TABLETS,"He just pottered round in his garden, bent"
3252,BRONZE TABLETS,On growing things; we were so awake
3253,BRONZE TABLETS,In those days for the New Republic's sake.
3254,BRONZE TABLETS,"He's gone, and the garden is all that's left"
3255,BRONZE TABLETS,"Not in ruin, but the currants and apricots,"
3256,BRONZE TABLETS,"And peaches, furred and sweet, with a cleft"
3257,BRONZE TABLETS,"Full of morning dew, in those green-glazed pots,"
3258,BRONZE TABLETS,"Why, Mademoiselle, there is never an eft"
3259,BRONZE TABLETS,"Or worm among them, and as for theft,"
3260,BRONZE TABLETS,"How the old woman keeps them I cannot say,"
3261,BRONZE TABLETS,"But they're finer than any grown this way."""
3262,BRONZE TABLETS,Jeanne Tourmont drew back the filigree ring
3263,BRONZE TABLETS,"Of her striped silk purse, tipped it upside down"
3264,BRONZE TABLETS,"And shook it, two coins fell with a ding"
3265,BRONZE TABLETS,"Of striking silver, beneath her gown"
3266,BRONZE TABLETS,"One rolled, the other lay, a thing"
3267,BRONZE TABLETS,"Sparked white and sharply glistening,"
3268,BRONZE TABLETS,In a drop of sunlight between two shades.
3269,BRONZE TABLETS,"She jerked the purse, took its empty ends"
3270,BRONZE TABLETS,And crumpled them toward the centre braids.
3271,BRONZE TABLETS,The whole collapsed to a mass of blends
3272,BRONZE TABLETS,"Of colours and stripes.  ""Monsieur Popain, friends"
3273,BRONZE TABLETS,We have always been.  In the days before
3274,BRONZE TABLETS,The Great Revolution my aunt was kind
3275,BRONZE TABLETS,When you needed help.  You need no more;
3276,BRONZE TABLETS,"'Tis we now who must beg at your door,"
3277,BRONZE TABLETS,"And will you refuse?""  The little man"
3278,BRONZE TABLETS,"Bustled, denied, his heart was good,"
3279,BRONZE TABLETS,But times were hard.  He went to a pan
3280,BRONZE TABLETS,And poured upon the counter a flood
3281,BRONZE TABLETS,"Of pungent raspberries, tanged like wood."
3282,BRONZE TABLETS,He took a melon with rough green rind
3283,BRONZE TABLETS,And rubbed it well with his apron tip.
3284,BRONZE TABLETS,Then he hunted over the shop to find
3285,BRONZE TABLETS,"Some walnuts cracking at the lip,"
3286,BRONZE TABLETS,And added to these a barberry slip
3287,BRONZE TABLETS,"Whose acrid, oval berries hung"
3288,BRONZE TABLETS,Like fringe and trembled.  He reached a round
3289,BRONZE TABLETS,"Basket, with handles, from where it swung"
3290,BRONZE TABLETS,"Against the wall, laid it on the ground"
3291,BRONZE TABLETS,"And filled it, then he searched and found"
3292,BRONZE TABLETS,The francs Jeanne Tourmont had let fall.
3293,BRONZE TABLETS,"""You'll return the basket, Mademoiselle?"""
3294,BRONZE TABLETS,"She smiled, ""The next time that I call,"
3295,BRONZE TABLETS,"Monsieur.  You know that very well."""
3296,BRONZE TABLETS,"'Twas lightly said, but meant to tell."
3297,BRONZE TABLETS,"Monsieur Popain bowed, somewhat abashed."
3298,BRONZE TABLETS,She took her basket and stepped out.
3299,BRONZE TABLETS,The sunlight was so bright it flashed
3300,BRONZE TABLETS,"Her eyes to blindness, and the rout"
3301,BRONZE TABLETS,Of the little street was all about.
3302,BRONZE TABLETS,"Through glare and noise she stumbled, dazed."
3303,BRONZE TABLETS,The heavy basket was a care.
3304,BRONZE TABLETS,She heard a shout and almost grazed
3305,BRONZE TABLETS,The panels of a chaise and pair.
3306,BRONZE TABLETS,"The postboy yelled, and an amazed"
3307,BRONZE TABLETS,Face from the carriage window gazed.
3308,BRONZE TABLETS,"She jumped back just in time, her heart"
3309,BRONZE TABLETS,Beating with fear.  Through whirling light
3310,BRONZE TABLETS,"The chaise departed, but her smart"
3311,BRONZE TABLETS,Was keen and bitter.  In the white
3312,BRONZE TABLETS,Dust of the street she saw a bright
3313,BRONZE TABLETS,"Streak of colours, wet and gay,"
3314,BRONZE TABLETS,"Red like blood.  Crushed but fair,"
3315,BRONZE TABLETS,Her fruit stained the cobbles of the way.
3316,BRONZE TABLETS,Monsieur Popain joined her there.

3438,III,"as something indefinably fair, a rose above periwinkles.  A blown rose,"
3439,III,"smooth as satin, reflexed, one loosened petal hanging back and down. A"
3440,III,"rose that undulates languorously as the breeze takes it, resting upon"
3441,III,its leaves in a faintness of perfume.
3442,III,
3443,III,
3444,III,"There are rumours about the First Consul.  Malmaison is full of women,"
3445,III,and Paris is only two leagues distant.  Madame Bonaparte stands on the
3446,III,"wooden bridge at sunset, and watches a black swan pushing the pink and"
3447,III,"silver water in front of him as he swims, crinkling its smoothness into"
3448,III,pleats of changing colour with his breast. Madame Bonaparte presses
3449,III,"against the parapet of the bridge, and the crushed roses at her belt"
3450,III,"melt, petal by petal, into the pink water."

3453,IV,IV
3454,IV,
3455,IV,"A vile day, Porter.  But keep your wits about you.  The Empress will"
3456,IV,"soon be here.  Queer, without the Emperor!  It is indeed, but best not"
3457,IV,consider that.  Scratch your head and prick up your ears. Divorce is not
3458,IV,"for you to debate about.  She is late?  Ah, well, the roads are muddy."
3459,IV,"The rain spears are as sharp as whetted knives. They dart down and down,"
3460,IV,edged and shining.  Clop-trop!  Clop-trop! A carriage grows out of the
3461,IV,"mist.  Hist, Porter.  You can keep on your hat. It is only Her Majesty's"
3462,IV,"dogs and her parrot.  Clop-trop! The Ladies in Waiting, Porter."
3463,IV,"Clop-trop!  It is Her Majesty.  At least, I suppose it is, but the"
3464,IV,blinds are drawn.
3465,IV,
3466,IV,"""In all the years I have served Her Majesty she never before passed the"
3467,IV,"gate without giving me a smile!"""
3468,IV,
3469,IV,"You're a droll fellow, to expect the Empress to put out her head in the"
3470,IV,pouring rain and salute you.  She has affairs of her own to think about.
3471,IV,
3472,IV,"Clang the gate, no need for further waiting, nobody else will be coming"
3473,IV,to Malmaison to-night.
3474,IV,
3475,IV,
3476,IV,"White under her veil, drained and shaking, the woman crosses the"
3477,IV,"antechamber. Empress!  Empress!  Foolish splendour, perished to dust."
3478,IV,"Ashes of roses, ashes of youth.  Empress forsooth!"
3479,IV,
3480,IV,Over the glass domes of the hot-houses drenches the rain.  Behind her a
3481,IV,clock ticks--ticks again.  The sound knocks upon her thought with the
3482,IV,"echoing shudder of hollow vases.  She places her hands on her ears, but"
3483,IV,"the minutes pass, knocking.  Tears in Malmaison.  And years to come each"
3484,IV,"knocking by, minute after minute.  Years, many years, and tears, and"
3485,IV,cold pouring rain.
3486,IV,
3487,IV,"""I feel as though I had died, and the only sensation I have is that I am"

3493,V,V
3494,V,
3495,V,"The roses bloom at Malmaison.  And not only roses.  Tulips, myrtles,"
3496,V,"geraniums, camelias, rhododendrons, dahlias, double hyacinths. All the"
3497,V,"year through, under glass, under the sky, flowers bud, expand, die, and"
3498,V,"give way to others, always others.  From distant countries they have"
3499,V,"been brought, and taught to live in the cool temperateness of France."
3500,V,There is the 'Bonapartea' from Peru; the 'Napoleone Imperiale'; the
3501,V,"'Josephinia Imperatrix', a pearl-white flower, purple-shadowed, the"
3502,V,calix pricked out with crimson points.  Malmaison wears its flowers as a
3503,V,"lady wears her gems, flauntingly, assertively.  Malmaison decks herself"
3504,V,to hide the hollow within.
3505,V,
3506,V,"The glass-houses grow and grow, and every year fling up hotter"
3507,V,reflections to the sailing sun.
3508,V,
3509,V,"The cost runs into millions, but a woman must have something to console"
3510,V,"herself for a broken heart.  One can play backgammon and patience, and"
3511,V,"then patience and backgammon, and stake gold napoleons on each game won."
3512,V,Sport truly!  It is an unruly spirit which could ask better.  With her
3513,V,"jewels, her laces, her shawls; her two hundred and twenty dresses, her"
3514,V,"fichus, her veils; her pictures, her busts, her birds.  It is absurd"
3515,V,that she cannot be happy.  The Emperor smarts under the thought of her
3516,V,"ingratitude. What could he do more?  And yet she spends, spends as never"
3517,V,before. It is ridiculous.  Can she not enjoy life at a smaller figure?
3518,V,Was ever monarch plagued with so extravagant an ex-wife.  She owes her
3519,V,"chocolate-merchant, her candle-merchant, her sweetmeat purveyor; her"
3520,V,"grocer, her butcher, her poulterer; her architect, and the shopkeeper"
3521,V,"who sells her rouge; her perfumer, her dressmaker, her merchant of"
3522,V,"shoes. She owes for fans, plants, engravings, and chairs.  She owes"
3523,V,"masons and carpenters, vintners, lingeres.  The lady's affairs are in"
3524,V,sad confusion.
3525,V,
3526,V,And why?  Why?
3527,V,
3528,V,Can a river flow when the spring is dry?
3529,V,
3530,V,
3531,V,"Night.  The Empress sits alone, and the clock ticks, one after one. The"
3532,V,clock nicks off the edges of her life.  She is chipped like an old bit
3533,V,of china; she is frayed like a garment of last year's wearing. She is
3534,V,"soft, crinkled, like a fading rose.  And each minute flows by brushing"
3535,V,"against her, shearing off another and another petal. The Empress crushes"
3536,V,her breasts with her hands and weeps.  And the tall clouds sail over
3537,V,Malmaison like a procession of stately ships bound for the moon.
3538,V,
3539,V,
3540,V,"Scarlet, clear-blue, purple epauletted with gold.  It is a parade of"
3541,V,"soldiers sweeping up the avenue.  Eight horses, eight Imperial"
3542,V,"harnesses, four caparisoned postilions, a carriage with the Emperor's"
3543,V,"arms on the panels. Ho, Porter, pop out your eyes, and no wonder.  Where"
3544,V,else under the Heavens could you see such splendour!
3545,V,
3546,V,They sit on a stone seat.  The little man in the green coat of a Colonel
3547,V,"of Chasseurs, and the lady, beautiful as a satin seed-pod, and as pale."
3548,V,The house has memories.  The satin seed-pod holds his germs of Empire.
3549,V,"We will stay here, under the blue sky and the turreted white clouds. She"
3550,V,draws him; he feels her faded loveliness urge him to replenish it. Her
3551,V,soft transparent texture woos his nervous fingering.  He speaks to her
3552,V,"of debts, of resignation; of her children, and his; he promises that she"
3553,V,shall see the King of Rome; he says some harsh things and some pleasant.
3554,V,"But she is there, close to him, rose toned to amber, white shot with"
3555,V,"violet, pungent to his nostrils as embalmed rose-leaves in a twilit"
3556,V,room.
3557,V,
3558,V,Suddenly the Emperor calls his carriage and rolls away across the
3559,V,looping Seine.

3562,VI,VI
3563,VI,
3564,VI,Crystal-blue brightness over the glass-houses.  Crystal-blue streaks and
3565,VI,ripples over the lake.  A macaw on a gilded perch screams; they have
3566,VI,forgotten to take out his dinner.  The windows shake.  Boom!  Boom! It
3567,VI,is the rumbling of Prussian cannon beyond Pecq.  Roses bloom at
3568,VI,"Malmaison. Roses!  Roses!  Swimming above their leaves, rotting beneath"
3569,VI,them. Fallen flowers strew the unraked walks.  Fallen flowers for a
3570,VI,fallen Emperor! The General in charge of him draws back and watches.
3571,VI,"Snatches of music--snarling, sneering music of bagpipes.  They say a"
3572,VI,"Scotch regiment is besieging Saint-Denis.  The Emperor wipes his face,"
3573,VI,or is it his eyes. His tired eyes which see nowhere the grace they long
3574,VI,"for.  Josephine! Somebody asks him a question, he does not answer,"
3575,VI,"somebody else does that. There are voices, but one voice he does not"
3576,VI,"hear, and yet he hears it all the time.  Josephine!  The Emperor puts up"
3577,VI,his hand to screen his face. The white light of a bright cloud spears
3578,VI,sharply through the linden-trees. 'Vive l'Empereur!'  There are troops
3579,VI,"passing beyond the wall, troops which sing and call.  Boom!  A pink rose"
3580,VI,is jarred off its stem and falls at the Emperor's feet.
3581,VI,
3582,VI,"""Very well.  I go.""  Where!  Does it matter?  There is no sword to"
3583,VI,clatter. Nothing but soft brushing gravel and a gate which shuts with a
3584,VI,click.
3585,VI,
3586,VI,"""Quick, fellow, don't spare your horses."""

3593,VII,
3594,VII,"Over the slate roof tall clouds, like ships of the line, pass along the"

3596,VII,"broken. Roses bloom, fiery cinders quenching under damp weeds.  Wreckage"
3597,VII,"and misery, and a trailing of petty deeds smearing over old"
3598,VII,recollections.
3599,VII,
3600,VII,"The musty rooms are empty and their shutters are closed, only in the"
3601,VII,"gallery there is a stuffed black swan, covered with dust.  When you"

3623,I,"Tap to the red rising sun,"
3624,I,Tap to the purple setting sun.
3625,I,Four years pass before the job is done.
3626,I,"Two thousand oak trees grown and felled,"
3627,I,"Two thousand oaks from the hedgerows of the Weald,"
3628,I,Sussex had yielded two thousand oaks

3638,I,"You can hear, though there's nothing where you gaze."
3639,I,"Through the fog down the reaches of the river,"

3641,I,The church-bells chime
3642,I,"Hours and hours,"
3643,I,Dropping days in showers.
3644,I,Bang!  Rap!  Tap!
3645,I,Go the hammers all the time.
3646,I,They have planked up her timbers
3647,I,And the nails are driven to the head;

3686,I,"Why, the glitter when the sun is shining passes belief."

3724,I,"Mr. Nichols clears his throat,"
3725,I,And tells her the launching day is set.
3726,I,"He says, ""Be careful, the paint is wet."""
3727,I,"But Miss Jessie has touched it, her sprigged muslin gown"
3728,I,Has a blood-red streak from the shoulder down.
3729,I,"""It looks like blood,"" says Miss Jessie with a frown."
3730,I,
3731,I,Tap!  Tap!  Rap!
3732,I,"An October day, with waves running in blue-white lines and a capful of wind."
3733,I,Three broad flags ripple out behind

3735,I,"Royal Standard at the main,"
3736,I,"Admiralty flag at the fore,"
3737,I,Union Jack at the mizzen.
3738,I,"The hammers tap harder, faster,"
3739,I,They must finish by noon.
3740,I,The last nail is driven.
3741,I,"But the wind has increased to half a gale,"
3742,I,And the ship shakes and quivers upon the ways.
3743,I,The Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard is coming
3744,I,In his ten-oared barge from the King's Stairs;
3745,I,"The Marine's band will play ""God Save Great George Our King"";"
3746,I,"And there is to be a dinner afterwards at the Crown, with speeches."
3747,I,"The wind screeches, and flaps the flags till they pound like hammers."
3748,I,"The wind hums over the ship,"
3749,I,"And slips round the dog-shores,"
3750,I,Jostling them almost to falling.
3751,I,There is no time now to wait for Commissioners and marine bands.
3752,I,Mr. Nichols has a bottle of port in his hands.
3753,I,"He leans over, holding his hat, and shouts to the men below:"
3754,I,"""Let her go!"""
3755,I,Bang!  Bang!  Pound!
3756,I,"The dog-shores fall to the ground,"
3757,I,And the ship slides down the greased planking.
3758,I,"A splintering of glass,"
3759,I,And port wine running all over the white and copper stem timbers.
3760,I,"""Success to his Majesty's ship, the Bellerophon!"""

3797,II,Glittering each window to a flash.
3798,II,Squeak!  Squeak!  Tap!

3800,II,A Prussian hussar on a grey horse goes by at a dash.
3801,II,"From other shops, the noise of striking blows:"
3802,II,"Pounds, thumps, and whacks;"

3804,II,Paris is full of the galloping of horses and the knocking of hammers.
3805,II,"""Hullo! Friend Martin, is business slack"
3806,II,That you are in the street this morning?  Don't turn your back
3807,II,And scuttle into your shop like a rabbit to its hole.

3809,II,The stinking Cossacks are bivouacked all up and down the Champs Elysees.
3810,II,I can't get the smell of them out of my nostrils.

3915,III,What falls to the ground like a streak of flame?
3916,III,Hush!  It is only a bit of bronze flashing in the sun.
3917,III,What are all those soldiers?  Those are not the uniforms of France.
3918,III,"Alas!  No!  The uniforms of France, Great Imperial France, are done."
3919,III,They will rot away in chests and hang to dusty tatters in barn lofts.
3920,III,These are other armies.  And their name?
3921,III,"Hush, be still for shame;"
3922,III,Be still and imperturbable like the marble arch.
3923,III,Another bright spark falls through the blue air.
3924,III,Over the Place du Carrousel a wailing of despair.
3925,III,"Crowd your horses back upon the people, Uhlans and Hungarian Lancers,"

4237,V,Two-horned hat makes an outline like a bow.

4245,V,"Say, what is the use of him if he doesn't turn?"
4246,V,"Just put up to glitter there, like a torch to burn,"
4247,V,A sort of sacrificial show in a lofty urn?

4250,V,"I'd rather see a Goddess with a spear, I confess."
4251,V,"Something allegorical and fine.  Why, yes--"
4252,V,
4253,V,I cannot take my eyes from him.  I don't know why at all.
4254,V,I've looked so long the whole thing swims.  I feel he ought to fall.
4255,V,Foreshortened there among the clouds he's pitifully small.
4256,V,
4257,V,"What do you say?  There used to be an Emperor standing there,"
4258,V,With flowing robes and laurel crown.  Really?  Yet I declare
4259,V,Those spiral battles round the shaft don't seem just his affair.
4260,V,
4261,V,"A togaed, laurelled man's I mean.  Now this chap seems to feel"
4262,V,"As though he owned those soldiers.  Whew!  How he makes one reel,"
4263,V,Swinging round above his circling armies in a wheel.
4264,V,
4265,V,"Sweeping round the sky in an orbit like the sun's,"
4266,V,Flashing sparks like cannon-balls from his own long guns.
4267,V,"Perhaps my sight is tired, but that figure simply stuns."
4268,V,
4269,V,"How low the houses seem, and all the people are mere flies."

4485,PEACE!,"and they take very long steps on their little green platforms, and from"

4503,PEACE!,Of the proper thing to do
4504,PEACE!,When it's he who is shot through.
4505,PEACE!,"Like a cleverly trained flea,"
4506,PEACE!,He can follow instantly
4507,PEACE!,"Orders, and some quick commands"
4508,PEACE!,Really make severe demands
4509,PEACE!,"On a mind that's none too rapid,"
4510,PEACE!,Leaden brains tend to the vapid.
4511,PEACE!,But how beautifully dressed
4512,PEACE!,Is this army!  How impressed

4514,PEACE!,All his baggage wagons wheel
4515,PEACE!,"About the patterned carpet, and"
4516,PEACE!,Moving up his heavy guns
4517,PEACE!,He sees them glow with diamond suns
4518,PEACE!,Flashing all along each barrel.
4519,PEACE!,And the gold and blue apparel
4520,PEACE!,Of his gunners is a joy.
4521,PEACE!,Tommy is a lucky boy.
4522,PEACE!,Boom!  Boom!  Ta-ra!
4523,PEACE!,
4524,PEACE!,The old mandarin nods under his purple umbrella.  The rose in his hand
4525,PEACE!,shoots its petals up in thin quills of crimson.  Then they collapse and

4532,PEACE!,the infantry on at the double quick.  The tassel of the hearth-rug has
4533,PEACE!,"flung down the bass-drum, and he and his dapple-grey horse lie"
4534,PEACE!,"overtripped, slipped out of line, with the little lead drumsticks"
4535,PEACE!,glistening to the fire's shine.
4536,PEACE!,

4543,PEACE!,"jeers at his impotence, and flaunts the glory of the martial and still"

4553,PEACE!,Every manly bosom stirs
4554,PEACE!,At the thought of killing--killing!
4555,PEACE!,Tommy's dearest wish fulfilling.
4556,PEACE!,"We are gaudy, savage, strong,"
4557,PEACE!,And our loins so ripe we long
4558,PEACE!,"First to kill, then procreate,"
4559,PEACE!,Doubling so the laws of Fate.
4560,PEACE!,On their women we have sworn
4561,PEACE!,To graft our sons.  And overborne
4562,PEACE!,"They'll rear us younger soldiers, so"
4563,PEACE!,"Shall our race endure and grow,"
4564,PEACE!,Waxing greater in the wombs
4565,PEACE!,"Borrowed of them, while damp tombs"

4575,PEACE!,
4576,PEACE!,"The fire strokes them with its dartles, and purrs at them, and the old"

4579,PEACE!,
4580,PEACE!,"Tommy does not hear the song.  He only sees the beautiful, new,"
4581,PEACE!,"gaily-coloured lead soldiers.  They belong to him, and he is very proud"
4582,PEACE!,"and happy.  He shouts his orders aloud, and gallops his cavalry past the"
4583,PEACE!,door to the wash-stand.  He creeps over the floor on his hands and knees
4584,PEACE!,"to one battalion and another, but he sees only the bright colours of his"
4585,PEACE!,soldiers and the beautiful precision of their gestures. He is a lucky
4586,PEACE!,boy to have such fine lead soldiers to enjoy.
4587,PEACE!,
4588,PEACE!,
4589,PEACE!,"Tommy catches his toe in the leg of the wash-stand, and jars the"
4590,PEACE!,"pitcher. He snatches at it with his hands, but it is too late.  The"
4591,PEACE!,"pitcher falls, and as it goes, he sees the white water flow over its"
4592,PEACE!,lip.  It slips between his fingers and crashes to the floor.  But it is
4593,PEACE!,"not water which oozes to the door.  The stain is glutinous and dark, a"
4594,PEACE!,"spark from the firelight heads it to red.  In and out, between the fine,"
4595,PEACE!,"new soldiers, licking over the carpet, squirms the stream of blood,"
4596,PEACE!,"lapping at the little green platforms, and flapping itself against the"

4598,PEACE!,
4599,PEACE!,
4600,PEACE!,"The nodding mandarin moves his head slowly, forward and back. The rose"

4602,PEACE!,"under his purple umbrella, and nods--forward and back, staring into"
4603,PEACE!,the air with blue-green eyes.  Every time his head comes forward a
4604,PEACE!,"rosebud pushes between his lips, rushes into full bloom, and drips to"
4605,PEACE!,the ground with a splashing sound.  The pool of black blood grows and
4606,PEACE!,"grows, with each dropped rose, and spreads out to join the stream from"
4607,PEACE!,the wash-stand.  The beautiful army of lead soldiers steps boldly
4608,PEACE!,"forward, but the little green platforms are covered in the rising stream"

4742,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4743,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4744,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You want to know what's the matter with me, do yer?"
4745,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,My! ain't men blinder'n moles?
4746,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It ain't nothin' new, be sure o' that."
4747,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Why, ef you'd had eyes you'd ha' seed"
4748,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Me changin' under your very nose,"
4749,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Each day a little diff'rent.
4750,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But you never see nothin', you don't."
4751,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Don't touch me, Jake,"
4752,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Don't you dars't to touch me,"
4753,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I ain't in no humour.
4754,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,That's what's come over me;
4755,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Jest a change clear through.
4756,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You lay still, an' I'll tell yer,"
4757,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I've had it on my mind to tell yer
4758,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer some time.
4759,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It's a strain livin' a lie from mornin' till night,"
4760,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I'm goin' to put an end to it right now.
4761,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' don't make any mistake about one thing,"
4762,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,When I married yer I loved yer.
4763,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Why, your voice 'ud make"
4764,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Me go hot and cold all over,"
4765,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' your kisses most stopped my heart from beatin'.
4766,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Lord!  I was a silly fool.
4767,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But that's the way 'twas.
4768,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, I married yer"
4769,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' thought Heav'n was comin'
4770,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,To set on the door-step.
4771,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Heav'n didn't do no settin',"
4772,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Though the first year warn't so bad.
4773,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"The baby's fever threw you off some, I guess,"
4774,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' then I took her death real hard,"
4775,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' a mopey wife kind o' disgusts a man.
4776,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I ain't blamin' yer exactly.
4777,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But that's how 'twas.
4778,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Do lay quiet,"
4779,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I know I'm slow, but it's harder to say 'n I thought."
4780,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,There come a time when I got to be
4781,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,More wife agin than mother.
4782,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The mother part was sort of a waste
4783,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,When we didn't have no other child.
4784,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But you'd got used ter lots o' things,"
4785,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' you was all took up with the farm.
4786,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Many's the time I've laid awake
4787,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Watchin' the moon go clear through the elm-tree,"
4788,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Out o' sight.
4789,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'd foller yer around like a dog,"
4790,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' set in the chair you'd be'n settin' in,"
4791,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Jest to feel its arms around me,"
4792,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,So long's I didn't have yours.
4793,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It preyed on me, I guess,"
4794,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Longin' and longin'
4795,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"While you was busy all day, and snorin' all night."
4796,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Yes, I know you're wide awake now,"
4797,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But now ain't then,"
4798,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I guess you'll think diff'rent
4799,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,When I'm done.
4800,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Do you mind the day you went to Hadrock?
4801,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I didn't want to stay home for reasons,"
4802,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But you said someone 'd have to be here
4803,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Cause Elmer was comin' to see t' th' telephone.
4804,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' you never see why I was so set on goin' with yer,"
4805,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Our married life hadn't be'n any great shakes,"
4806,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Still marriage is marriage, an' I was raised God-fearin'."
4807,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But, Lord, you didn't notice nothin',"
4808,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' Elmer hangin' around all Winter!
4809,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Twas a lovely mornin'.
4810,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The apple-trees was jest elegant
4811,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"With their blossoms all flared out,"
4812,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' there warn't a cloud in the sky.
4813,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You went, you wouldn't pay no 'tention to what I said,"
4814,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I heard the Ford chuggin' for most a mile,"
4815,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The air was so still.
4816,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Then Elmer come.
4817,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It's no use your frettin', Jake,"
4818,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'll tell you all about it.
4819,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I know what I'm doin',"
4820,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' what's worse, I know what I done."
4821,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Elmer fixed th' telephone in about two minits,"
4822,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' he didn't seem in no hurry to go,"
4823,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I don't know as I wanted him to go either,"
4824,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I was awful mad at your not takin' me with yer,"
4825,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I was tired o' wishin' and wishin'
4826,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' gittin' no comfort.
4827,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I guess it ain't necessary to tell yer all the things.
4828,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He stayed to dinner,"
4829,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' he helped me do the dishes,"
4830,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' he said a home was a fine thing,"
4831,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I said dishes warn't a home
4832,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Nor yet the room they're in.
4833,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He said a lot o' things,"
4834,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I fended him off at first,"
4835,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But he got talkin' all around me,"
4836,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Clost up to the things I'd be'n thinkin',"
4837,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"What's the use o' me goin' on, Jake,"
4838,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,You know.
4839,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He got all he wanted,"
4840,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I give it to him,"
4841,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' what's more, I'm glad!"
4842,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I ain't dead, anyway,"
4843,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' somebody thinks I'm somethin'.
4844,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Keep away, Jake,"
4845,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You can kill me to-morrer if you want to,"
4846,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I'm goin' to have my say.
4847,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Funny thing!  Guess I ain't made to hold a man.
4848,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Elmer ain't be'n here for mor'n two months.
4849,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I don't want to pretend nothin',"
4850,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Mebbe if he'd be'n lately
4851,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I shouldn't have told yer.
4852,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'll go away in the mornin', o' course."
4853,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,What you want the light fer?
4854,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I don't look no diff'rent.
4855,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ain't the moon bright enough
4856,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,To look at a woman that's deceived yer by?
4857,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Don't, Jake, don't, you can't love me now!"
4858,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It ain't a question of forgiveness.
4859,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Why!  I'd be thinkin' o' Elmer ev'ry minute;
4860,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It ain't decent.
4861,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, my God!  It ain't decent any more either way!"
4862,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4863,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4864,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4865,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4866,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Off the Turnpike
4867,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4868,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4869,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
4870,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Good ev'nin', Mis' Priest."
4871,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I jest stepped in to tell you Good-bye.
4872,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Yes, it's all over."
4873,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,All my things is packed
4874,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' every last one o' them boxes
4875,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Is on Bradley's team
4876,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Bein' hauled over to th' depot.
4877,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No, I ain't goin' back agin."
4878,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'm stoppin' over to French's fer to-night,"
4879,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And goin' down first train in th' mornin'.
4880,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Yes, it do seem kinder queer"
4881,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Not to be goin' to see Cherry's Orchard no more,"
4882,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But Land Sakes!  When a change's comin',"
4883,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Why, I al'ays say it can't come too quick."
4884,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Now, that's real kind o' you,"
4885,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Your doughnuts is always so tasty.
4886,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Yes, I'm goin' to Chicago,"
4887,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"To my niece,"
4888,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"She's married to a fine man, hardware business,"
4889,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' doin' real well, she tells me."
4890,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Lizzie's be'n at me to go out ther for the longest while.
4891,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"She ain't got no kith nor kin to Chicago, you know"
4892,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"She's rented me a real nice little flat,"
4893,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Same house as hers,"
4894,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I'm goin' to try that city livin' folks say's so pleasant.
4895,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, yes, he was real generous,"
4896,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Paid me a sight o' money fer the Orchard;
4897,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I told him 'twouldn't yield nothin' but stones,"
4898,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But he ain't farmin' it.
4899,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Lor', no, Mis' Priest,"
4900,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He's jest took it to set and look at the view.
4901,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Mebbe he wouldn't be so stuck on the view
4902,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ef he'd seed it every mornin' and night for forty year
4903,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Same's as I have.
4904,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I dessay it's pretty enough,"
4905,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But it's so pressed into me
4906,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I c'n see't with my eyes shut.
4907,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No.  I ain't cold, Mis' Priest,"
4908,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Don't shut th' door.
4909,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'll be all right in a minit.
4910,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I ain't a mite sorry to leave that view.
4911,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, mebbe 'tis queer to feel so,"
4912,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' mebbe 'taint.
4913,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,My!  But that tea's revivin'.
4914,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Old things ain't always pleasant things, Mis' Priest."
4915,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No, no, I don't cal'late on comin' back,"
4916,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That's why I'd ruther be to Chicago,"
4917,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Boston's too near.
4918,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It ain't cold, Mis' Priest,"
4919,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It's jest my thoughts.
4920,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I ain't sick, only--"
4921,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Mis' Priest, ef you've nothin' ter take yer time,"
4922,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' have a mind to listen,"
4923,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ther's somethin' I'd like ter speak about
4924,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I ain't never mentioned it,"
4925,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I'd like to tell yer 'fore I go.
4926,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Would you mind lowerin' them shades,"
4927,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Fall twilight's awful grey,"
4928,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' that fire's real cosy with the shades drawed.
4929,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, I guess folks about here think I've be'n dret'ful onsociable."
4930,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You needn't say 'taint so, 'cause I know diff'rent."
4931,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' what's more, it's true."
4932,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, the reason is I've be'n scared out o' my life."
4933,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Scared ev'ry minit o' th' time, fer eight year."
4934,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Eight mortal year 'tis, come next June."
4935,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"'Twas on the eighteenth o' June,"
4936,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Six months after I'd buried my husband,"
4937,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,That somethin' happened ter me.
4938,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Mebbe you'll mind that afore that
4939,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I was a cheery body.
4940,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Hiram was too,"
4941,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Al'ays liked to ask a neighbor in,"
4942,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' ev'n when he died,"
4943,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Barrin' low sperrits, I warn't averse to seein' nobody."
4944,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But that eighteenth o' June changed ev'rythin'.
4945,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I was doin' most o' th' farmwork myself,"
4946,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"With jest a hired boy, Clarence King, 'twas,"
4947,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Comin' in fer an hour or two.
4948,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, that eighteenth o' June"
4949,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I was goin' round,"
4950,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Lockin' up and seein' to things 'fore I went to bed.
4951,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I was jest steppin' out t' th' barn,"
4952,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Goin' round outside 'stead o' through the shed,"
4953,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Cause there was such a sight o' moonlight
4954,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Somehow or another I thought 'twould be pretty outdoors.
4955,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I got settled for pretty things that night, I guess."
4956,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I ain't stuck on 'em no more.
4957,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, them laylock bushes side o' th' house"
4958,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Was real lovely.
4959,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Glitt'rin' and shakin' in the moonlight,"
4960,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' the smell o' them rose right up
4961,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' most took my breath away.
4962,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"The colour o' the spikes was all faded out,"
4963,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"They never keep their colour when the moon's on 'em,"
4964,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But the smell fair 'toxicated me.
4965,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I was al'ays partial to a sweet scent,"
4966,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I went close up t' th' bushes
4967,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,So's to put my face right into a flower.
4968,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Mis' Priest, jest's I got breathin' in that laylock bloom"
4969,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I saw, layin' right at my feet,"
4970,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,A man's hand!
4971,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It was as white's the side o' th' house,"
4972,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And sparklin' like that lum'nous paint they put on gate-posts.
4973,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I screamed right out,"
4974,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I couldn't help it,"
4975,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I could hear my scream
4976,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Goin' over an' over
4977,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,In that echo be'ind th' barn.
4978,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Hearin' it agin an' agin like that
4979,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Scared me so, I dar'sn't scream any more."
4980,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I jest stood ther,"
4981,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And looked at that hand.
4982,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I thought the echo'd begin to hammer like my heart,"
4983,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But it didn't.
4984,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"There was only th' wind,"
4985,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Sighin' through the laylock leaves,"
4986,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' slappin' 'em up agin the house.
4987,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, I guess I looked at that hand"
4988,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Most ten minits,"
4989,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' it never moved,"
4990,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Jest lay there white as white.
4991,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,After a while I got to thinkin' that o' course
4992,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Twas some drunken tramp over from Redfield.
4993,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That calmed me some,"
4994,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I commenced to think I'd better git him out
4995,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,From under them laylocks.
4996,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I planned to drag him in t' th' barn
4997,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' lock him in ther till Clarence come in th' mornin'.
4998,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I got so mad thinkin' o' that all-fired brazen tramp
4999,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Asleep in my laylocks,"
5000,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I jest stooped down and grabbed th' hand and give it an awful pull.
5001,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Then I bumped right down settin' on the ground.
5002,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Mis' Priest, ther warn't no body come with the hand."
5003,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No, it ain't cold, it's jest that I can't abear thinkin' of it,"
5004,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ev'n now.
5005,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'll take a sip o' tea.
5006,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Thank you, Mis' Priest, that's better."
5007,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'd ruther finish now I've begun.
5008,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Thank you, jest the same."
5009,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I dropped the hand's ef it'd be'n red hot
5010,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Stead o' ice cold.
5011,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer a minit or two I jest laid on that grass
5012,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Pantin'.
5013,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Then I up and run to them laylocks
5014,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' pulled 'em every which way.
5015,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"True es I'm settin' here, Mis' Priest,"
5016,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ther warn't nothin' ther.
5017,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I peeked an' pryed all about 'em,"
5018,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But ther warn't no man ther
5019,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Neither livin' nor dead.
5020,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But the hand was ther all right,"
5021,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Upside down, the way I'd dropped it,"
5022,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And glist'nin' fit to dazzle yer.
5023,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I don't know how I done it,"
5024,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I don't know why I done it,"
5025,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I wanted to git that dret'ful hand out o' sight
5026,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I got in t' th' barn, somehow,"
5027,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' felt roun' till I got a spade.
5028,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I couldn't stop fer a lantern,"
5029,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Besides, the moonlight was bright enough in all conscience."
5030,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Then I scooped that awful thing up in th' spade.
5031,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I had a sight o' trouble doin' it.
5032,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It slid off, and tipped over, and I couldn't bear"
5033,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Ev'n to touch it with my foot to prop it,"
5034,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I done it somehow.
5035,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Then I carried it off be'ind the barn,"
5036,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Clost to an old apple-tree
5037,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Where you couldn't see from the house,"
5038,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I buried it,"
5039,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Good an' deep.
5040,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,
5041,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I don't rec'lect nothin' more o' that night.
5042,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Clarence woke me up in th' mornin',"
5043,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Hollerin' fer me to come down and set th' milk.
5044,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"When he'd gone,"
5045,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I stole roun' to the apple-tree
5046,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And seed the earth all new turned
5047,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Where I left it in my hurry.
5048,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I did a heap o' gardenin'
5049,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,That mornin'.
5050,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I couldn't cut no big sods
5051,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Fear Clarence would notice and ask me what I wanted 'em fer,"
5052,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"So I got teeny bits o' turf here and ther,"
5053,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And no one couldn't tell ther'd be'n any diggin'
5054,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,When I got through.
5055,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"They was awful days after that, Mis' Priest,"
5056,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I used ter go every mornin' and poke about them bushes,"
5057,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' up and down the fence,"
5058,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ter find the body that hand come off of.
5059,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I couldn't never find nothin'.
5060,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'd lay awake nights
5061,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Hearin' them laylocks blowin' and whiskin'.
5062,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,At last I had Clarence cut 'em down
5063,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' make a big bonfire of 'em.
5064,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I told him the smell made me sick,"
5065,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' that warn't no lie,"
5066,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I can't abear the smell on 'em now;
5067,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' no wonder, es you say."
5068,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I fretted somethin' awful 'bout that hand
5069,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I wondered, could it be Hiram's,"
5070,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But folks don't rob graveyards hereabouts.
5071,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Besides, Hiram's hands warn't that awful, starin' white."
5072,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I give up seein' people,"
5073,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I was afeared I'd say somethin'.
5074,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,You know what folks thought o' me
5075,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Better'n I do, I dessay,"
5076,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But mebbe now you'll see I couldn't do nothin' diff'rent.
5077,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But I stuck it out,"
5078,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I warn't goin' to be downed
5079,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"By no loose hand, no matter how it come ther"
5080,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But that ain't the worst, Mis' Priest,"
5081,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Not by a long ways.
5082,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Two year ago, Mr. Densmore made me an offer for Cherry's Orchard."
5083,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, I'd got used to th' thought o' bein' sort o' blighted,"
5084,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I warn't scared no more.
5085,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Lived down my fear, I guess."
5086,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'd kinder got used to th' thought o' that awful night,"
5087,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And I didn't mope much about it.
5088,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Only I never went out o' doors by moonlight;
5089,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,That stuck.
5090,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, when Mr. Densmore's offer come,"
5091,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I started thinkin' 'bout the place
5092,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' all the things that had gone on ther.
5093,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Thinks I, I guess I'll go and see where I put the hand."
5094,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I was foolhardy with the long time that had gone by.
5095,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I know'd the place real well,"
5096,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer I'd put it right in between two o' the apple roots.
5097,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I don't know what possessed me, Mis' Priest,"
5098,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I kinder wanted to know
5099,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That the hand had been flesh and bone, anyway."
5100,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It had sorter bothered me, thinkin' I might ha' imagined it."
5101,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I took a mornin' when the sun was real pleasant and warm;
5102,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I guessed I wouldn't jump for a few old bones.
5103,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But I did jump, somethin' wicked."
5104,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ther warn't no bones!
5105,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ther warn't nothin'!
5106,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Not ev'n the gold ring I'd minded bein' on the little finger.
5107,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I don't know ef ther ever was anythin'.
5108,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I've worried myself sick over it.
5109,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I be'n diggin' and diggin' day in and day out
5110,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Till Clarence ketched me at it.
5111,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, I know'd real well what you all thought,"
5112,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I ain't sayin' you're not right,"
5113,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I ain't goin' to end in no county 'sylum
5114,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,If I c'n help it.
5115,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The shiv'rin' fits come on me sudden like.
5116,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I know 'em, don't you trouble."
5117,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I've fretted considerable about the 'sylum,"
5118,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I guess I be'n frettin' all the time I ain't be'n diggin'.
5119,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But anyhow I can't dig to Chicago, can I?"
5120,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Thank you, Mis' Priest,"
5121,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'm better now.  I only dropped in in passin'.
5122,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'll jest be steppin' along down to French's.
5123,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No, I won't be seein' nobody in the mornin',"
5124,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It's a pretty early start.
5125,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Don't you stand ther, Mis' Priest,"
5126,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"The wind'll blow yer lamp out,"
5127,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I c'n see easy, I got aholt o' the gate now."
5128,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I ain't a mite tired, thank you."

5367,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I don't want none.
5368,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I want a bolt o' lightnin'
5369,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,To strike me dead right now!
5370,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, I'll tell yer."
5371,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But it won't make no diff'rence.
5372,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Nothin' will.
5373,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Yes, I killed him."
5374,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Why do yer make me say it?
5375,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It's cruel!  Cruel!
5376,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I killed him because o' th' silence.
5377,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"The long, long silence,"
5378,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That watched all around me,"
5379,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And he wouldn't break it.
5380,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I tried to make him,"
5381,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Time an' agin,"
5382,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But he was terrible taciturn, Ed was."
5383,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He never spoke 'cept when he had to,"
5384,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' then he'd only say ""yes"" and ""no""."
5385,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,You can't even guess what that silence was.
5386,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'd hear it whisperin' in my ears,"
5387,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I got frightened, 'twas so thick,"
5388,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' al'ays comin' back.
5389,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ef Ed would ha' talked sometimes
5390,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It would ha' driven it away;
5391,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But he never would.
5392,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He didn't hear it same as I did.
5393,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"You see, Sir,"
5394,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Our farm was off'n the main road,"
5395,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And set away back under the mountain;
5396,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"And the village was seven mile off,"
5397,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Measurin' after you'd got out o' our lane.
5398,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"We didn't have no hired man,"
5399,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,'Cept in hayin' time;
5400,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' Dane's place,"
5401,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That was the nearest,"
5402,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Was clear way 'tother side the mountain.
5403,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,They used Marley post-office
5404,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' ours was Benton.
5405,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Ther was a cart-track took yer to Dane's in Summer,"
5406,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' it warn't above two mile that way,"
5407,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But it warn't never broke out Winters.
5408,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I used to dread the Winters.
5409,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Seem's ef I couldn't abear to see the golden-rod bloomin';
5410,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Winter'd come so quick after that.
5411,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,You don't know what snow's like when yer with it
5412,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Day in an' day out.
5413,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Ed would be out all day loggin',"
5414,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I set at home and look at the snow
5415,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Layin' over everythin';
5416,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It 'ud dazzle me blind,"
5417,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Till it warn't white any more, but black as ink."
5418,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Then the quiet 'ud commence rushin' past my ears
5419,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Till I most went mad listenin' to it.
5420,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Many's the time I've dropped a pan on the floor
5421,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Jest to hear it clatter.
5422,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I was most frantic when dinner-time come
5423,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' Ed was back from the woods.
5424,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'd ha' give my soul to hear him speak.
5425,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But he'd never say a word till I asked him
5426,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Did he like the raised biscuits or whatever,"
5427,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' then sometimes he'd jest nod his answer.
5428,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Then he'd go out agin,"
5429,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I'd watch him from the kitchin winder.
5430,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It seemed the woods come marchin' out to meet him
5431,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' the trees 'ud press round him an' hustle him.
5432,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I got so I was scared o' th' trees.
5433,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I thought they come nearer,"
5434,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Every day a little nearer,"
5435,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Closin' up round the house.
5436,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I never went in t' th' woods Winters,"
5437,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Though in Summer I liked 'em well enough.
5438,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It warn't so bad when my little boy was with us.
5439,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He used to go sleddin' and skatin',"
5440,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' every day his father fetched him to school in the pung
5441,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' brought him back agin.
5442,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"We scraped an' scraped fer Neddy,"
5443,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,We wanted him to have a education.
5444,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"We sent him to High School,"
5445,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' then he went up to Boston to Technology.
5446,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He was a minin' engineer,"
5447,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' doin' real well,"
5448,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,A credit to his bringin' up.
5449,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But his very first position ther was an explosion in the mine.
5450,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,And I'm glad!  I'm glad!
5451,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He ain't here to see me now.
5452,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Neddy!  Neddy!
5453,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'm your mother still, Neddy."
5454,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Don't turn from me like that.
5455,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I can't abear it.  I can't!  I can't!
5456,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,What did you say?
5457,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, yes, Sir."
5458,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'm here.
5459,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'm very sorry,"
5460,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I don't know what I'm sayin'.
5461,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"No, Sir,"
5462,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Not till after Neddy died.
5463,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"'Twas the next Winter the silence come,"
5464,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I don't remember noticin' it afore.
5465,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"That was five year ago,"
5466,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' it's been gittin' worse an' worse.
5467,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I asked Ed to put in a telephone.
5468,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I thought ef I felt the whisperin' comin' on
5469,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I could ring up some o' th' folks.
5470,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But Ed wouldn't hear of it.
5471,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He said we'd paid so much for Neddy
5472,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,We couldn't hardly git along as 'twas.
5473,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' he never understood me wantin' to talk.
5474,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, this year was worse'n all the others;"
5475,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"We had a terrible spell o' stormy weather,"
5476,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' the snow lay so thick
5477,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,You couldn't see the fences even.
5478,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Out o' doors was as flat as the palm o' my hand,"
5479,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ther warn't a hump or a holler
5480,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer as you could see.
5481,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It was so quiet
5482,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The snappin' o' the branches back in the wood-lot
5483,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Sounded like pistol shots.
5484,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Ed was out all day
5485,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Same as usual.
5486,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' it seemed he talked less'n ever.
5487,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"He didn't even say 'Good-mornin'', once or twice,"
5488,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' jest nodded or shook his head when I asked him things.
5489,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,On Monday he said he'd got to go over to Benton
5490,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer some oats.
5491,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'd oughter ha' gone with him,"
5492,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But 'twas washin' day
5493,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I was afeared the fine weather'd break,"
5494,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I couldn't do my dryin'.
5495,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"All my life I'd done my work punctual,"
5496,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I couldn't fix my conscience
5497,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,To go junketin' on a washin'-day.
5498,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I can't tell you what that day was to me.
5499,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It dragged an' dragged,"
5500,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer ther warn't no Ed ter break it in the middle
5501,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Fer dinner.
5502,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Every time I stopped stirrin' the water
5503,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I heerd the whisperin' all about me.
5504,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I stopped oftener'n I should
5505,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"To see ef 'twas still ther,"
5506,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' it al'ays was.
5507,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' gittin' louder
5508,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,It seemed ter me.
5509,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Once I threw up the winder to feel the wind.
5510,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,That seemed most alive somehow.
5511,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But the woods looked so kind of menacin'
5512,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I closed it quick
5513,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' started to mangle's hard's I could,"
5514,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,The squeakin' was comfortin'.
5515,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Well, Ed come home 'bout four."
5516,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I seen him down the road,"
5517,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I run out through the shed inter th' barn
5518,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,To meet him quicker.
5519,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I hollered out, 'Hullo!'"
5520,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"But he didn't say nothin',"
5521,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He jest drove right in
5522,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' climbed out o' th' sleigh
5523,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' commenced unharnessin'.
5524,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I asked him a heap o' questions;
5525,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Who he'd seed
5526,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' what he'd done.
5527,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Once in a while he'd nod or shake,"
5528,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But most o' th' time he didn't do nothin'.
5529,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"'Twas gittin' dark then,"
5530,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"An' I was in a state,"
5531,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,With the loneliness
5532,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' Ed payin' no attention
5533,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Like somethin' warn't livin'.
5534,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"All of a sudden it come,"
5535,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I don't know what,"
5536,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,But I jest couldn't stand no more.
5537,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"It didn't seem 's though that was Ed,"
5538,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' it didn't seem as though I was me.
5539,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I had to break a way out somehow,"
5540,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Somethin' was closin' in
5541,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I was stiflin'.
5542,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Ed's loggin' axe was ther,"
5543,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I took it.
5544,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, my God!"
5545,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I can't see nothin' else afore me all the time.
5546,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I run out inter th' woods,"
5547,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Seemed as ef they was pullin' me;
5548,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' all the time I was wadin' through the snow
5549,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I seed Ed in front of me
5550,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Where I'd laid him.
5551,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,An' I see him now.
5552,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,There!  There!
5553,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,What you holdin' me fer?
5554,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I want ter go to Ed,"
5555,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,He's bleedin'.
5556,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,Stop holdin' me.
5557,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I got to go.
5558,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"I'm comin', Ed."
5559,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,I'll be ther in a minit.
5560,THE OVERGROWN PASTURE,"Oh, I'm so tired!"

5575,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5576,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5577,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5578,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It was a gusty night,"
5579,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With the wind booming, and swooping,"
5580,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Looping round corners,"
5581,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Sliding over the cobble-stones,"
5582,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Whipping and veering,"
5583,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And careering over the roofs
5584,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Like a thousand clattering horses.
5585,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Mr. Spruggins had been dining in the city,"
5586,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Mr. Spruggins was none too steady in his gait,"
5587,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And the wind played ball with Mr. Spruggins
5588,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And laughed as it whistled past him.
5589,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It rolled him along the street,"
5590,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With his little feet pit-a-patting on the flags of the sidewalk,"
5591,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And his muffler and his coat-tails blown straight out behind him.
5592,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It bumped him against area railings,"
5593,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And chuckled in his ear when he said ""Ouch!"""
5594,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Sometimes it lifted him clear off his little patting feet
5595,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And bore him in triumph over three grey flagstones and a quarter.
5596,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The moon dodged in and out of clouds, winking."
5597,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It was all very unpleasant for Mr. Spruggins,"
5598,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And when the wind flung him hard against his own front door
5599,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It was a relief,"
5600,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Although the breath was quite knocked out of him.
5601,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The gas-lamp in front of the house flared up,"
5602,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And the keyhole was as big as a barn door;
5603,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The gas-lamp flickered away to a sputtering blue star,"
5604,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And the keyhole went out with it.
5605,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Such a stabbing, and jabbing,"
5606,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And sticking, and picking,"
5607,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And poking, and pushing, and prying"
5608,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,With that key;
5609,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And there is no denying that Mr. Spruggins rapped out an oath or two,"
5610,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Rub-a-dub-dubbing them out to a real snare-drum roll.
5611,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"But the door opened at last,"
5612,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And Mr. Spruggins blew through it into his own hall
5613,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And slammed the door to so hard
5614,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,That the knocker banged five times before it stopped.
5615,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Mr. Spruggins struck a light and lit a candle,"
5616,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And all the time the moon winked at him through the window.
5617,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""Why couldn't you find the keyhole, Spruggins?"""
5618,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Taunted the wind.
5619,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""I can find the keyhole."""
5620,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And the wind, thin as a wire,"
5621,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Darted in and seized the candle flame
5622,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And knocked it over to one side
5623,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And pummelled it down--down--down--!
5624,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"But Mr. Spruggins held the candle so close that it singed his chin,"
5625,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And ran and stumbled up the stairs in a surprisingly agile manner,"
5626,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"For the wind through the keyhole kept saying, ""Spruggins!  Spruggins!"""
5627,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,behind him.
5628,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The fire in his bedroom burned brightly.
5629,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The room with its crimson bed and window curtains
5630,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Was as red and glowing as a carbuncle.
5631,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,It was still and warm.
5632,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"There was no wind here, for the windows were fastened;"
5633,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And no moon,"
5634,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,For the curtains were drawn.
5635,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The candle flame stood up like a pointed pear
5636,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,In a wide brass dish.
5637,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Mr. Spruggins sighed with content;
5638,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He was safe at home.
5639,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The fire glowed--red and yellow roses
5640,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,In the black basket of the grate--
5641,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And the bed with its crimson hangings
5642,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Seemed a great peony,"
5643,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Wide open and placid.
5644,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Mr. Spruggins slipped off his top-coat and his muffler.
5645,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He slipped off his bottle-green coat
5646,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And his flowered waistcoat.
5647,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He put on a flannel dressing-gown,"
5648,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And tied a peaked night-cap under his chin.
5649,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He wound his large gold watch
5650,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And placed it under his pillow.
5651,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Then he tiptoed over to the window and pulled back the curtain.
5652,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,There was the moon dodging in and out of the clouds;
5653,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,But behind him was his quiet candle.
5654,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,There was the wind whisking along the street.
5655,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The window rattled, but it was fastened."
5656,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Did the wind say, ""Spruggins""?"
5657,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"All Mr. Spruggins heard was ""S-s-s-s-s--"""
5658,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Dying away down the street.
5659,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He dropped the curtain and got into bed.
5660,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Martha had been in the last thing with the warming-pan;
5661,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The bed was warm,"
5662,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And Mr. Spruggins sank into feathers,"
5663,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,With the familiar ticking of his watch just under his head.
5664,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Mr. Spruggins dozed.
5665,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He had forgotten to put out the candle,"
5666,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,But it did not make much difference as the fire was so bright...
5667,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Too bright!
5668,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The red and yellow roses pricked his eyelids,"
5669,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,They scorched him back to consciousness.
5670,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He tried to shift his position;
5671,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He could not move.
5672,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Something weighed him down,"
5673,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He could not breathe.
5674,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He was gasping,"
5675,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Pinned down and suffocating.
5676,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He opened his eyes.
5677,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The curtains of the window were flung back,"
5678,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The fire and the candle were out,"
5679,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And the room was filled with green moonlight.
5680,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And pressed against the window-pane
5681,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Was a wide, round face,"
5682,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Winking--winking--
5683,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Solemnly dropping one eyelid after the other.
5684,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Tick--tock--went the watch under his pillow,"
5685,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Wink--wink--went the face at the window.
5686,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It was not the fire roses which had pricked him,"
5687,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,It was the winking eyes.
5688,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Mr. Spruggins tried to bounce up;
5689,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He could not, because--"
5690,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,His heart flapped up into his mouth
5691,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And fell back dead.
5692,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"On his chest was a fat pink pig,"
5693,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,On the pig a blackamoor
5694,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,With a ten pound weight for a cap.
5695,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"His mustachios kept curling up and down like angry snakes,"
5696,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And his eyes rolled round and round,"
5697,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With the pupils coming into sight, and disappearing,"
5698,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And appearing again on the other side.
5699,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The holsters at his saddle-bow were two port bottles,"
5700,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And a curved table-knife hung at his belt for a scimitar,"
5701,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,While a fork and a keg of spirits were strapped to the saddle behind.
5702,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He dug his spurs into the pig,"
5703,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Which trampled and snorted,"
5704,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And stamped its cloven feet deeper into Mr. Spruggins.
5705,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Then the green light on the floor began to undulate.
5706,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It heaved and hollowed,"
5707,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It rose like a tide,"
5708,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Sea-green,"
5709,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Full of claws and scales
5710,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And wriggles.
5711,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The air above his bed began to move;
5712,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,It weighed over him
5713,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,In a mass of draggled feathers.
5714,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Not one lifted to stir the air.
5715,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,They drooped and dripped
5716,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With a smell of port wine and brandy,"
5717,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Closing down, slowly,"
5718,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Trickling drops on the bed-quilt.
5719,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Suddenly the window fell in with a great scatter of glass,"
5720,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And the moon burst into the room,"
5721,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Sizzling--""S-s-s-s-s--Spruggins!  Spruggins!"""
5722,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It rolled toward him,"
5723,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A green ball of flame,"
5724,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With two eyes in the center,"
5725,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A red eye and a yellow eye,"
5726,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Dropping their lids slowly,"
5727,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,One after the other.
5728,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Mr. Spruggins tried to scream,"
5729,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,But the blackamoor
5730,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Leapt off his pig
5731,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With a cry,"
5732,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Drew his scimitar,"
5733,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And plunged it into Mr. Spruggins's mouth.
5734,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5735,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Mr. Spruggins got up in the cold dawn
5736,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And remade the fire.
5737,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Then he crept back to bed
5738,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"By the light which seeped in under the window curtains,"
5739,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And lay there, shivering,"
5740,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,While the bells of St. George the Martyr chimed the quarter after seven.
5741,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5742,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5743,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5744,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5745,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The Paper Windmill
5746,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5747,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5748,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5749,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The little boy pressed his face against the window-pane and looked out
5750,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,at the bright sunshiny morning.  The cobble-stones of the square
5751,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"glistened like mica.  In the trees, a breeze danced and pranced, and"
5752,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,shook drops of sunlight like falling golden coins into the brown water
5753,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,of the canal.  Down stream slowly drifted a long string of galliots
5754,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,piled with crimson cheeses.  The little boy thought they looked as if
5755,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"they were roc's eggs, blocks of big ruby eggs.  He said, ""Oh!"" with"
5756,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"delight, and pressed against the window with all his might."
5757,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5758,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5759,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The golden cock on the top of the 'Stadhuis' gleamed.  His beak was open
5760,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,like a pair of scissors and a narrow piece of blue sky was wedged in it.
5761,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""Cock-a-doodle-do,"" cried the little boy.  ""Can't you hear me through"
5762,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"the window, Gold Cocky?  Cock-a-doodle-do!  You should crow when you see"
5763,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"the eggs of your cousin, the great roc.""  But the golden cock stood"
5764,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"stock still, with his fine tail blowing in the wind. He could not"
5765,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"understand the little boy, for he said ""Cocorico"" when he said anything."
5766,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"But he was hung in the air to swing, not to sing. His eyes glittered to"
5767,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"the bright West wind, and the crimson cheeses drifted away down the"
5768,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,canal.
5769,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5770,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5771,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It was very dull there in the big room.  Outside in the square, the wind"
5772,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"was playing tag with some fallen leaves.  A man passed, with a dogcart"
5773,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"beside him full of smart, new milkcans.  They rattled out a gay tune:"
5774,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""Tiddity-tum-ti-ti.  Have some milk for your tea.  Cream for your coffee"
5775,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"to drink to-night, thick, and smooth, and sweet, and white,"" and the"
5776,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"man's sabots beat an accompaniment:  ""Plop! trop! milk for your tea."
5777,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Plop! trop! drink it to-night.""  It was very pleasant out there, but it"
5778,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,was lonely here in the big room.  The little boy gulped at a tear.
5779,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5780,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5781,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,It was queer how dull all his toys were.  They were so still. Nothing
5782,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,was still in the square.  If he took his eyes away a moment it had
5783,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"changed.  The milkman had disappeared round the corner, there was only"
5784,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"an old woman with a basket of green stuff on her head, picking her way"
5785,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,over the shiny stones.  But the wind pulled the leaves in the basket
5786,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"this way and that, and displayed them to beautiful advantage. The sun"
5787,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"patted them condescendingly on their flat surfaces, and they seemed"
5788,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,sprinkled with silver.  The little boy sighed as he looked at his
5789,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"disordered toys on the floor.  They were motionless, and their colours"
5790,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,were dull. The dark wainscoting absorbed the sun.  There was none left
5791,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,for toys.
5792,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5793,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5794,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The square was quite empty now.  Only the wind ran round and round it,"
5795,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,spinning.  Away over in the corner where a street opened into the
5796,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"square, the wind had stopped.  Stopped running, that is, for it never"
5797,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"stopped spinning.  It whirred, and whirled, and gyrated, and turned. It"
5798,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"burned like a great coloured sun.  It hummed, and buzzed, and sparked,"
5799,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"and darted.  There were flashes of blue, and long smearing lines of"
5800,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"saffron, and quick jabs of green.  And over it all was a sheen like a"
5801,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"myriad cut diamonds.  Round and round it went, the huge wind-wheel, and"
5802,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,the little boy's head reeled with watching it.  The whole square was
5803,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"filled with its rays, blazing and leaping round after one another,"
5804,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"faster and faster.  The little boy could not speak, he could only gaze,"
5805,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,staring in amaze.
5806,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5807,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5808,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The wind-wheel was coming down the square.  Nearer and nearer it came, a"
5809,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"great disk of spinning flame.  It was opposite the window now, and the"
5810,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"little boy could see it plainly, but it was something more than the wind"
5811,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,which he saw.  A man was carrying a huge fan-shaped frame on his
5812,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"shoulder, and stuck in it were many little painted paper windmills, each"
5813,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"one scurrying round in the breeze.  They were bright and beautiful, and"
5814,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"the sight was one to please anybody, and how much more a little boy who"
5815,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"had only stupid, motionless toys to enjoy."
5816,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5817,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5818,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The little boy clapped his hands, and his eyes danced and whizzed, for"
5819,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,the circling windmills made him dizzy.  Closer and closer came the
5820,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"windmill man, and held up his big fan to the little boy in the window of"
5821,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,the Ambassador's house.  Only a pane of glass between the boy and the
5822,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,windmills.  They slid round before his eyes in rapidly revolving
5823,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"splendour.  There were wheels and wheels of colours--big, little,"
5824,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"thick, thin--all one clear, perfect spin.  The windmill vendor dipped"
5825,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"and raised them again, and the little boy's face was glued to the"
5826,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"window-pane.  Oh!  What a glorious, wonderful plaything! Rings and rings"
5827,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,of windy colour always moving!  How had any one ever preferred those
5828,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"other toys which never stirred.  ""Nursie, come quickly.  Look! I want a"
5829,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"windmill.  See!  It is never still.  You will buy me one, won't you? I"
5830,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"want that silver one, with the big ring of blue."""
5831,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5832,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5833,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"So a servant was sent to buy that one:  silver, ringed with blue, and"
5834,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,smartly it twirled about in the servant's hands as he stood a moment to
5835,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"pay the vendor.  Then he entered the house, and in another minute he was"
5836,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"standing in the nursery door, with some crumpled paper on the end of a"
5837,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"stick which he held out to the little boy.  ""But I wanted a windmill"
5838,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"which went round,"" cried the little boy.  ""That is the one you asked"
5839,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"for, Master Charles,"" Nursie was a bit impatient, she had mending to do."
5840,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""See, it is silver, and here is the blue.""  ""But it is only a blue"
5841,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"streak,"" sobbed the little boy.  ""I wanted a blue ring, and this silver"
5842,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"doesn't sparkle.""  ""Well, Master Charles, that is what you wanted, now"
5843,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"run away and play with it, for I am very busy."""
5844,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5845,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5846,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The little boy hid his tears against the friendly window-pane.  On the
5847,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"floor lay the motionless, crumpled bit of paper on the end of its stick."
5848,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"But far away across the square was the windmill vendor, with his big"
5849,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,wheel of whirring splendour.  It spun round in a blaze like a whirling
5850,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"rainbow, and the sun gleamed upon it, and the wind whipped it, until it"
5851,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"seemed a maze of spattering diamonds.  ""Cocorico!"" crowed the golden"
5852,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"cock on the top of the 'Stadhuis'.  ""That is something worth crowing"
5853,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"for."" But the little boy did not hear him, he was sobbing over the"
5854,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,crumpled bit of paper on the floor.
5855,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5856,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5857,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5858,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5859,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The Red Lacquer Music-Stand
5860,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5861,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5862,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5863,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A music-stand of crimson lacquer, long since brought"
5864,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"In some fast clipper-ship from China, quaintly wrought"
5865,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With bossed and carven flowers and fruits in blackening gold,"
5866,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The slender shaft all twined about and thickly scrolled
5867,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With vine leaves and young twisted tendrils, whirling, curling,"
5868,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Flinging their new shoots over the four wings, and swirling"
5869,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Out on the three wide feet in golden lumps and streams;
5870,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Petals and apples in high relief, and where the seams"
5871,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Are worn with handling, through the polished crimson sheen,"
5872,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Long streaks of black, the under lacquer, shine out clean."
5873,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Four desks, adjustable, to suit the heights of players"
5874,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Sitting to viols or standing up to sing, four layers"
5875,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of music to serve every instrument, are there,"
5876,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And on the apex a large flat-topped golden pear.
5877,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It burns in red and yellow, dusty, smouldering lights,"
5878,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,When the sun flares the old barn-chamber with its flights
5879,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And skips upon the crystal knobs of dim sideboards,"
5880,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Legless and mouldy, and hops, glint to glint, on hoards"
5881,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of scythes, and spades, and dinner-horns, so the old tools"
5882,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Are little candles throwing brightness round in pools.
5883,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With Oriental splendour, red and gold, the dust"
5884,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Covering its flames like smoke and thinning as a gust
5885,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range,"
5886,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The strange old music-stand seems to strike out and change;
5887,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,To stroke and tear the darkness with sharp golden claws;
5888,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"To dart a forked, vermilion tongue from open jaws;"
5889,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,To puff out bitter smoke which chokes the sun; and fade
5890,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Back to a still, faint outline obliterate in shade."
5891,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Creeping up the ladder into the loft, the Boy"
5892,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Stands watching, very still, prickly and hot with joy."
5893,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He sees the dusty sun-mote slit by streaks of red,"
5894,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He sees it split and stream, and all about his head"
5895,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Spikes and spears of gold are licking, pricking, flicking,"
5896,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Scratching against the walls and furniture, and nicking"
5897,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The darkness into sparks, chipping away the gloom."
5898,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The Boy's nose smarts with the pungence in the room.
5899,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The wind pushes an elm branch from before the door
5900,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And the sun widens out all along the floor,"
5901,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Filling the barn-chamber with white, straightforward light,"
5902,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,So not one blurred outline can tease the mind to fright.
5903,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5904,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"""O All ye Works of the Lord, Bless ye the Lord; Praise Him, and Magnify Him"

5912,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5913,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The Boy will praise his God on an altar builded fair,"
5914,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Will heap it with the Works of the Lord.  In the morning air,"
5915,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Spices shall burn on it, and by their pale smoke curled,"
5916,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Like shoots of all the Green Things, the God of this bright World"
5917,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Shall see the Boy's desire to pay his debt of praise.
5918,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The Boy turns round about, seeking with careful gaze"
5919,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"An altar meet and worthy, but each table and chair"
5920,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Has some defect, each piece is needing some repair"
5921,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"To perfect it; the chairs have broken legs and backs,"
5922,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The tables are uneven, and every highboy lacks"
5923,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A handle or a drawer, the desks are bruised and worn,"
5924,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And even a wide sofa has its cane seat torn.
5925,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Only in the gloom far in the corner there
5926,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The lacquer music-stand is elegant and rare,"
5927,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Clear and slim of line, with its four wings outspread,"
5928,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The sound of old quartets, a tenuous, faint thread,"
5929,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Hanging and floating over it, it stands supreme--"
5930,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Black, and gold, and crimson, in one twisted scheme!"
5931,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5932,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A candle on the bookcase feels a draught and wavers,"
5933,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Stippling the white-washed walls with dancing shades and quavers.
5934,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A bed-post, grown colossal, jigs about the ceiling,"
5935,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And shadows, strangely altered, stain the walls, revealing"
5936,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Eagles, and rabbits, and weird faces pulled awry,"
5937,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And hands which fetch and carry things incessantly.
5938,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Under the Eastern window, where the morning sun"
5939,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Must touch it, stands the music-stand, and on each one"
5940,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of its broad platforms is a pyramid of stones,"
5941,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And metals, and dried flowers, and pine and hemlock cones,"
5942,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"An oriole's nest with the four eggs neatly blown,"
5943,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The rattle of a rattlesnake, and three large brown"
5944,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Butternuts uncracked, six butterflies impaled"
5945,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"With a green luna moth, a snake-skin freshly scaled,"
5946,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Some sunflower seeds, wampum, and a bloody-tooth shell,"
5947,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A blue jay feather, all together piled pell-mell"
5948,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The stand will hold no more.  The Boy with humming head
5949,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Looks once again, blows out the light, and creeps to bed."
5950,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5951,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The Boy keeps solemn vigil, while outside the wind"
5952,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Blows gustily and clear, and slaps against the blind."
5953,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He hardly tries to sleep, so sharp his ecstasy"
5954,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"It burns his soul to emptiness, and sets it free"
5955,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"For adoration only, for worship.  Dedicate,"
5956,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,His unsheathed soul is naked in its novitiate.
5957,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The hours strike below from the clock on the stair.
5958,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The Boy is a white flame suspiring in prayer.
5959,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Morning will bring the sun, the Golden Eye of Him"
5960,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Whose splendour must be veiled by starry cherubim,"
5961,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Whose Feet shimmer like crystal in the streets of Heaven.
5962,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Like an open rose the sun will stand up even,"
5963,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Fronting the window-sill, and when the casement glows"
5964,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Rose-red with the new-blown morning, then the fire which flows"
5965,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,From the sun will fall upon the altar and ignite
5966,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The spices, and his sacrifice will burn in perfumed light."
5967,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Over the music-stand the ghosts of sounds will swim,"
5968,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,'Viols d'amore' and 'hautbois' accorded to a hymn.
5969,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The Boy will see the faintest breath of angels' wings
5970,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Fanning the smoke, and voices will flower through the strings."
5971,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He dares no farther vision, and with scalding eyes"
5972,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Waits upon the daylight and his great emprise.
5973,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
5974,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The cold, grey light of dawn was whitening the wall"
5975,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"When the Boy, fine-drawn by sleeplessness, started his ritual."
5976,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He washed, all shivering and pointed like a flame."
5977,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He threw the shutters open, and in the window-frame"
5978,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,The morning glimmered like a tarnished Venice glass.
5979,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He took his Chinese pastilles and put them in a mass
5980,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Upon the mantelpiece till he could seek a plate
5981,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Worthy to hold them burning.  Alas!  He had been late
5982,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"In thinking of this need, and now he could not find"
5983,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Platter or saucer rare enough to ease his mind.
5984,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The house was not astir, and he dared not go down"
5985,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Into the barn-chamber, lest some door should be blown"
5986,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,And slam before the draught he made as he went out.
5987,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The light was growing yellower, and still he looked about."
5988,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,A flash of almost crimson from the gilded pear
5989,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Upon the music-stand, startled him waiting there."
5990,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The sun would rise and he would meet it unprepared,"
5991,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Labelled a fool in having missed what he had dared.
5992,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"He ran across the room, took his pastilles and laid"
5993,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Them on the flat-topped pear, most carefully displayed"
5994,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"To light with ease, then stood a little to one side,"
5995,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Focussed a burning-glass and painstakingly tried
5996,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,To hold it angled so the bunched and prismed rays
5997,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Should leap upon each other and spring into a blaze.
5998,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Sharp as a wheeling edge of disked, carnation flame,"
5999,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Gem-hard and cutting upward, slowly the round sun came."
6000,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The arrowed fire caught the burning-glass and glanced,"
6001,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Split to a multitude of pointed spears, and lanced,"
6002,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A deeper, hotter flame, it took the incense pile"
6003,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Which welcomed it and broke into a little smile
6004,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of yellow flamelets, creeping, crackling, thrusting up,"
6005,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A golden, red-slashed lily in a lacquer cup."

6015,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
6016,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A moment so it hung, wide-curved, bright-petalled, seeming"
6017,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,A chalice foamed with sunrise.  The Boy woke from his dreaming.
6018,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"A spike of flame had caught the card of butterflies,"
6019,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The oriole's nest took fire, soon all four galleries"
6020,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Where he had spread his treasures were become one tongue
6021,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Of gleaming, brutal fire.  The Boy instantly swung"
6022,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,His pitcher off the wash-stand and turned it upside down.
6023,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"The flames drooped back and sizzled, and all his senses grown"
6024,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Acute by fear, the Boy grabbed the quilt from his bed"
6025,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"And flung it over all, and then with aching head"
6026,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,He watched the early sunshine glint on the remains
6027,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Of his holy offering.  The lacquer stand had stains

6104,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Whoop!  The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time.
6105,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,Whoop!  And a man's hat careers down the street in front of the white

6120,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"the windows of chemists' shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars,"
6121,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"darting colours far into the crowd.  Loud bangs and tremors, murmurings"
6122,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and"
6123,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"motors.  A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the"

6125,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd."
6126,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"Proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet.  Feet tripping,"

6139,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"along the shop fronts, following each other.  They grow, and grow, and"
6140,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades.  Trades scream in

6142,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"new play; and over the way:  plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver"

6145,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours?"
6146,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
6147,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,I leave the city with speed.  Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees
6148,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,and my quietness.  The breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and
6149,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"clean, it has come but recently from the high sky.  There are no flowers"
6150,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus."
6151,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,
6152,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,My room is tranquil and friendly.  Out of the window I can see the

6164,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses"
6165,CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY,"down marble stairways.  Pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the"

6424,II,Ivory shadows
6425,II,Over the pavement
6426,II,Polished to cream surfaces
6427,II,By constant sweeping.
6428,II,The big room is coloured like the petals
6429,II,"Of a great magnolia,"
6430,II,And has a patina
6431,II,Of flower bloom
6432,II,Which makes it shine dimly
6433,II,Under the electric lamps.
6434,II,Chairs are ranged in rows
6435,II,Like sepia seeds
6436,II,Waiting fulfilment.
6437,II,The chalk-white spot of a cook's cap
6438,II,Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall--
6439,II,Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow
6440,II,Through the wavering uncertainty of steam.
6441,II,"Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections,"
6442,II,"Ice-green carboys, shifting--greener, bluer--with the jar of moving water."
6443,II,Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass
6444,II,Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar
6445,II,Above the lighthouse-shaped castors
6446,II,Of grey pepper and grey-white salt.
6447,II,"Grey-white placards:  ""Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters"":"
6448,II,Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines.
6449,II,Dropping on the white counter like horn notes
6450,II,"Through a web of violins,"
6451,II,"The flat yellow lights of oranges,"
6452,II,"The cube-red splashes of apples,"
6453,II,In high plated 'epergnes'.

6458,II,A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair.
6459,II,Two rice puddings and a salmon salad
6460,II,Are pushed over the counter;
6461,II,The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them.
6462,II,"A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone,"

6477,III,"Gold carving edges the balconies,"
6478,III,"Rims the boxes,"
6479,III,Runs up and down fluted pillars.
6480,III,Little knife-stabs of gold
6481,III,Shine out whenever a box door is opened.
6482,III,Gold clusters
6483,III,Flash in soft explosions
6484,III,"On the blue darkness,"
6485,III,"Suck back to a point,"
6486,III,And disappear.
6487,III,Hoops of gold
6488,III,"Circle necks, wrists, fingers,"
6489,III,"Pierce ears,"
6490,III,Poise on heads
6491,III,And fly up above them in coloured sparkles.
6492,III,Gold!
6493,III,Gold!
6494,III,The opera house is a treasure-box of gold.
6495,III,Gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit:
6496,III,"Gold of horns, trumpets, tubas;"
6497,III,"Gold--spun-gold, twittering-gold, snapping-gold"
6498,III,Of harps.
6499,III,"The conductor raises his baton,"

6509,III,"One note,"
6510,III,"A drop:  transparent, iridescent,"
6511,III,"A gold bubble,"
6512,III,It floats... floats...

6514,III,In the grand tier.

6531,IV,Struck to white
6532,IV,"An instant,"
6533,IV,Stream in two flat lines
6534,IV,Slipping past each other with the smoothness of oil.
6535,IV,Like a four-sided wedge
6536,IV,The Custom House Tower
6537,IV,"Pokes at the low, flat sky,"
6538,IV,"Pushing it farther and farther up,"
6539,IV,"Lifting it away from the house-tops,"
6540,IV,"Lifting it in one piece as though it were a sheet of tin,"
6541,IV,With the lever of its apex.
6542,IV,"The cross-hatchings of rain cut the Tower obliquely,"
6543,IV,"Scratching lines of black wire across it,"
6544,IV,Mutilating its perpendicular grey surface
6545,IV,With the sharp precision of tools.
6546,IV,"The city is rigid with straight lines and angles,"
6547,IV,A chequered table of blacks and greys.
6548,IV,Oblong blocks of flatness
6549,IV,"Crawl by with low-geared engines,"
6550,IV,And pass to short upright squares
6551,IV,Shrinking with distance.
6552,IV,"A steamer in the basin blows its whistle,"
6553,IV,"And the sound shoots across the rain hatchings,"
6554,IV,"A narrow, level bar of steel."
6555,IV,Hard cubes of lemon
6556,IV,Superimpose themselves upon the fronts of buildings
6557,IV,As the windows light up.
6558,IV,But the lemon cubes are edged with angles

6564,IV,Without curves.
6565,IV,"A horse steps in a puddle,"
6566,IV,"And white, glaring water spurts up"
6567,IV,"In stiff, outflaring lines,"
6568,IV,Like the rattling stems of reeds.
6569,IV,"The city is heraldic with angles,"
6570,IV,A sombre escutcheon of argent and sable
6571,IV,And countercoloured bends of rain
6572,IV,Hung over a four-square civilization.
6573,IV,"When a street lamp comes out,"

6575,IV,"To rest my brain with the suffusing, round brilliance of its globe."
