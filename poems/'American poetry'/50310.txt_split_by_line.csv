134,JILTED JACK,A noble and a generous mind
135,JILTED JACK,Was Jack's;
136,JILTED JACK,Folks knew he would not talk behind
137,JILTED JACK,Their backs:
138,JILTED JACK,"But when some maiden fresh and young,"
139,JILTED JACK,"At Jack a bit of banter flung,"
140,JILTED JACK,She soon discovered that his tongue
141,JILTED JACK,Was sharp as any ax.
142,JILTED JACK,
143,JILTED JACK,A flirt of most engaging wiles
144,JILTED JACK,Was Jill;
145,JILTED JACK,"On Jack she lavished all her smiles,"
146,JILTED JACK,Until
147,JILTED JACK,Her slave (and he was not the first)
148,JILTED JACK,"Of lovesick swains became the worst,"
149,JILTED JACK,"His glance a strong box might have burst,"
150,JILTED JACK,His sighs were fit to kill.
151,JILTED JACK,
152,JILTED JACK,"One April morning, clear and fair,"
153,JILTED JACK,When both
154,JILTED JACK,Of staying home and idling there
155,JILTED JACK,In sloth
156,JILTED JACK,"Were weary, Jack remarked to Jill:"
157,JILTED JACK,"""Oh, what's the sense in sitting still?"
158,JILTED JACK,"Let's mount the slope of yonder hill."""
159,JILTED JACK,And she was nothing loth.
160,JILTED JACK,
161,JILTED JACK,"But as she answered: ""What's the use?"""
162,JILTED JACK,The gruff
163,JILTED JACK,"Young swain replied: ""Oh, there's excuse"
164,JILTED JACK,Enough.
165,JILTED JACK,Your doting parents water lack;
166,JILTED JACK,"We'll fill a pail and bring it back."""
167,JILTED JACK,(The reader will perceive that Jack
168,JILTED JACK,Was putting up a bluff.)
169,JILTED JACK,
170,JILTED JACK,Thus hand in hand the tempting hill
171,JILTED JACK,"They scaled,"
172,JILTED JACK,"And Jack proposed a kiss to Jill,"
173,JILTED JACK,And failed!
174,JILTED JACK,"One backward start, one step too bold,"
175,JILTED JACK,"And down the hill the couple rolled,"
176,JILTED JACK,"Resembling, if the truth were told,"
177,JILTED JACK,A luggage train derailed.
178,JILTED JACK,
179,JILTED JACK,"With eyes ablaze with anger, she"
180,JILTED JACK,Exclaimed:
181,JILTED JACK,"""Well, who'd have thought! You'd ought to be"
182,JILTED JACK,Ashamed!
183,JILTED JACK,"You quite forget yourself, it's plain,"
184,JILTED JACK,"So I'll forget you, too. Insane"
185,JILTED JACK,"Young man, I'll say _oafweederzane_."""
186,JILTED JACK,(Her German might be blamed.)
187,JILTED JACK,
188,JILTED JACK,"But Jack, whose linguist's pride was pricked,"
189,JILTED JACK,"To shine,"
190,JILTED JACK,"Asked: ""_Meine KÃ¶nigin will nicht_"
191,JILTED JACK,"Be mine?"""
192,JILTED JACK,"And when she answered: ""Nein"" in spleen,"
193,JILTED JACK,"He cried: ""Then in the soup tureen"
194,JILTED JACK,You'll stay. You're not the only queen
195,JILTED JACK,"Discarded for a nein!"""
196,JILTED JACK,
197,JILTED JACK,THE MORAL'S made for maidens young
198,JILTED JACK,And small:
199,JILTED JACK,If you would in a foreign tongue
200,JILTED JACK,"Enthrall,"
201,JILTED JACK,Lead off undaunted in a Swede
202,JILTED JACK,"Or Spanish speech, and you'll succeed,"
203,JILTED JACK,But they who in a German lead
204,JILTED JACK,No favor win at all.

219,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Crosser than Little Bow Peep:
220,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Quite apathetic, impassible"
221,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"People described her as: ""That"

225,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Yet, as she dozed in a grotto-like"

228,LITTLE BOW PEEP,What with her sheep and her crook;

230,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Casual passer would think.
231,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Poets pronounced her a symphony,"
232,LITTLE BOW PEEP,All in the palest of pink.
233,LITTLE BOW PEEP,
234,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Thus it was not enigmatical,"
235,LITTLE BOW PEEP,That the young shepherd who first
236,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Found her asleep, in ecstatical"
237,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Sighs of felicity burst:
238,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Such was his sudden beatitude
239,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"That, as he gazed at her so,"
240,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Daphnis gave vent to this platitude:
241,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"""My! Ain't she elegant though!"""
242,LITTLE BOW PEEP,
243,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Roused from some dream of Arcadia,"
244,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Little Bow Peep with a start
245,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Answered him: ""I ain't afraid o' yer!"
246,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"P'raps you imagine you're smart!"""
247,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"Daphnis protested impulsively,"
248,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Blushing as red as a rose;
249,LITTLE BOW PEEP,All was in vain. She convulsively
250,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Punched the young man in the nose!
251,LITTLE BOW PEEP,
252,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"All of it's true, every word of it!"
253,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"I was not present to peep,"
254,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"But if you ask how I heard of it,"
255,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Please to remember the sheep.
256,LITTLE BOW PEEP,There is no need of excuse. You will
257,LITTLE BOW PEEP,See how such scandals occur:
258,LITTLE BOW PEEP,"If you recall Mother Goose, you will"
259,LITTLE BOW PEEP,Know what tail-bearers they were!
260,LITTLE BOW PEEP,

281,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,She was one of those creatures
282,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Whose features
283,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Are hard beyond any reclaim;
284,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,And she loved in a hovel
285,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"To grovel,"
286,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,And she hadn't a cent to her name.
287,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,She owned neither gallants
288,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Nor talents;
289,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"She borrowed extensively, too,"
290,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,From all of her dozens
291,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Of cousins,"
292,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,And never refunded a _sou_:
293,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Yet all they said in abuse of her
294,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Was: ""She is prouder than Lucifer!"""
295,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"(That, I must say, without meaning to blame,"
296,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Is always the way with that kind of a dame!)
297,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,
298,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,There never was jolli-
299,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Er colley
300,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Than Old Mother Hubbard had found,"
301,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Though cheaply she bought him,"
302,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,She'd taught him
303,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,To follow her meekly around:
304,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,But though she would lick him
305,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"And kick him,"
306,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,It never had any effect;
307,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,He always was howling
308,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"And growling,"
309,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,But goodness! What could you expect?
310,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Colleys were never to flourish meant
311,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"'Less they had plenty of nourishment,"
312,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,All that he had were the feathers she'd pluck
313,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Off an occasional chicken or duck.
314,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,
315,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,The colley was barred in
316,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"The garden,"
317,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,He howled and he wailed and he whined.
318,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"The neighbors indignant,"
319,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Malignant
320,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Petitions unanimous signed.
321,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"""The nuisance grows nightly,"""
322,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Politely
323,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"They wrote. ""It's an odious hound,"
324,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"And either you'll fill him,"
325,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Or kill him,"
326,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Or else he must go to the pound.
327,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,For if this howling infernally
328,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Is to continue nocturnally--
329,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Pardon us, ma'am, if we seem to be curt--"
330,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"Somebody's apt to get horribly hurt!"""
331,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,
332,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Mother Hubbard cried loudly
333,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,And proudly:
334,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"""Lands sakes! but you give yourselves airs!"
335,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,I'll take the law to you
336,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"And sue you."""
337,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,"The neighbors responded: ""Who cares?"
338,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,We none of us care if
339,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,The sheriff
340,OLD MOTHER HUBBARD,Lock every man jack of us up;

379,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"She labored hard and zealously, but always guarded jealously"
380,LITTLE JACK HORNER,The secrets of the dishes she invented every day.
381,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"She'd take some indigestible, unpopular comestible,"
382,LITTLE JACK HORNER,And to its better nature would so tenderly appeal
383,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"That Jack invoked a benison upon a haunch of venison,"
384,LITTLE JACK HORNER,When really she was serving him a little leg of veal!
385,LITTLE JACK HORNER,
386,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Jack said she was a miracle. The word was not satirical,"
387,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"For daily climbing upward, she excelled herself at last:"
388,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"The acme of facility, the zenith of ability"
389,LITTLE JACK HORNER,Was what she gave her brother for his Christmas Day repast.
390,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"He dined that evening eagerly and anything but meagerly,"
391,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"And when he'd had his salad and his quart of Extra Dry,"
392,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"With sisterly benignity, and just a touch of dignity,"
393,LITTLE JACK HORNER,She placed upon the table an unutterable pie!
394,LITTLE JACK HORNER,
395,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Unflagging pertinacity, and technical sagacity,"
396,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Long nights of sleepless vigil, and long days of constant care"
397,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Had been involved in making it, improving it, and baking it,"
398,LITTLE JACK HORNER,Until of other pies it was the wonder and despair:
399,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"So princely and so prominent, so solemn, so predominant"
400,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"It looked upon the table, that, with fascinated eye,"
401,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"The youth, with sudden wonder struck, electrified, and thunder struck,"
402,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Could only stammer stupidly: ""Oh Golly! What a pie!"""
403,LITTLE JACK HORNER,
404,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"In view of his satiety, it almost seemed impiety"
405,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"To carve this crowning triumph of a culinary life,"
406,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"But, braced by his avidity, with sudden intrepidity"
407,LITTLE JACK HORNER,He broke its dome imposing with a common kitchen knife.
408,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Ah, hideous fatality! for when with eager palate he"
409,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Commenced to eat, he happened on an accident uncouth,"
410,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"And cried with stifled moan: ""Of it one plum I tried. The stone of it"
411,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Had never been extracted, and I've broke a wisdom tooth!"""
412,LITTLE JACK HORNER,
413,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Jack's sister wept effusively, but loudly and abusively"
414,LITTLE JACK HORNER,His unreserved opinion of her talents he proclaimed;
415,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"He called her names like ""driveller"" and ""simpleton"" and ""sniveller,"""
416,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"And others, which to mention I am really too ashamed."
417,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"THE MORAL: It is saddening, embarrassing, and maddening"
418,LITTLE JACK HORNER,A stone to strike in what you thought was paste. One thing alone
419,LITTLE JACK HORNER,"Than this mischance is crueller, and that is for a jeweller"
420,LITTLE JACK HORNER,To strike but paste in what he fondly thought to be a stone.

434,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"And, as 'twas a June day, and just about noonday,"
435,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,She wanted to eat--like the best of us:
436,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Her diet was whey, and I hasten to say"
437,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,It is wholesome and people grow fat on it.
438,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"The spot being lonely, the lady not only"
439,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Discovered the tuffet, but sat on it."
440,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,
441,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"A rivulet gabbled beside her and babbled,"
442,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"As rivulets always are thought to do,"

449,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,
450,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Albeit unsightly, this creature politely"
451,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Said: ""Madam, I earnestly vow to you,"
452,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,I'm penitent that I did not bring my hat. I
453,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Should otherwise certainly bow to you."""
454,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Though anxious to please, he was so ill at ease"
455,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"That he lost all his sense of propriety,"
456,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,And grew so inept that he clumsily stept
457,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,In her plate--which is barred in Society.
458,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,
459,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,This curious error completed her terror;
460,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"She shuddered, and growing much paler, not"
461,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Only left tuffet, but dealt him a buffet"
462,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,Which doubled him up in a sailor-knot.
463,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,It should be explained that at this he was pained:
464,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"He cried: ""I have vexed you, no doubt of it!"
465,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Your fist's like a truncheon."" ""You're still in my luncheon,"""
466,LITTLE MISS MUFFET,"Was all that she answered. ""Get out of it!"""

1231,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Including twins in kilts:
1232,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"All day Jack carted lumber,"
1233,THE SPRAT FAMILY,All day his wife made quilts.
1234,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Thus heartlessly neglected
1235,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Twelve hours in twenty-four,"
1236,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"As might have been expected,"
1237,THE SPRAT FAMILY,The twins sat on the floor:
1238,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"And all the buttons, I should state,"
1239,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"They chanced to find, they promptly ate."
1240,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"This was not meat, but still it's true"
1241,THE SPRAT FAMILY,We did the same when we were two.

1243,THE SPRAT FAMILY,The wife (whose name was Julia)
1244,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Maintained an ample board,"

1246,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Lean meat she quite abhorred.
1247,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Here also should be stated
1248,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Another fact: 'tis that
1249,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Her spouse abominated
1250,THE SPRAT FAMILY,The very taste of fat.
1251,THE SPRAT FAMILY,This contrast curious of taste
1252,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Precluded any thought of waste,"
1253,THE SPRAT FAMILY,For all they left of any meal
1254,THE SPRAT FAMILY,No self-respecting dog would steal.
1255,THE SPRAT FAMILY,
1256,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"No generous _table d'hÃ´te_ meal,"
1257,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"No dainties packed in tins,"
1258,THE SPRAT FAMILY,But only bowls of oatmeal
1259,THE SPRAT FAMILY,They gave the wretched twins;
1260,THE SPRAT FAMILY,And yet like princes pampered
1261,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Had lived those babes accursed,"
1262,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Could they have fed unhampered:--
1263,THE SPRAT FAMILY,I have not told the worst!
1264,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Since nothing from the dining-room
1265,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Was left to feed the cook and groom,"
1266,THE SPRAT FAMILY,It seems that these domestics cruel
1267,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Were led to steal the children's gruel!
1268,THE SPRAT FAMILY,
1269,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"The twins, all hopes resigning,"
1270,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"And wounded to the core,"
1271,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Confined themselves to dining
1272,THE SPRAT FAMILY,On buttons off the floor.
1273,THE SPRAT FAMILY,No passionate resentment
1274,THE SPRAT FAMILY,The docile babes displayed:
1275,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Each day in calm contentment
1276,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Three hearty meals they made.
1277,THE SPRAT FAMILY,And daily Jack and Mrs. Sprat
1278,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"Ate all the lean and all the fat,"
1279,THE SPRAT FAMILY,And every day the groom and cook
1280,THE SPRAT FAMILY,The children's meal contrived to hook.
1281,THE SPRAT FAMILY,
1282,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"But when the twins grew older,"
1283,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"As twins are apt to do,"
1284,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"And, shoulder touching shoulder,"
1285,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Sat Sundays in their pew.
1286,THE SPRAT FAMILY,They saw no Christian glory
1287,THE SPRAT FAMILY,"In parting with a dime,"
1288,THE SPRAT FAMILY,And in the offertory
1289,THE SPRAT FAMILY,Dropped buttons every time.
