65,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
66,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
67,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
68,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,SCENE.--_A ravine amid the slopes of Mount Carmel. On one side a
69,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"hermitage, on the other a rustic cross. The sun is about to set in the"
70,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"sea, which fills the background_."
71,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
72,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
73,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
74,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. Thou who wast tempted in the wilderness,"
75,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Guard me this night, for there are snares in sleep"
76,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"That baffle watching. O poisoned, bitter life"
77,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of doubt and longing! Were death possible,"
78,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Who would not choose it? But that dim estate
79,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Might plunge my witless ghost in grosser matter
80,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And in still closer meshes choke my life.
81,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yet thus to live is grievous agony,"
82,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"When sleep and thirst, hunger and weariness,"
83,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And the sharp goads of thought-awakened lust
84,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Torture the flesh, and inward doubt of all"
85,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Embitters with its lurking mockery
86,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Virtue's sad victories. This wilderness
87,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Whither I fly from the approach of men
88,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Keeps not the devil out. The treacherous glens
89,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Are full of imps, and ghosts in moonlit vesture"
90,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Startle the watches of the lidless night.
91,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The giant forest, in my youth so fair,"
92,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Is now a den of demons; the hoarse sea
93,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Is foul with monsters hungry for my soul;
94,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The dark and pregnant soil, once innocent"
95,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Mother of flowers, reeks with venomous worms,"
96,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And sore temptation is in all the world.
97,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"But hist! A sound, as if of clanking hoofs."
98,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Saint Anthony protect me from the fiend,"
99,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Whether he come in guise of horned beast
100,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or of pernicious man! If I must die
101,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Be it upon this hallowed ground, O Lord!"
102,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
103,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
104,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Hides in the hut._
105,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
106,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,_Enter a young_ KNIGHT.
107,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
108,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
109,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT [_reining in his horse_].
110,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
111,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Rest, Albus, rest.--Doth the sun sink in glory"
112,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Because he sinks to rise?--
113,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Breathe here a space; here bends the promontory,"
114,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,There Acra's haven lies.
115,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Those specks are galleys waiting for the gale
116,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To make for Christian shores.
117,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To-morrow they will fly with bellying sail
118,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And plash of swinging oars,"
119,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Bearing us both to where the freeman tills
120,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The plot where he was born,"
121,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And belfry answers belfry from the hills
122,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Above the fields of corn.
123,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thence one less sea to traverse ere we come
124,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Where all our hopes abide,"
125,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"One truant journey less to end in home,"
126,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thy mistress, and my bride. [_He dismounts._"
127,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Good Albus, 't is enough for one day's riding."
128,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Here shall our bivouac be.
129,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Surely by that green sward some brook is hiding
130,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To welcome thee and me.
131,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yes, hark! Its laugh betrays it. Graze thou there,"
132,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Nor fear the camp's alarms.
133,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
134,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
135,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"[_Lets the horse go and turns_, _perceiving the cross"
136,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,on the hillside._
137,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
138,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
139,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"See where a cross, inviting me to prayer,"
140,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Outspreads its sacred arms.
141,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,O first of many that mine eyes shall see
142,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"On altar, tomb, and tower,"
143,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Art thou the last of crosses come to me
144,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Before my guerdon's hour?
145,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or first or last, and by whatever hands"
146,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Here planted in the wild,"
147,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Hail to thee, cross, that blessest in far lands"
148,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thy champion and thy child.
149,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
150,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
151,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Goes up to the cross and kneels before it. The
152,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,angel of the Lord appeared to Mary And she conceived
153,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,of the Holy Ghost._
154,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
155,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Continues silently._
156,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
157,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
158,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT [_from within]._
159,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
160,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,All's quiet. God hath made the danger pass.
161,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
162,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
163,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Comes out._
164,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
165,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
166,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Nay, hold! A horse without a rider here?"
167,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Perchance a devil, come, if I should mount him,"
168,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To gallop with me into yawning hell.
169,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yet he looks gentle, munching the young grass,"
170,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The tempting bridle looped about his neck.
171,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I will go catch him. When the traders pass--
172,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And they pass after Christmas--I will barter
173,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The beast for a good cloak. The winter's blasts
174,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Are on us.
175,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
176,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. _Behold the handmaid of the Lord._
177,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,_Be't done to me according to thy word_--
178,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
179,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
180,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Confutes silently_.
181,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
182,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
183,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. A voice! A Christian voice! Some winged angel
184,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Floats through the ether, magnifying God."
185,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Merciful heaven! There, ay, there he kneels"
186,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Before the cross I planted. 'T is the cross
187,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"That to earth brings down heaven. Yes, Saint Michael,"
188,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For he is clad in arms, and his casque fringed"
189,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With the bright nimbus of his golden hair.
190,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Yet he seems wingless; if he stirs a limb
191,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The heavy armour clangs. No angel, surely;"
192,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Rather Saint George, with steed and magic lance"
193,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Returned to fight against the infidel.
194,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
195,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. _And the Word was made flesh and dwelt
196,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,among us.                   [Continues silently._
197,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
198,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. Listen! they speak my native tongue in heaven.
199,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Those are the words my sainted mother spake--
200,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Nightly she crooned them, teaching Palmerin"
201,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,His orisons.
202,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
203,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
204,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_The_ KNIGHT _rises._
205,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
206,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
207,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Come, shall I challenge him?"
208,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,No: I am foul. I will hide crouching here
209,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And spy him as he goes.
210,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
211,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. What stirreth there?
212,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
213,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
214,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Pushes a branch aside._
215,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
216,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
217,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT [_falling on his knees]._
218,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Have mercy, glorious Saint! a sinful man"
219,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Lives in this hovel; no man's enemy
220,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Except his own. Sir, spare an anchorite."
221,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
222,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Fear nothing, holy man. I am a Christian"
223,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Although no saint, but sinful more than thou"
224,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Who in the desert livest near to God.
225,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My sword is stained with blood, my heart is rash,"
226,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And if my youth is free from foul dishonour
227,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T is God's good mercies hedge my wayward days
228,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And marvellously guide me through the world.
229,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But thou art surely wise. In solitude
230,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The mind of the Most High possesseth men,"
231,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And they whom sorrow chaseth from the world
232,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Learn in their grief the purposes of heaven.
233,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"God's hand appears in this, that here I find thee"
234,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To shrive me, father. Many months I roam"
235,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Through heathen wilds in sorry need of shrift.
236,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Who knows if in some luckless fray to-morrow
237,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I bite the dust, or in that golden sea"
238,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Perish unknelled and far from Christendom?
239,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,A soldier's soul should be like his bright blade
240,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Ready to unsheathe.
241,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
242,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.              O music of high thoughts!
243,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,O harmony of long-forgotten words!
244,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Fair visitation! In her youth the soul,"
245,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Gathering, the heavy heritage of Adam,"
246,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Looks with strange horror on her own abyss
247,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And on the stars, and her increasing knowledge"
248,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Ever increaseth sorrow; yet with years,"
249,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Touching the depths and wholly mortified,"
250,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,She sees her desert bloom with mystic flowers
251,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And sweeter smiles of God. O mortal bosom
252,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Both in foreboding and in hope beguiled!
253,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Not where I fancied in my night of trouble
254,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Dawns comfort on mine eyes, but wondrously."
255,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Whence earnest thou? Tell me what princely house
256,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And fruitful country bred and nurtured thee.
257,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
258,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. 'T is not a fruitful land. On heathered hills
259,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,My father fed his flocks. We gazed not down
260,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,On vineyard slopes and waters blue as these
261,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But there a sea of swaying tree-tops spread
262,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Boundless beneath us, without path or tower,"
263,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Save where beside the river's bend the monks
264,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Had built their cells and cleared the wood away.
265,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,We called it milking time when we could hear
266,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The distant music of their matin chimes.
267,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
268,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. Be your monks rich?
269,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
270,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.      Their fields are ploughed and brown
271,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But the poor upland shepherd has no corn;
272,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"His flock must feed him with its milk and flesh,"
273,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Unless he snare a partridge in the wood
274,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"As I did oft, or standing in the brook"
275,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Where the green water eddies in the pool
276,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Enmesh the foolish fishes.
277,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
278,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                     Never shepherd
279,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Could bear these arms or show this courtesy.
280,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Where wast thou bred, if thou wast born a hind,"
281,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That thou art gentle? Who hath knighted thee?
282,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
283,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. The Baron of the Marches is my liege;
284,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To him I owe my nurture and my sword,"
285,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And the sweet hope that leads me.
286,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
287,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT.                       Ah, the faith?"
288,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
289,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Nay, that my mother gave me with her prayers,"
290,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Saintliest of women.
291,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
292,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.             Thy mother and my own
293,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Were then alike. Hast thou another hope
294,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Sweeter than faith to thank thy master for?
295,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
296,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. He hath a daughter for whose hand I serve,"
297,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Having her love; and on the happy night
298,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,When I kept vigil o'er the virgin arms
299,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In which I should be knighted at the dawn
300,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He promised me her hand, if I proved worthy"
301,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In five years' service. At the morrow's mass
302,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"When we had both partaken of the Lord,"
303,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I knelt before him, and while all his vassals"
304,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Stood in a ring about us, up he rose"
305,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And with his flat sword struck my shoulder thus,"
306,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Speaking these words, now graven on my heart:"
307,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""Arise, Sir Knight, to battle with the world"
308,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For God and honour. If in youth thou fall,"
309,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"May thy bright soul take instant wing to heaven,"
310,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But if thou blazon on this argent shield
311,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Valorous deeds, and come in safety back,"
312,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thy worth shall stand in lieu of ancient blood,"
313,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For valour was the first nobility,"
314,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And with the blessing of a hapless man
315,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Whom three brave sons, reversing nature's sentence,"
316,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Condemned to mourn them, I will then deliver"
317,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My daughter to thy hands. She and her honour,"
318,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My lands, my castle, and my name be thine."""
319,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Love is the hope, sweeter than faith in heaven,"
320,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For which I toil in arms.
321,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Enough of that.
322,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Methinks thou art a priest, and ere I leave thee"
323,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I fain would make confession of what sins
324,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Lie on my soul.
325,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
326,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT.         God knoweth what they are,"
327,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And hath, methinks, forgiven them already,"
328,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For by the candour of thy looks I know
329,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thou livest in his grace. But tell them o'er,"
330,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For by the speaking of a word the heart
331,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Is lightened of its burden: and the Lord
332,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Commissioned us to listen in his name
333,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To all men's woes, and counsel and forgive."
334,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Therefore say on.
335,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
336,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.          Alas, where all is frail"
337,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I know not with what sorrow to begin.
338,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If I could keep the thought of God alive
339,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I might live better; but my wit is loose
340,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And wanders into silly dreams awake,"
341,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,All to no purpose. Everything that stirs
342,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Sets me athinking of its life and ways
343,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And I forget my own. If a frog jump,"
344,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or busy squirrel run across my path,"
345,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or three sad crows fly cawing through the wood,"
346,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or if I spy a fox's trail, or print"
347,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Of deer's foot in the mould--off go my thoughts
348,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And I am many leagues in fairy land
349,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Before I shake away the lethargy
350,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And say to my weak soul, Thou art a knight,"
351,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,What hast thou done to-day?
352,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
353,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. Be these thy sins?
354,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
355,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Nay, not the chief. For in all exercise,"
356,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or when in any test or feat of arms
357,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I meet another, not the worthy cause,"
358,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The thought of God, my liege, or beauteous mistress"
359,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Strengthens my arm, but the mere rage and pride"
360,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of the encounter sweeps my soul along,"
361,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And win I must, whatever goal it be,"
362,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,When I am once engaged. That's in the blood.
363,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,So were our heathen fathers wont to fight
364,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Merciless battles. But glory is the Lord's
365,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Who metes with measure. Still I stumble there.
366,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And envy, too, I often sin in that,"
367,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For from my childhood up I never brooked
368,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A swifter runner, or a quicker eye"
369,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To hit the mark, and what another does"
370,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Better than I, that still I strive to do"
371,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Till he be worsted. Else I cannot sleep.
372,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
373,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. Thou knowest, child, that victory is God's"
374,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To give and to deny. He gives it thee:
375,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"'T is proof of thy deserving. Use it well,"
376,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Which if thou do, to crave the victory"
377,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"In thee, a soldier, is no grievous sin."
378,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"But hast thou not more special sins than these,"
379,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"No wrong, no murder?"
380,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
381,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.                 Murder have I none,"
382,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If murder be to kill a man by stealth
383,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or in a private quarrel, but in war"
384,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I oft have slain my man. I wear a sword
385,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Though nature gave me not a butcher's hand
386,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"That loves to use it.--Oh, 't is marvellous"
387,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"How men will slaughter for the sake of blood,"
388,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And Christians too. Before I crossed the sea,"
389,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The Margrave fought a battle in the north
390,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Against the heathen. I then followed him,"
391,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And when the fight was over and the foe,"
392,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Routed, had fled into a deep morass"
393,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Black 'neath the splendours of a fiery sky,"
394,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The bugle called us back: and back I rode,"
395,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My shield slung on my back, my visor up,"
396,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Saying the Angelus, such peace there was"
397,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Beneath the twilight heavens, when a groan"
398,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That seemed the ending of a soul in pain
399,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Made me look down; there lay a heathen knight,"
400,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And on his wounded breast a Christian crouched,"
401,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Stabbing him still; I snatched the villain's sword,"
402,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"But just in time, and seized him by the throat"
403,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Amazed, and loud with oaths; ""Thou slave,"" quoth I,"
404,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""Why wilt thou send a valiant soul to hell,"
405,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That might be saved for heaven? The man is mine.
406,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Take thou his armour, if some happy chance"
407,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Have made thee victor. But outrage not the cause
408,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Which thou wouldst well defend."" We stripped the man,"
409,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Whose gaping wounds were deep and hard to staunch
410,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With the few strips remaining of my tunic
411,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Torn in the fight; and as he could not sit,"
412,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,We needs must lift and bear him in our arms
413,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Back to the camp. He was a knight indeed,"
414,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And when, his fever passing, I explained"
415,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Our holy faith--(our chaplains spoke not well
416,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,His northern tongue)--he listened open-eyed
417,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"As a child might, and when I stopped and asked,"
418,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""Dost thou believe?"" he gazed and said: ""I do."
419,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"As thou believest, so in life and death"
420,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Will I believe.""--So humble was his soul"
421,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And open to the sudden grace of heaven.
422,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Yet him my Christian ruffian would have slain
423,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To see the red blood ooze. 'T is pitiful!
424,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And yet I do him wrong. The fellow came
425,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The morning after, shy, with heavy looks,"
426,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And said he begged to bring the armour back.
427,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"It was not his, he had not felled the knight"
428,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But found him on the ground; and when I bade him
429,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Retain the proffered sword, to use it better,"
430,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He sobbed aloud, and bathed my hands in tears,"
431,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,So hearty was his grief.--But I confess
432,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Another's sins, good father, and forget"
433,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My own, which I should tell of."
434,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
435,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                          Trouble not
436,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To tell them over, for I know them now."
437,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They are the same which seen in other men
438,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The world calls virtues. But one vice there is
439,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Which noblest natures in their youth are prone to.
440,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Hast thou offended against chastity?
441,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
442,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Ah, father, I am guilty too in that,"
443,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If whosoever looketh on a woman
444,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Unholily, already hath committed"
445,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Adultery in his heart. 'T is in my thoughts,"
446,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Perhaps, that I have sinned; but I am young,"
447,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And have from childhood loved one noble maid.
448,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,All other faces are but mirrors to me
449,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Of what she is in truth. When others smile
450,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And seem to say that haply they could love me,"
451,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My heart yearns to them, yet its yearning goes"
452,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Like incense past a picture, to her spirit."
453,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They are memorials of her I review
454,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To make me constant. Nay, but that's not all."
455,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A heavy season comes,--I know not whether"
456,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"At waxing or at waning of the moon,--"
457,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,When but the babble of a girlish voice
458,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Heard from a window, or a hand stretched forth,"
459,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Or a chance motion, stops the beating heart"
460,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Here in my breast, and melts my very soul,"
461,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And I stand there bewitched, my brain benumbed,"
462,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And nothing in me but the fell desire
463,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To do I know not what.--'T is dreams, dreams, dreams,"
464,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And they are evil, treacherous, and base"
465,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,When they come so. One day on every side
466,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"They girt me round. I cried to them ""For shame!"""
467,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They would not go nor quit tormenting me
468,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Till I put spurs into my steed, and rode,"
469,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Rode with clenched teeth, hacking all branches off"
470,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Within my axe's compass. When I stopped
471,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My soul was free: ""We have outridden them,"
472,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Albus,"" I cried, ""the demons of that place"
473,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Of foul enchantment! Here's the blue again
474,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Smiling upon us, God, and all his saints."""
475,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Father, methinks the agony of death"
476,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,May happen so. A stifling darkness comes
477,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Upon the feeble soul, and doubtfully"
478,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,She keeps her strength alive on far-off hopes
479,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In that great stress of anguish. But it passes
480,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And slowly we awake in paradise.
481,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
482,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. In paradise, my son, when thou awakest"
483,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If I still suffer in the lake of fire
484,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Make me some prayerful alms, who in the name"
485,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"
486,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Absolve thee now.
487,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
488,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.             And for my penance, father,"
489,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,What lay you on?
490,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
491,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.             Three _Aves_ for three days
492,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Say for the soul of one unlike thyself
493,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Though of thy country. Robbers bore him thence
494,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Into their kingdoms. Hast thou never heard
495,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Tell of the hordes that ravaged Christendom
496,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Ere thou wast born, belike."
497,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
498,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.                     Nay, I remember."
499,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T was then my mother brought me from the hills
500,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To dwell beside the castle, for the Huns"
501,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Had slain my father and my elder brother
502,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And driven the sheep away.
503,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
504,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                     The Huns? The Huns?
505,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
506,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Ay, when they ravaged all the land about"
507,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Upon their western march.
508,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
509,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                     They slew thy brother?
510,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thou sawest his body?
511,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
512,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.                  Nay, we saw it not."
513,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"We fled, and many fearful weeks were past"
514,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Ere we returned to search.
515,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
516,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                     The Lord is great.
517,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thy brother's name was--
518,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
519,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.                     Damian.
520,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
521,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT.                            God of mercies,"
522,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,What shall become of us!
523,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
524,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.                  Thy gaze is fixed.
525,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,What ails thee? Rest thee there.
526,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
527,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                          I cannot speak.
528,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I faint. Since dawn I have not tasted food.
529,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A draught! A morsel! Ah, my end is near."
530,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
531,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. I have a panier by my saddle-bow
532,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With food.--Albus has wandered down the glade.--
533,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I shall be here anon.                 [_Exit._
534,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
535,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                What bodes this portent?
536,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My practised soul well knows the things of earth,"
537,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And there is none like this. Impossible.
538,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"This is some essence metaphysical,"
539,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And not the thing it seems. So much is sure;
540,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But whether fiend or minister of grace
541,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,How shall I know? Is he a subtle demon
542,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And wins my ear? I am the devil's pawn.
543,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Is he an angel and I put him by?
544,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Then I am damned for that. All other sins
545,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Shall be forgiven, save such blasphemy"
546,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Against the Holy Ghost. And being dead
547,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Might not my brother's spirit come from heaven?
548,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And though I be unworthy in my sins
549,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of saintly visitation, I believe"
550,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,This vision is from God. 'T is beautiful
551,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And clothed in Christian speech and charity.
552,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Was not Mount Carmel, Lord, thy haunt of old"
553,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Where men went up to meet thee? Show thy face.
554,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The Apostles at Emmaus knew the Lord
555,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"When he broke bread. Blind heart, an angel comes"
556,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To sup with thee to-night. Misknow him not.
557,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The ravens of Elijah, who were black,"
558,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Came from the Lord, and Raphael himself"
559,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Who led the lost Tobias by the hand
560,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Was black beside this vision's loveliness.
561,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yea, by its glory pale the three bright strangers"
562,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That from the desert came to Abraham's tent
563,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In figure of the blessed Trinity.--
564,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"What am I raving? Am I Abraham,"
565,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Tobias, or Elijah, that the gods"
566,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Should visit me? Did not the artful devil
567,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Come to Saint Anthony in beauteous form?
568,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"When first this ghost approached I dreaded him,--"
569,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A certain sign. Yet by his subtle wiles,"
570,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Flattering my earthly hopes, he vanquished me"
571,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And quieted my doubts--as if Beelzebub
572,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Could not feign piety to murder souls!
573,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"What, my young brother, whom I counted dead,"
574,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Found in this shape, a knight, a Paladin,"
575,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,A vision such as minstrels sing about?
576,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Palpable lie, abominable snare"
577,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The demon mocks me with! Let me but cry,"
578,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""I am thy brother, I am Damian,"""
579,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Let me but clasp his knees and with a flood
580,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Of joyful penitential childish tears
581,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Water his feet, and then look up again"
582,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To drink the grace of his benignant eyes
583,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And by his kiss be healed in soul and body,"
584,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And I shall see the grinning demon's self
585,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And feel that icy manacle, his claw,"
586,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Clasping my wrist for ever. ""Thou art damned,"
587,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Damned,"" shrieks the fiend, ""damned in believing lies,"
588,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Damned in renouncing for a dreamful joy
589,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thy solitude and penance. Thou art damned."""
590,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yes, 't is a hellish plot confronts me here."
591,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A knight, my brother, come to comfort me!"
592,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T is madness and wild dreams.--Again he comes.
593,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"His gesture says, Here's food. Pitiful heaven,"
594,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Assist me now. Let me not now be lost.
595,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Suffer my vigils and perpetual fasts
596,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To strengthen my resolve. To be so happy
597,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Were rash, and ah, how vain! To drown their sorrow"
598,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Fools barter heaven for a drunkard's joy.
599,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
600,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
601,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,[_Re-enter_ KNIGHT.
602,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
603,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
604,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. Drink this. 'T is water from the virgin springs
605,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of Carmel, pure and cold. Stains of the world"
606,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That leave the heavens clean leave earth's own heart
607,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Immaculate. 'T is but her outer garment
608,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That man and roving beast avail to smear.
609,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The curse of Adam stops at living things
610,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And Nature sleeps untainted. There is healing
611,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In such a fountain draught. Taste of this bread.
612,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Acorns I also bring and well-dried figs.
613,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Take freely: there is plenteous store for both.
614,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For often as I ride a village through
615,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or tighten as I start from hostelries
616,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My horse's girth, the hospitable dame"
617,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or her young daughter brings me something forth
618,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"From the rich larder, now a loaf or fowl"
619,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And now a goat-skin full of seasoned wine.
620,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,God prompts their kindly hearts and makes them bounteous
621,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Lest my strength fail me ere my journey's end,"
622,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Who knows how distant yet.--Come, break thy fast."
623,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Remember, father, this is Christmas Eve"
624,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"When angels, joining in the songs of earth,"
625,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Make mortals joyful, knowing their painful flesh"
626,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Allied to deity.
627,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
628,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.            I crave no food.
629,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
630,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. Nay, nay, thy faintness called for it but now."
631,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
632,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. Not hunger gave that cry but wonderment.
633,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
634,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. At my poor brother's name?
635,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
636,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                          Thy brother lives.
637,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
638,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. Where? Dost thou know him? In this Holy Land?
639,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
640,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. Poor Damian of the Marches! Verily
641,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"His sins are scarlet. Pray for him, fair Knight,"
642,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But seek not to discover his abode.
643,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If thou should st find him he would die of shame
644,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For bringing shame upon thee.
645,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
646,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.                          Hast thou seen him
647,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or is it slander of a gossip's mouth
648,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That now usurps thy tongue? If he be fallen
649,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,He hath the greater need of charity
650,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And some late succour.
651,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
652,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.               Through long wanderings
653,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,We never once were parted. In his youth
654,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I deemed him honest, loved him as myself,"
655,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Nor doubted he should richly thrive and prosper
656,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Amongst the sons of men. But day by day
657,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The hand of opportunity unmasked
658,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The sleeping guilt within. Envy and greed,"
659,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Pitiless malice, pride, and wantonness"
660,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Started like lion's cubs that scent their prey
661,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And roared increasingly. Time drew aside
662,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Veil after veil that cloaked his villainy,"
663,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Till looking on his stark and naked soul
664,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I stood aghast and trembled.
665,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
666,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT.                       God, that made us,"
667,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Engraved his sacred image in our hearts
668,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Deeper than cruel eyes may boast to pierce.
669,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Has not my brother too a priceless soul
670,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For which Christ died? Did God not ransom it?
671,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Yes, I will find him, lift him to my breast"
672,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And say, ""Forget the past. Thy home is here."""
673,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
674,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. Beware! Didst thou embrace him he would die,"
675,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And he hath grievous penance yet to do
676,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Ere he be ripe for heaven. In purgatory
677,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The pains are doubly sharp and manifold
678,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With which our guilt is cleansed. Forbear to search.
679,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
680,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. This ministration is a task that heaven
681,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Now lays upon me. Hinder not his weal.
682,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,What better battle could approve my courage
683,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Than in a brother's soul to fight despair?
684,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If I could bring that brother back to life
685,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Long dead to me, and dead, it seems, to God,"
686,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Were't not a deed of Christian chivalry
687,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To win my lady by? Father, I pray thee,"
688,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Where is my brother now?
689,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
690,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                  A mystery
691,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Enshrouds his penance. Vain to question more.
692,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,A secret vow on which salvation hangs
693,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Lies between him and all men.
694,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
695,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.                      Marvellous!
696,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
697,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Where hath he roamed, what nameless sin committed"
698,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That I may not embrace him?
699,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
700,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT.                      Listen, Knight,"
701,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
702,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For I may tell thee that; and when thou knowest
703,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The sins he shrives and what his penance is,"
704,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Assist him with thy charitable prayers
705,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To bear his cross, but lift it not away,"
706,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For with it goes his hope of paradise.
707,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
708,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. There is indeed some mystery in this.
709,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The pain of it doth weigh upon thy soul
710,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Even in the telling.
711,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
712,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.              Did his own pale lips
713,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Read from the branded tablets of his heart
714,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The record of his sorrows, they could never"
715,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"More truly speak than I, for all his woes"
716,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I knew, and inly felt them as my own."
717,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Would that some ruffian knife had gashed his throat
718,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"On that foul day of slaughter, when thy mother"
719,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Bore thee afar to safety. Ah, how near"
720,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Salvation hung that day above his head!
721,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"But wondrously, as Isaac once was spared,"
722,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Some voice he heard not stayed the murderous hand,"
723,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Then dealing death abroad; and from that mercy
724,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The dreadful brood of all his torments sprang.
725,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
726,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They bound his wrists with painful twisted thongs
727,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And drove him with the flocks and captive women
728,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Into their camp, across the smouldering heaps"
729,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Of burning rubbish and through sulphurous fumes.
730,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That night he found him tied behind a cart--
731,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The crawling palace of that savage chief
732,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Whose greed had saved him. Shivering he stood,"
733,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For they had stripped him, through the starlight hours,"
734,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And found no piteous orb less bright above him
735,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For looking on his grief. Alas, his soul"
736,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Entered that night into the maze of hell.
737,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For gazing on those stars and on the corpses
738,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of all he loved and knew, mangled and bare,"
739,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Upbraiding heaven with their lidless eyes,"
740,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And heaven's eyes still smiling back at them,"
741,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He said to his cold heart, ""There is no God."""
742,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And when the rosy dawn with jocund seeming
743,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Gilded the valley as if naught had chanced,"
744,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He, like the morning, banished grief and love,"
745,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And in his vain and cruel heart repeating
746,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""There is no God,"" arose to greet the sun."
747,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"They took him to a village by a stream,"
748,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And in the market sold him to a Jew,"
749,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A long-robed man, who stroked thy brother's hair--"
750,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T was flaxen then and silken as thy own--
751,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And chuckled as he hurried him away
752,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Into a galley, by the margin moored."
753,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"They voyaged long, until they reached a vast"
754,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And splendid city. Egypt's sunken shore
755,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Stretches behind it, and before its walls"
756,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Pharos, by day a pillar and by night"
757,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"A flaming beacon, greets the mariner."
758,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T is Satan's capital. If holy men
759,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Have dwelt within it, teaching all the Church,"
760,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That was of old. Now Saracens and Jews
761,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Possess it wholly. There no Christian thrives,"
762,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But every monstrous and lascivious crime
763,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Findeth a palace or a den to hide it.
764,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"There did thy brother waste his youth, a slave,"
765,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And no unwilling service did he render
766,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To every base command. His shepherd's skin,"
767,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Ruddy with mountain suns, they smoothed with unguents,"
768,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And bleached in pillared courts; they shaved his hair,"
769,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Forbade him labour, save to hold a torch"
770,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"While his young masters read, or at the banquet"
771,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To mix the lucent sherbets with the snows
772,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of Sinai's deepest gorge, or in the censer"
773,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To drop large incense-grains. He learned to sing
774,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"What songs of wine their ribald poets penned,"
775,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And all the witch of Lesbos raved of love.
776,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The lute and timbrel in his skilful hands
777,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They loved to place; oft in their languid souls
778,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,His wild chant roused some savage memory
779,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And their hearts leapt like leopards in the night
780,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That prowl through broad Sahara. His delight
781,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Was henceforth the choice morsel, the fat fee,"
782,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The subtle theft. He brought the gossip home
783,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"From the loud market, lest his lord should yawn"
784,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The morning long beneath the barber's hands,"
785,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Nor praise his wit and to the tittering group
786,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Repeat his story. In the brothel streets
787,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He ran sly errands, nor escaped in fear"
788,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,If as he passed some wife of Potiphar
789,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Plucked at his tunic. His best art it was
790,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To know the cunning mixture of good wines
791,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And poisons too, if some adulterous slave"
792,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or long-lived uncle or importunate brother
793,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Needed a poison.--Close about his soul
794,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,This bitter flood of luxury crept up
795,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Until it choked him. He forgot the past
796,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And blushed to be a Christian. Their vain prayers
797,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He learned to mutter, and was circumcised."
798,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thrice in the day, and dawn and noon and eve,"
799,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He washed his feet and hands, a foolish rite"
800,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That left the soul still foul. Twice seven devils
801,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Lodged in his body and tormented him,"
802,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And lust pursued him when all ways of lust
803,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Were stale and sickened.
804,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
805,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But there came an end.
806,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"For by the flesh as he had chiefly sinned,"
807,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,So in the flesh he had his punishment.
808,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Ulcers and boils, to make another Job,"
809,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thickened upon him, and his beauty gone,"
810,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They drove him like a pest from all their gates
811,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Among the lepers. Then he called on God.
812,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Then he remembered all he once had heard
813,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But understood not touching Calvary;
814,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And rising up, all naked as he was,"
815,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,He plucked the stout stem of a bramble-bush
816,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"To be his palmer's staff, and with a rag"
817,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That once had been the blanket of a mule
818,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Girded his loins, and stalked into the wild."
819,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
820,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. And whither, father, whither did he go?"
821,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
822,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. Mount Sinai first received him, on whose crests"
823,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The Lord in the beginning reared his throne,"
824,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And from whose spurs and watered crevices
825,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The children of Saint Anthony for ever
826,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Pour praise and supplication. There he dwelt,"
827,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Recalling to his troubled memory
828,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The precepts of the faith; but from those haunts
829,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,He journeyed soon to deeper solitudes.
830,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
831,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. Then he repented and is surely saved?
832,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
833,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. God grant it, son, God grant it for thy sake."
834,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"'T is not a day can change the heart of man,"
835,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Though grace doth much. The ancient demons lurk
836,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Still in their dark recesses, and at night,"
837,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Or in the idle moments when the soul
838,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Breathes 'mid her travail, suddenly assail."
839,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In the vast wilderness the starving eye
840,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Spies many shapes that feed its lust. To me
841,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The buzz of bees, the lizard's sunny sleep,"
842,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The snake's lithe coils are full of languishment.
843,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Oh, how the base blood then assaults the heart"
844,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Crying, ""Fool, fool, what were the life of heaven"
845,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Unless in heaven too the sun were warm
846,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And the blood rose and all the passions flared,"
847,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Even as in worms compact of earth and fire
848,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That lecherously writhe? Their goads and stings
849,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Are in thy flesh, why not their ravishment?"""
850,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
851,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,They are strange shapes the devil sometimes takes.
852,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"There was a vine that crept along this wall,"
853,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Ancient and knotted; far its branches spread
854,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And with their leafy greenness made a bower
855,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Over my cell. The juicy clusters hung
856,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Not far above me, and the little birds"
857,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Chirped in the sun-flecked tangle all day long,"
858,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Hopping from twig to twig and carolling.
859,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I sat and listened, and methought they said:"
860,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""Bad hairy man, thou only in this world"
861,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Repinest, hater of thyself and us,"
862,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Thou art all nature's single enemy."""
863,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And with a doubt that cleft my heart in twain
864,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I sat and pondered what they sang to me.
865,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Then I looked up into the sunlit maze
866,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of that old vine, I breathed its subtle scent,"
867,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,I watched its spotted shadows shift and change
868,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With gusty murmurous tremblings of its leaves
869,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And eager tendrils, curling through the air,"
870,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Until it seemed as if the thing had life
871,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And was a devil stooping over me
872,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,With the obsession of his purring breath
873,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Wooing me to perdition. But I laughed,"
874,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,For I had dealt with imps of hell before.
875,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I searched the stubble till I found two flints,"
876,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Sharp and with something like a cross upon them,"
877,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And straight about the vine's outspreading roots
878,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Began to dig. A week, methinks, I dug"
879,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"With secret joy, well knowing that in vain"
880,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,The demon thought to ripen all his grapes.
881,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"His filthy roots, now dangling in the air,"
882,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Dried in the sun. In August fell the leaves,"
883,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And the dead branches with the autumn's flaw
884,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Rotted and broke; now, see, they feed my fire."
885,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And when the Spring returns no silly birds
886,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Will fret me with their singing. God be praise
887,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That I could balk that devil: long he mocked
888,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,My lonely penance with his evil eye.
889,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But others come anon; and what I suffer
890,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,'T is very like thy brother suffers too.
891,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
892,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. I cannot think so, father. Thou art weak"
893,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And long hast laid the hopes of youth aside.
894,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thou canst not love. My brother still is young--
895,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
896,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT. Alas, if grief had multiplied his years!"
897,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
898,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"KNIGHT. He yet can love, and any natural voice"
899,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of wood or mountain, or perchance my own,"
900,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Might wake in him another better life
901,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Of peace and happy hopes. We love the forest,"
902,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,We who were nurtured in its magic depths.
903,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Oft has it seemed as if God spoke to us
904,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,In the low voices of the prayerful boughs
905,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,That whisper nighest heaven.
906,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
907,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                         This false world
908,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Is naught, my son, but what we make of it."
909,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
910,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT. Then I must think my brother loves the woods
911,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And hears God's message in their murmuring.
912,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Had he dwelt here, a hermit like thyself,"
913,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,He would have suffered that old vine to grow
914,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And those blithe birds to sing. 'T is positive,"
915,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Else other blood than mine must fill his veins.
916,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Oh, I will find him yet.--I leave thee, father."
917,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Thou hast with heavy tidings and great hope
918,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Burdened my soul. Now I must journey on.
919,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"I pray, thy blessing."
920,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
921,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"HERMIT.               Kneel, thou happy stranger,"
922,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Kneel, for a vision comes into my heart"
923,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And I must prophesy. Thus saith the Lord:
924,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"""Thou shalt not know thy brother upon earth;"
925,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"My will forbids. But thou shalt pass him by,"
926,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"And as Saint Peter's shadow healed a man,"
927,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"The passing of thee, by my grace and mercy,"
928,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Shall save thy brother's soul."" This comfort take"
929,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And go thy ways.
930,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
931,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.               The will of God be done.
932,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"If not on earth, we yet may meet in heaven."
933,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
934,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT. God grant it.
935,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
936,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT.             May God keep thee.
937,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
938,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,HERMIT.                         Fare thee well.
939,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,
940,A HERMIT OF CARMEL,KNIGHT [_sings as he goes_].

1003,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"She went to him for shrift, and on that day"

1032,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Who knows but he is dead, thy pretty knight?"
1033,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,His time is up. Were he alive and true
1034,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"He had spurred home, hearing thy father's death,"
1035,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,To claim thee and make good his heritage.
1036,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,"Fie on this fondness, girl! It had been wiser"

1047,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,Ulric should not be master in these walls.
1048,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,But I should open arches in the tower

1054,A SEQUEL TO A HERMIT OF CARMEL,And summon better counsel to thy heart

1069,FLERIDA.,Day wanes: full summer's hanging in the air.
1070,FLERIDA.,"Oh, tarry not, my own."
1071,FLERIDA.,See! the first withered leaf is fallen there
1072,FLERIDA.,And I am here alone.
1073,FLERIDA.,Hath not my sorrow magic o'er thy breast?
1074,FLERIDA.,Hath not my weary plight
1075,FLERIDA.,The wings of love to fly into thy nest
1076,FLERIDA.,And reach thee in the night?
1077,FLERIDA.,"Come to me, Palmerin. Thy trial's o'er,"
1078,FLERIDA.,Thy knightly vow fulfilled.
1079,FLERIDA.,"Come before winter chokes the ways, before"
1080,FLERIDA.,My inmost soul is chilled.
1081,FLERIDA.,Where dost thou wander? From what lonely moor
1082,FLERIDA.,Dost thou salute this sun?
1083,FLERIDA.,Forget'st thou in gay courts what I endure?
1084,FLERIDA.,Lov'st thou some happier one?
1085,FLERIDA.,Weak woman! Can my doubting heart not wait
1086,FLERIDA.,While his true heart can fight?
1087,FLERIDA.,"Why should I falter while he fronts his fate,"
1088,FLERIDA.,Or mourn while he doth right?
1089,FLERIDA.,"Keep him, great world, till the white shield he bore"
1090,FLERIDA.,Be blazoned rich in pride.
1091,FLERIDA.,"Fear not to echo, deserts, he's no more,"

1099,FLERIDA.,And bid them raise the bridge. Some horsemen climb
1100,FLERIDA.,"The western hill. Make haste, or all is lost."
1101,FLERIDA.,"Young Hugh espied them from the northern tower,"
1102,FLERIDA.,And gave us warning.
1103,FLERIDA.,
1104,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.             Heaven hears my prayer.
1105,FLERIDA.,
1106,FLERIDA.,"NURSE. Madness. Come in. I prithee hasten, Hugh."
1107,FLERIDA.,"She 'll take thy word, though she mistrusts my oath"
1108,FLERIDA.,Who never lied to her in all these years

1116,FLERIDA.,
1117,FLERIDA.,HUGH.                        He had his helmet on.
1118,FLERIDA.,
1119,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA. Saw'st thou his shield?
1120,FLERIDA.,
1121,FLERIDA.,HUGH.                        It bore a rich device.
1122,FLERIDA.,But what I know not.
1123,FLERIDA.,
1124,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.              Came he mounted well?
1125,FLERIDA.,
1126,FLERIDA.,"HUGH. Right well, on a white steed. But at the turn"
1127,FLERIDA.,"Dismounted, and now leads the charger up."
1128,FLERIDA.,
1129,FLERIDA.,"NURSE. O God, 't is he! I know him by that sign."
1130,FLERIDA.,He always did so. [_A bugle is heard in the distance._

1149,FLERIDA.,"Oh, if I could, I'd rush to kiss his hands"
1150,FLERIDA.,Full half-way down the steep. Alas! these bones.
1151,FLERIDA.,
1152,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA. I, who have waited for him five long years,"
1153,FLERIDA.,May well be patient now. Here let him find me

1163,FLERIDA.,"NURSE. Oh, I must weep for joy! See, where he comes,"
1164,FLERIDA.,Not so much changed but I should know him still
1165,FLERIDA.,Among a thousand. Such a pretty child
1166,FLERIDA.,"As the knight was, and such a roguish boy!"
1167,FLERIDA.,Can this be Palmerin? Who could have fancied
1168,FLERIDA.,That he should ever be this stalwart man?
1169,FLERIDA.,
1170,FLERIDA.,
1171,FLERIDA.,
1172,FLERIDA.,"_Enter_ SIR PALMERIN, _who, seeing the lady_ FLERIDA,"

1176,FLERIDA.,
1177,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. Lady, hast thou forgotten Palmerin?"

1179,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA. Were memory dead, that voice would waken it."
1180,FLERIDA.,
1181,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. What mean these weeds, these arms?"
1182,FLERIDA.,
1183,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA.                       That thou, my liege,"
1184,FLERIDA.,Art master in this castle.
1185,FLERIDA.,
1186,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN.                Ah, thy father--"
1187,FLERIDA.,"How long have we been orphaned, Flerida?"
1188,FLERIDA.,
1189,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA. Ten moons have shed their light upon his grave.
1190,FLERIDA.,
1191,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. Oh, more than father--"
1192,FLERIDA.,
1193,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.                   And thou more than son
1194,FLERIDA.,Wast ever to him. He remembered thee
1195,FLERIDA.,"With his last breath, and bade me, when thou earnest,"
1196,FLERIDA.,"Render his arms, his vassals, and his towers"
1197,FLERIDA.,"Into thy hand. My lord, receive the keys. [_Kneels_."
1198,FLERIDA.,
1199,FLERIDA.,PALMERIN [_raising her_].
1200,FLERIDA.,"How gladly, if these keys unlock thy heart,"
1201,FLERIDA.,"Dear lady. For my prize is not these walls,"
1202,FLERIDA.,Nor these stout men and honourable arms.
1203,FLERIDA.,'T was not for them I served the Emperor
1204,FLERIDA.,In many a battle waged in heathen lands.
1205,FLERIDA.,'T was in the hope of what no strength of arm
1206,FLERIDA.,"Nor kingly favour, without grace of thine,"
1207,FLERIDA.,"Could win for any man. If thou canst love me,"
1208,FLERIDA.,I take all else to do thee homage with;
1209,FLERIDA.,"But if thy heart, in my long absence won"
1210,FLERIDA.,"By some more worthy suitor, would withdraw,"
1211,FLERIDA.,"Keep the rest too, for to be wretched in"
1212,FLERIDA.,I have this whole vast world for heritage.
1213,FLERIDA.,
1214,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA. My hand and heart my father plighted thee
1215,FLERIDA.,Upon the morning when he dubbed thee knight.
1216,FLERIDA.,"Both shall be true. If other ground were lacking,"
1217,FLERIDA.,My father's choice were ground enough for love.
1218,FLERIDA.,
1219,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. Nay, let not duty and thy father's will"
1220,FLERIDA.,Force thee to wed me. Bid thy heart pronounce.
1221,FLERIDA.,
1222,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA. A holy love is not the fancy's choice.
1223,FLERIDA.,"A mother cherishes the child she bore,"
1224,FLERIDA.,"Nature's dear gift, bestowed with many a pang"
1225,FLERIDA.,And weary vigil and sweet fluttering joy
1226,FLERIDA.,That flies over a sea of brooding care.
1227,FLERIDA.,"A father is not chosen but revered,"
1228,FLERIDA.,"For God appointed him. 'T is destiny,"
1229,FLERIDA.,"And no man's wayward will, binds brothers, kindred,"
1230,FLERIDA.,And childhood's friends in everlasting bonds.
1231,FLERIDA.,"Our native land we chose not, nor our king,"
1232,FLERIDA.,"Nor our first sovereign, God. All sacred ties"
1233,FLERIDA.,Are woven round us by the hand of heaven
1234,FLERIDA.,And therefore bear us up. Let homeless traitors
1235,FLERIDA.,"Reject their lot, like fallen Lucifer"
1236,FLERIDA.,Wretched 'neath every sky; let the false rabble
1237,FLERIDA.,Change with the moon its despicable chiefs;
1238,FLERIDA.,Let the vain fop and goaded libertine
1239,FLERIDA.,"Pick their poor pleasures, and adulterous spirits"
1240,FLERIDA.,Pursue a phantom down the drifts of hell.
1241,FLERIDA.,But we will breathe the air that quickened us
1242,FLERIDA.,"And see by this same light that gave us eyes,"
1243,FLERIDA.,"Here rooted where God sowed us, flowering here"
1244,FLERIDA.,"Where we have grown, making our constancy"
1245,FLERIDA.,A pivot for this wheeling universe.
1246,FLERIDA.,Ah! 't is a fickle and unholy fondness
1247,FLERIDA.,Springs from caprice of will. Who doteth once
1248,FLERIDA.,"May dote again, for who shall fetter fancy?"
1249,FLERIDA.,As thou couldst bare thy breast to fortune's arrows
1250,FLERIDA.,"Undaunted, for thy hope was all in God"
1251,FLERIDA.,"And life or death must crown it, so my bosom,"
1252,FLERIDA.,"Enshrining his good gifts, is satisfied"
1253,FLERIDA.,And cannot speak again. Him heaven gave me
1254,FLERIDA.,Shall be my lord and my unchangeable love.
1255,FLERIDA.,
1256,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. O constant lady! Let me then thank heaven,"
1257,FLERIDA.,That graced me with the treasure of thy troth.
1258,FLERIDA.,"Rejoice with me, my comrades. Say no more"
1259,FLERIDA.,"That time has parted us, and devious chances"
1260,FLERIDA.,"Governed our lives. How now, is this good Carl?"
1261,FLERIDA.,"And little Hugh, so grown? And thou, old gossip,"
1262,FLERIDA.,Goes thy rheum better now the season warms?
1263,FLERIDA.,But where is Ulric?
1264,FLERIDA.,
1265,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.              Thou shalt know anon.
1266,FLERIDA.,First bid the people give us leave awhile.
1267,FLERIDA.,
1268,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN. Make ready, then; we follow you."
1269,FLERIDA.,
1270,FLERIDA.,
1271,FLERIDA.,
1272,FLERIDA.,[_Exeunt all save_ PALMERIN _and_ FLERIDA.
1273,FLERIDA.,
1274,FLERIDA.,
1275,FLERIDA.,
1276,FLERIDA.,"Dear saint,"
1277,FLERIDA.,Is this a vision or a waking truth
1278,FLERIDA.,"In which I see thee, smiling on my hopes,"
1279,FLERIDA.,As only visions smile on Jack-a-dreams?
1280,FLERIDA.,How often have I dreamt between two battles
1281,FLERIDA.,Thou stoodest thus above me in the dusk
1282,FLERIDA.,"Half joy, half courage!"
1283,FLERIDA.,
1284,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA.                  Haply't was my prayer,"
1285,FLERIDA.,For prayer hath wings to travel in the night.
1286,FLERIDA.,
1287,FLERIDA.,PALMERIN. Didst thou remember
1288,FLERIDA.,
1289,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.                          Not as others pray.
1290,FLERIDA.,"What need of blessings to protest I loved thee,"
1291,FLERIDA.,When benediction rose with every breath
1292,FLERIDA.,"From my dumb heart to thee? Awake, adream,"
1293,FLERIDA.,"In woodland rambles or in household tasks,"
1294,FLERIDA.,"I moved in thy love's presence as in God's,"
1295,FLERIDA.,One deity to me.
1296,FLERIDA.,
1297,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN.           How undeserving,"
1298,FLERIDA.,"Fair angel, are my merits of thy love!"
1299,FLERIDA.,How could I win it!
1300,FLERIDA.,
1301,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA.            Ah, if God can love thee,"
1302,FLERIDA.,Why should a mortal give a cause for love?
1303,FLERIDA.,
1304,FLERIDA.,PALMERIN. They say God loves us all.
1305,FLERIDA.,
1306,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.                          Such pitying love
1307,FLERIDA.,Is his alone who knows the unsullied spirit
1308,FLERIDA.,"Shrouded at birth beneath this fleshly coil,"
1309,FLERIDA.,And can divine the stature of that virtue
1310,FLERIDA.,Each yet might climb to. But in thee declared
1311,FLERIDA.,"Shine, Palmerin, the hopes of all the world."
1312,FLERIDA.,What God beheld and destined when he called thee
1313,FLERIDA.,"Out of the void, he granted me to see"
1314,FLERIDA.,First through the haze of maiden dreams and now
1315,FLERIDA.,With the deep glance of woman.
1316,FLERIDA.,
1317,FLERIDA.,PALMERIN.                          Then in sooth
1318,FLERIDA.,"'T was no vain fancy, as the learned say,"
1319,FLERIDA.,That made thy silent presence cross my path
1320,FLERIDA.,"Where'er I turned, for if I slept my dream"
1321,FLERIDA.,"Painted thy smile, and when the vision fled"
1322,FLERIDA.,The sunlit fountain met me with thy gaze.
1323,FLERIDA.,"If the birds chirruped, it was _Flerida_,"
1324,FLERIDA.,And _Flerida_ if any minstrel sang.
1325,FLERIDA.,"Thy mien was in the lilies, the thin clouds"
1326,FLERIDA.,"Contrived thy garments' fashion, and thy courage"
1327,FLERIDA.,Breathed from the mountains to renew my soul.
1328,FLERIDA.,"Nor was there need, for in these tables here"
1329,FLERIDA.,"Thy name, thy looks, thy words, thy noble ways"
1330,FLERIDA.,"Were graven deep, and, as the gaudy shadows"
1331,FLERIDA.,"Stalked by me which men take for beauteous thing,"
1332,FLERIDA.,"I laughed to scorn each feeble counterfeit,"
1333,FLERIDA.,And cried to the sweet image in my soul
1334,FLERIDA.,How much more bright thou wast and beautiful.
1335,FLERIDA.,Little I thought the love that brought me blessing
1336,FLERIDA.,Brought sorrow here to thee.
1337,FLERIDA.,
1338,FLERIDA.,FLERIDA.                      If it brought sorrow
1339,FLERIDA.,That grief was consecrate and offered up
1340,FLERIDA.,To aid thy noble venture. 'T was my hope
1341,FLERIDA.,That thy young sinews in a dreamless sleep
1342,FLERIDA.,"Might knit them for the battle, while my vigils"
1343,FLERIDA.,"Kept trimmed thy spirit's lamp; so might thy valour,"
1344,FLERIDA.,"Fed on my sorrow's riches, greet the morn"
1345,FLERIDA.,With more unsullied and resplendent rays
1346,FLERIDA.,"Than her own shining, and the wondering world"
1347,FLERIDA.,"Should praise thy happy courage, little knowing"
1348,FLERIDA.,The hidden might of love that nerved thy arm
1349,FLERIDA.,And taught thy blithe soul singing.
1350,FLERIDA.,
1351,FLERIDA.,"PALMERIN.                           Flerida,"
1352,FLERIDA.,"Though I should give thee all ray life and blood,"
1353,FLERIDA.,"My honour and immortal soul, 't were nothing"
1354,FLERIDA.,"By what thou gavest first, and rendering all"

1356,FLERIDA.,Of having lived and loved thee.

1376,FLERIDA.,
1377,FLERIDA.,"FLERIDA. No priest is in attendance, Palmerin."
1378,FLERIDA.,Till one be duly summoned and arrive
1379,FLERIDA.,I am my father's hostage in thy hands

1384,FLERIDA.,While I am still an exile from thy bosom.
1385,FLERIDA.,Let me not change the canopy of heaven
1386,FLERIDA.,Except for heaven's self. Before this shrine

1454,SONG.,"I must not wait, but bend to be his wife."
1455,SONG.,

1457,SONG.,Only some madness could transform his soul
1458,SONG.,So utterly.
1459,SONG.,
1460,SONG.,"FLERIDA. I question not the cause,"
1461,SONG.,
1462,SONG.,I mark the deed and brand the infamy.
1463,SONG.,"When he had spoken and beheld me firm,"
1464,SONG.,The coward threatened force. We were alone
1465,SONG.,"And he unarmed; it was a woman's body,"
1466,SONG.,"Not a man's soul, he thought to cope withal."
1467,SONG.,My father's sword was hanging by the wall:
1468,SONG.,"I drew the blade, and as he rushed to snatch it"
1469,SONG.,Transfixed his body; at my feet he fell
1470,SONG.,Writhing; I cried for help. Then Gunther came
1471,SONG.,"And the young Hugh. I published his offence,"
1472,SONG.,"And when the torment and the fever passed,"
1473,SONG.,"For my poor strength had left some breath in him,"
1474,SONG.,Fettered and manacled they brought him forth
1475,SONG.,"Into the hall, before my men-at-arms"
1476,SONG.,And the red witness of his own foul blood
1477,SONG.,Staining the hearthstone; and I spoke and said:
1478,SONG.,"""Unhappy Ulric, traitor to thy liege,"
1479,SONG.,"Whom on the cross thou tookest oath to serve,"
1480,SONG.,Thou shalt await his sentence. When he comes
1481,SONG.,He shall know all and will decree thy forfeit.
1482,SONG.,"But if he come not, thou shalt live in chains"
1483,SONG.,"Till God and death restore thy liberty."""
1484,SONG.,
1485,SONG.,PALMERIN. Is he still captive?
1486,SONG.,
1487,SONG.,"FLERIDA.                  In the northern tower,"
1488,SONG.,"Whence Hugh but now, whom Christian charity"
1489,SONG.,"Prompts oft to visit our sad prisoner,"
1490,SONG.,Saw thee approach. Ulric has heard the news.
1491,SONG.,
1492,SONG.,PALMERIN. Let him be brought.
1493,SONG.,
1494,SONG.,FLERIDA [_to the men-at-arms_]. You hear my lord's command.--
1495,SONG.,"Ah, Palmerin, when Christ returns to earth"
1496,SONG.,Only the good shall welcome him; thy coming
1497,SONG.,"Will bring thy faithless servant also joy,"
1498,SONG.,"For I foresee thy sentence,"
1499,SONG.,
1500,SONG.,PALMERIN.                   To be merciful
1501,SONG.,Is to be truly just.--Has he not mended
1502,SONG.,Or purged his sin in his captivity?
1503,SONG.,
1504,SONG.,"FLERIDA. Indeed, it seems he has. Hugh and the friar"
1505,SONG.,Who daily visits him both bring report
1506,SONG.,Of many pious and profound discourses
1507,SONG.,With which he charms away his solitude.
1508,SONG.,God grant his wisdom may outlive its cause
1509,SONG.,"And not forsake him now. For, see, he comes."

1519,SONG.,[ULRIC _is freed._

1523,SONG.,'T were idle to rehearse that history.
1524,SONG.,"Only one matter, past my understanding,"
1525,SONG.,I ask thee to confess: how came thy soul
1526,SONG.,To harbour thoughts so opposite to thine
1527,SONG.,And do thy nobleness this injury?
1528,SONG.,
1529,SONG.,ULRIC. Alas! The saddest sorrow of the world
1530,SONG.,"Is not foul sin, but that resplendent virtue"
1531,SONG.,"That yet brings evil on. 'T was nothing base,"
1532,SONG.,"Hideous, ignoble, or contemptible"
1533,SONG.,"That led me to my ruin, but the might"
1534,SONG.,"Of perfect sweetness, joy unthinkable,"
1535,SONG.,And infinite deserts_;_ it was the hunger
1536,SONG.,For what most truly merits to be loved.
1537,SONG.,"'T was love, my lord, the love of Flerida"
1538,SONG.,"Which, in thy bosom waking heaven's choirs,"
1539,SONG.,Brought hell into my breast. Was not her face
1540,SONG.,As fair for me as thee to look upon?
1541,SONG.,Was not her silver voice and high discourse
1542,SONG.,Potent with reason on my listening ears?
1543,SONG.,Why was it criminal in me to love
1544,SONG.,"And in thee lawful? For we both were men,"
1545,SONG.,"And I the elder and the better born,"
1546,SONG.,Who might have wooed and won her worthily.
1547,SONG.,"Yet with no other crime than lucklessness,"
1548,SONG.,Because her father and her constant soul
1549,SONG.,"Lit first on thee, the tempest of my love"
1550,SONG.,"Wrecked honour, faith, fame, life, and hope of heaven,"
1551,SONG.,"Which, had the winds blown gently on my fortunes,"
1552,SONG.,The self-same love had blessed and glorified.
1553,SONG.,
1554,SONG.,PALMERIN. I pity thee; but summon not thy love
1555,SONG.,"To shield thy shame. Hadst thou been fortunate,"
1556,SONG.,Should I with cunning and outrageous hand
1557,SONG.,"Have moved against thy peace? Nay, by God's mercy,"
1558,SONG.,"I should have gone my way, and patiently"
1559,SONG.,In other worlds have justified my soul;
1560,SONG.,For sorrow more religiously than love
1561,SONG.,Counselleth mortals.
1562,SONG.,
1563,SONG.,"ULRIC.             Ah, I loved too much."
1564,SONG.,
1565,SONG.,"PALMERIN. Thou sayest well, Too much. Not that thy love"
1566,SONG.,In sweetness or in silent potency
1567,SONG.,Of grief surpassed or mine or any man's.
1568,SONG.,"But finding in thy spirit no defence,"
1569,SONG.,"Love fattened on thy reason, drank thy will,"
1570,SONG.,"And quite consumed thy being; growing great,"
1571,SONG.,"It left thee little, as, when a fiery wind"
1572,SONG.,"Devours the stubble, both together perish"
1573,SONG.,"And all goes out in shame. Water these ashes,"
1574,SONG.,"Ulric, with warm and consecrated tears,"
1575,SONG.,That haply some new sweetness thence arise
1576,SONG.,"Beneath another heaven. Though thou leave us,"
1577,SONG.,Our hearts will not forget thee. In thy prayers
1578,SONG.,"Remember us, and use thy freedom well."
1579,SONG.,
1580,SONG.,"ULRIC. I thank thee for thy counsel and thy mercy,"
1581,SONG.,"Generous knight. Not comfortless I go,"
1582,SONG.,"For not thy lips alone, well catechised,"
1583,SONG.,"Forgive me, Palmerin: thy heart forgives."
1584,SONG.,I would not use my freedom now to rove
1585,SONG.,But to ascend. A cloister's little earth
1586,SONG.,Is covered by the whole wide firmament.

1588,SONG.,"An anchorite, that I may outwardly"
1589,SONG.,Become a breathing symbol and a hand
1590,SONG.,"Pointing to heaven, become a lamp of love"

1592,SONG.,"Burning before the altar, till my blood,"
1593,SONG.,"Its living oil, to light refine its fire"

1595,SONG.,"And at this parting let me bless thee, lady,"
1596,SONG.,Angel God chose to save me from my sin
1597,SONG.,Even by tempting me. For in the storm
1598,SONG.,And fury of my madness thy calm eyes
1599,SONG.,"That unaware had called me, as the moon"
1600,SONG.,"Summons the leaping sea to follow her,"
1601,SONG.,Soon with quick bolt and soul-transfixing ire
1602,SONG.,"Awaked me from my dream. For who was I,"
1603,SONG.,That I should lift me to so pure a being
1604,SONG.,"Except in adoration, as the wave"
1605,SONG.,That mirrors in its slimy breast the glory
1606,SONG.,"Of some clear star, soon, grateful for that light,"
1607,SONG.,"Sinks, moaning, to its restless element."
1608,SONG.,"So moaned I, in my dungeon's loneliness"
1609,SONG.,"And in that larger solitude, the world,"
1610,SONG.,Where now no joy remained to beckon me.
1611,SONG.,"I cried to Nature, questioned sun and moon,"
1612,SONG.,At my cell's bars celestial visitants;
1613,SONG.,"Yes, I importuned my own soul to tell me"
1614,SONG.,Whether a man be born to look on good
1615,SONG.,And straightway perish. Long I questioned fate.
1616,SONG.,No answer came from heaven to my doubts;
1617,SONG.,But with the Spring and the reviving note
1618,SONG.,"Of thrush and swallow, and the ploughman's song"
1619,SONG.,"Heard from the fields, I somewhat calmed my griefs,"
1620,SONG.,And my heart took new counsel. Though a wave
1621,SONG.,"Mirror a star and sink into the sea,"
1622,SONG.,It cannot suffer; though the summer fade
1623,SONG.,It shivers not at autumn; though the spheres
1624,SONG.,Crash back to chaos they lament it not.
1625,SONG.,Never the blasted deserts of the moon
1626,SONG.,Mourned their lost verdure or implored reprieve.
1627,SONG.,"But my loud heart-beats, self-contemplative,"
1628,SONG.,"Note their own weariness, and death foreknown"
1629,SONG.,Makes life a grim and halting agony.
1630,SONG.,Yet something in me rides on circumstance
1631,SONG.,And swims the tide of change. How should that die
1632,SONG.,"Which knows its dying, or that pine and fade"
1633,SONG.,Which marks the shrivelled leafage of the year?
1634,SONG.,Can ashes choke that voice to lying silence
1635,SONG.,Which once has said: I love? That truth must live
1636,SONG.,"Though unremembered, and that splendour shine"
1637,SONG.,Though all eyes close in sleep. When first I loved thee
1638,SONG.,Something immortal darted through my flesh
1639,SONG.,And made me godlike. Henceforth all of me
1640,SONG.,"That loved thee, all of thee my puissant love"
1641,SONG.,Hedging with worship rescued from the void
1642,SONG.,"Lives in eternity, a part of God,"
1643,SONG.,Who feeds with earth's unquenchable desire
1644,SONG.,"The skies' ethereal altar, to whose flame"
1645,SONG.,"Passions are brands, thoughts smoke and frankincense,"
1646,SONG.,Nations and worlds unceasing hecatombs.
1647,SONG.,"There, growing one with all that ravished me,"
1648,SONG.,I also bum and never cease from love.
1649,SONG.,"Farewell, sweet lady. For thy pity thanks,"
1650,SONG.,"More thanks for thy disdain, but for thy beauty"
1651,SONG.,"Infinite thanks, for it was infinite"
1652,SONG.,"And, while it blinded most, unsealed mine eyes."

1678,SONG.,"FLERIDA. Let me gaze long upon thee ere I go,"

1680,SONG.,And weep anew and be disconsolate.
1681,SONG.,
1682,SONG.,"PALMERIN. Ah, were I only lying by thy side"
1683,SONG.,"At the first checking of thy peaceful breath,"
1684,SONG.,To chase away that doubt before it grieved thee
1685,SONG.,And with two kisses close thy dreamful eyes!
1686,SONG.,"Alas that we should meet to part, and love"
1687,SONG.,Only to be divided!
1688,SONG.,
1689,SONG.,"FLERIDA.             Palmerin,"
1690,SONG.,"Though thou hast faced the world and conquered it,"
1691,SONG.,Thy noble heart is young. My briefer years
1692,SONG.,And lonely life have farther traced the thread
1693,SONG.,By which fate guides us through this labyrinth.
1694,SONG.,"To learn to part, to learn to be divided,"
1695,SONG.,We meet and love on earth; to learn to die
1696,SONG.,Is the one triumph of the life of prayer.
1697,SONG.,"Shall love be but to hug the mother's breast,"
1698,SONG.,Or else run wailing? To prolong for ever
1699,SONG.,"The lovers' kiss, or pine for blandishments?"
1700,SONG.,Is the Lord's body but unleavened bread
1701,SONG.,"Weighed with a baker's measure, or his blood"
1702,SONG.,Wine to be drunk in bumpers? And shall love
1703,SONG.,"Be reckoned in embraces, and its grace"
1704,SONG.,Die with the taking of its sacrament?
1705,SONG.,These be but symbols to the eye of time
1706,SONG.,Of secrets written in eternity.
1707,SONG.,"The love that fed must wean the nourished soul,"
1708,SONG.,And through the dark and narrow vale of death
1709,SONG.,Send forth the lover lone but panoplied.
1710,SONG.,Else life were vain and love a moment's trouble
1711,SONG.,"That, passing, left untenanted the void,"
1712,SONG.,As summer winds a-tremble in this bower
1713,SONG.,Might waft some fragrance from a rifled rose
1714,SONG.,Through yonder gulf of night and nothingness.
1715,SONG.,"Hadst thou in battle fallen, were my soul"

1717,SONG.,Would Flerida have mocked thy constancy?
1718,SONG.,"Banish such thoughts, dear master of my being,"
1719,SONG.,From thy immortal soul. These fond enchantments
1720,SONG.,Make the sweet holiday and youth of love;
1721,SONG.,They are a largess and bright boon of heaven
1722,SONG.,"To sweeten our resolves. But youth will fade,"
1723,SONG.,"And death, not mowing with a two-edged scythe,"
1724,SONG.,Will cut down one and leave the other bowing
1725,SONG.,Before the wintry wind. Arm not with terror
1726,SONG.,"That swift, unheralded, insidious foe,"
1727,SONG.,But let him find our love invulnerable
1728,SONG.,And our heart's treasure in eternal hands.

1900,SYBARIS,"Lap, ripple, lap, Icarian wave, the sand"
1901,SYBARIS,Along the ruins of this piteous land;
1902,SYBARIS,"Murmur the praises of a lost delight,"
1903,SYBARIS,And soothe the aching of my starved sight
1904,SYBARIS,"With sheen of mirrored beauties, caught aright."
1905,SYBARIS,
1906,SYBARIS,"Here stood enchanted palaces of old,"
1907,SYBARIS,All veined porphyry and burnished gold;
1908,SYBARIS,Here matrons and slight maidens sat aloof
1909,SYBARIS,"Beneath cool porches, rich with Tyrian woof"
1910,SYBARIS,Hung from the carven rafters of the roof.
1911,SYBARIS,
1912,SYBARIS,Here in the mart a swarthy turbaned brave
1913,SYBARIS,Showed the wrought blade or praised the naked slave.
1914,SYBARIS,"""Touch with your finger-tips this edge of steel,"""
1915,SYBARIS,"Quoth he, ""and see this lad, from head to heel"
1916,SYBARIS,"Like a bronze Cupid. Feel, my masters, feel."""
1917,SYBARIS,
1918,SYBARIS,Here Aphrodite filled with frenzied love
1919,SYBARIS,The dark recesses of her murmurous grove.
1920,SYBARIS,"The doves that haunted it, the winds that sighed,"
1921,SYBARIS,"Were souls of youths that in her coverts died,"
1922,SYBARIS,And hopes of heroes strewed her garden wide.
1923,SYBARIS,
1924,SYBARIS,Under her shades a narrow brazen gate
1925,SYBARIS,Led to the courts of Ares and of Fate.
1926,SYBARIS,Who entered breathed the unutterable prayer
1927,SYBARIS,"Of cruel hearts, and death was worshipped there,"
1928,SYBARIS,And men went thence enfranchised by despair.
1929,SYBARIS,
1930,SYBARIS,"Here the proud athlete in the baths delayed,"
1931,SYBARIS,"While a cool fountain on his shoulders played,"
1932,SYBARIS,"Then in fine linen swathed his breast and thighs,"
1933,SYBARIS,"And silent, myrtle-crowned, with serious eyes,"
1934,SYBARIS,Stepped forth to list the wranglings of the wise.
1935,SYBARIS,
1936,SYBARIS,"A sage stalked by, his ragged mantle bound"
1937,SYBARIS,About his brows; his eyes perused the ground;
1938,SYBARIS,He conned the number of the cube and square
1939,SYBARIS,Of the moon's orb; his horny feet and bare
1940,SYBARIS,Trampled the lilies carpeting the stair.
1941,SYBARIS,
1942,SYBARIS,A jasper terrace hung above the sea
1943,SYBARIS,Where the King supped with his beloved three:
1944,SYBARIS,The Libyan chanted of her native land
1945,SYBARIS,"In raucous melody, the Indian fanned,"
1946,SYBARIS,And the huge mastiff licked his master's hand.
1947,SYBARIS,
1948,SYBARIS,"Below, alone, despairing of the gale,"
1949,SYBARIS,A crouching sailor furled the saffron sail;
1950,SYBARIS,"Then rose, breathed deep, and plunged in the lagoon."
1951,SYBARIS,A mermaid spied his glistening limbs: her croon
1952,SYBARIS,Enticed him down; her cold arms choked him soon.
1953,SYBARIS,
1954,SYBARIS,"And the King laughed, filled full his jewelled bowl,"
1955,SYBARIS,"And drinking cried: ""What know we of the soul?"
1956,SYBARIS,What number addeth to her harmony
1957,SYBARIS,"These drops of vintage that attune her key,"
1958,SYBARIS,Or those of brine that set the wretched free?
1959,SYBARIS,
1960,SYBARIS,"""If death should change me, as old fables feign,"
1961,SYBARIS,"Into some slave or beast, to purge with pain"
1962,SYBARIS,"My lordly pleasures, let my torment be"
1963,SYBARIS,"Still to behold thee, Sybaris, and see"
1964,SYBARIS,The sacred horror of thy loves and thee.
1965,SYBARIS,
1966,SYBARIS,"""Be thou my hell, my dumb eternal grief,"
1967,SYBARIS,"But spare thy King the madness of belief,"
1968,SYBARIS,The brutish faith of ignorant desire
1969,SYBARIS,That strives and wanders. Let the visible fire
1970,SYBARIS,Of beauty torture me. That doom is higher.
1971,SYBARIS,
1972,SYBARIS,"""I wear the crown of life. The rose and gem"
1973,SYBARIS,Twine with the pale gold of my diadem.
1974,SYBARIS,"Nature, long secret, hath unveiled to me"
1975,SYBARIS,And proved her vile. Her wanton bosoms be
1976,SYBARIS,"My pillow now. I know her, I am free."""
1977,SYBARIS,
1978,SYBARIS,"He spoke, and smiling stretched a languid hand,"
1979,SYBARIS,And music burst in mighty chords and bland
1980,SYBARIS,Of harp and flute and cymbal.--When between
1981,SYBARIS,"Two cypresses the large moon rose, her sheen"
1982,SYBARIS,"Silvered the nymphs' feet, tripping o'er the green."

1992,AVILA,Again my feet are on the fragrant moor
1993,AVILA,"Amid the purple uplands of Castile,"
1994,AVILA,"Realm proudly desolate and nobly poor,"
1995,AVILA,Scorched by the sky's inexorable zeal.
1996,AVILA,
1997,AVILA,Wide desert where a diadem of towers
1998,AVILA,"Above Adajar hems a silent town,"
1999,AVILA,"And locks, unmindful of the mocking hours,"
2000,AVILA,Her twenty temples in a granite crown.
2001,AVILA,
2002,AVILA,"The shafts of fervid light are in the sky,"
2003,AVILA,And in my heart the mysteries of yore.
2004,AVILA,Here the sad trophies of my spirit lie:
2005,AVILA,These dead fulfilled my destiny before.
2006,AVILA,
2007,AVILA,"Like huge primeval stones that strew this plain,"
2008,AVILA,"Their nameless sorrows sink upon my breast,"
2009,AVILA,And like this ardent sky their cancelled pain
2010,AVILA,Smiles at my grief and quiets my unrest.
2011,AVILA,
2012,AVILA,For here hath mortal life from age to age
2013,AVILA,"Endured the silent hand that makes and mars,"
2014,AVILA,"And, sighing, taken up its heritage"
2015,AVILA,Beneath the smiling and inhuman stars.
2016,AVILA,
2017,AVILA,"Still o'er this town the crested castle stands,"
2018,AVILA,"A nest for storks, as once for haughty souls;"
2019,AVILA,"Still from the abbey, where the vale expands,"
2020,AVILA,"The curfew for the long departed tolls,"
2021,AVILA,
2022,AVILA,Wafting some ghostly blessing to the heart
2023,AVILA,"From prayer of nun or silent Capuchin,"
2024,AVILA,To heal with balm of Golgotha the smart
2025,AVILA,Of weary labour and distracted sin.
2026,AVILA,
2027,AVILA,What fate has cast me on a tide of time
2028,AVILA,"Careless of joy and covetous of gold,"
2029,AVILA,What force compelled to weave the pensive rhyme
2030,AVILA,"When loves are mean, and faith and honour old,"
2031,AVILA,
2032,AVILA,"When riches crown in vain men's sordid lives,"
2033,AVILA,And learning chokes a mind of base degree?
2034,AVILA,What winged spirit rises from their hives?
2035,AVILA,"What heart, revolting, ventures to be free?"
2036,AVILA,
2037,AVILA,Their pride will sink and more ignobly fade
2038,AVILA,Without memorial of its hectic fire.
2039,AVILA,"What altars shall survive them, where they prayed?"
2040,AVILA,What lovely deities? What riven lyre?
2041,AVILA,
2042,AVILA,"Tarry not, pilgrim, but with inward gaze"
2043,AVILA,"Pass daily, musing, where their prisons are,"
2044,AVILA,And o'er the ocean of their babble raise
2045,AVILA,Thy voice in greeting to thy changeless star.
2046,AVILA,
2047,AVILA,"Abroad a tumult, and a ruin here;"
2048,AVILA,Nor world nor desert hath a home for thee.
2049,AVILA,Out of the sorrows of the barren year
2050,AVILA,Build thou thy dwelling in eternity.
2051,AVILA,
2052,AVILA,"Let patience, faith's wise sister, be thy heaven,"
2053,AVILA,And with high thoughts necessity alloy.
2054,AVILA,"Love is enough, and love is ever given,"
2055,AVILA,While fleeting days bring gift of fleeting joy.
2056,AVILA,
2057,AVILA,The little pleasures that to catch the sun
2058,AVILA,"Bubble a moment up from being's deep,"
2059,AVILA,"The glittering sands of passion as they run,"
2060,AVILA,"The merry laughter and the happy sleep,--"
2061,AVILA,
2062,AVILA,"These are the gems that, like the stars on fire,"
2063,AVILA,Encrust with glory all our heaven's zones;
2064,AVILA,"Each shining atom, in itself entire,"
2065,AVILA,"Brightens the galaxy of sister stones,"
2066,AVILA,
2067,AVILA,Dust of a world that crumbled when God's dream
2068,AVILA,"To throbbing pulses broke the life of things,"
2069,AVILA,And mingled with the void the scattered gleam
2070,AVILA,"Of many orbs that move in many rings,"
2071,AVILA,
2072,AVILA,Perchance at last into the parent sun
2073,AVILA,"To fall again and reunite their rays,"
2074,AVILA,When God awakes and gathers into one
2075,AVILA,The light of all his loves and all his days.

2088,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Their heads, in a more constant faith than man':"
2089,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2090,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The College gathers, and the courtly prayer"
2091,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Is answered still by hymn and organ-groan;
2092,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The beauty and the mystery are there,"
2093,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The Virgin and Saint Nicholas are gone.
2094,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2095,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Not one _Ora pro nobis_ bids them pause
2096,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"In their far flight, to hear this anthem roll;"
2097,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"No heart, of all that the King's relic awes,"
2098,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Sings _Requiescat_ to his mournful soul.
2099,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2100,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,No grain of incense thrown upon the embers
2101,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Of their cold hearth, no lamp in witness hung"
2102,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Before their image. One alone remembers;
2103,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Only the stranger knows their mother tongue.
2104,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2105,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Long rows of tapers light the people's places;
2106,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The little choristers may read, and mark"
2107,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The rhythmic fall; I see their wondering faces;
2108,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Only the altar--like the soul--is dark.
2109,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2110,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Ye floating voices through these arches ringing
2111,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"With measured music, subtle, sweet, and strong,"
2112,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Feel ye the inmost reason of your singing?
2113,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Know ye the ancient burden of your song?
2114,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2115,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The twilight deepens, and the blood-dyed glories"
2116,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Of all these fiery blazonings are dim.
2117,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Oh, they are jumbled, sad, forgotten stories!"
2118,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Why should ye read them, children? Chant your hymn."
2119,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2120,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,But I must con them while the rays of even
2121,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Kindle aloft some fading jewel-gleam
2122,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And the vast windows glow a peopled heaven,"
2123,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Rich with the gathering pageant of my dream.
2124,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2125,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Eden I see, where from the leafy cover"
2126,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The green-eyed snake begins to uncoil his length
2127,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And whispers to the woman and her lover,"
2128,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"As they lie musing, large, in peaceful strength."
2129,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2130,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"I see their children, bent with toil and terror,"
2131,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Lurking in caves, or heaping madly on"
2132,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The stones of Babel, or the endless error"
2133,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Of Sodom, Nineveh, and Babylon."
2134,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2135,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Here the Egyptian, wedding life with death,"
2136,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Flies from the sun into his painted tomb,"
2137,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And winds the secret of his antique faith
2138,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Tight in his shroud, and seals in sterile gloom."
2139,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2140,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,There the bold prophets of the heart's desire
2141,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Hail the new Zion God shall build for them,"
2142,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And rapt Isaiah strikes the heavenly lyre,"
2143,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And Jeremiah mourns Jerusalem.
2144,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2145,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Here David's daughter, full of grace and truth,"
2146,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Kneels in the temple, waiting for the Lord;"
2147,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"With the first _Ave_ comes the wing√®d youth,"
2148,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Bringing the lily ere he bring the sword.
2149,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2150,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"There, to behold the Mother and the Child,"
2151,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The sturdy shepherds down the mountain plod,"
2152,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And angels sing, with voices sweet and wild"
2153,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And wide lips parted: ""Glory be to God."""
2154,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2155,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Here, mounted on an ass, the twain depart"
2156,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"To hallowed Egypt, safe from Herod's wrong;"
2157,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And Mary ponders all things in her heart,"
2158,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And pensive Joseph sadly walks along.
2159,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2160,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"There with the Twelve, before his blood is shed,"
2161,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Christ blesses bread and breaks it with his hands,"
2162,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"""This is my body."" Thomas shakes his head,"
2163,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"They marvel all, and no one understands,"
2164,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2165,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Save John, whom Jesus loved above the rest."
2166,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"He marvels too, but, seeking naught beside,"
2167,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Leans, as his wont is, on his Master's breast."
2168,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Ah! the Lord's body also should abide.
2169,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2170,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,There Golgotha is dark against the blue
2171,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"In the broad east, above the painted crowd,"
2172,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And many look upon the sign, but few"
2173,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Read the hard lesson of the cross aloud.
2174,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2175,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And from this altar, now an empty tomb,"
2176,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The Lord is risen. Lo! he is not here.
2177,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"No shining angel sitteth in the gloom,"
2178,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,No Magdalen in anguish draweth near.
2179,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2180,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"All pure in heart, or all in aspect pure,"
2181,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The seemly Christians, kneeling, line the choir,"
2182,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And drop their eyelids, tender and demure,"
2183,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,As the low lingering harmonies expire.
2184,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2185,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,In that _Amen_ are the last echoes blended
2186,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Of all the ghostly world. The shades depart
2187,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Into the sacred night. In peace is ended
2188,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The long delirious fever of the heart.
2189,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2190,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Then I go forth into the open wold
2191,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And breathe the vigour of the freshening wind,"
2192,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And with the piling drift of cloud I hold
2193,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"A worship sweeter to the homeless mind,"
2194,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2195,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Where the squat willows with their osiers crowned
2196,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Border the humble reaches of the Cam,"
2197,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And the deep meadows stretching far around
2198,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Make me forget the exile that I am,--"
2199,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2200,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Exile not only from the wind-swept moor
2201,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Where Guadarrama lifts his purple crest,"
2202,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"But from the spirit's realm, celestial, sure"
2203,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Goal of all hope and vision of the best.
2204,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2205,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"They also will go forth, these gentle youths,"
2206,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Strong in the virtues of their manful isle,"
2207,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Till one the pathway of the forest smooths,"
2208,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"And one the Ganges rules, and one the Nile"
2209,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2210,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,And to whatever wilderness they choose
2211,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Their hearts will bear the sanctities of home,"
2212,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The perfect ardours of the Grecian Muse,"
2213,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The mighty labour of the arms of Rome;
2214,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2215,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"But, ah! how little of these storied walls"
2216,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Beneath whose shadow all their nurture was!
2217,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"No, not one passing memory recalls"
2218,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The Blessed Mary and Saint Nicholas.
2219,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2220,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Unhappy King, look not upon these towers,"
2221,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Remember not thine only work that grew.
2222,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The moving world that feeds thy gift devours,"

2703,THE ANGEL,And plunging deep into the balmy blue.
2704,THE ANGEL,Bid thy vain cares adieu
2705,THE ANGEL,"And say farewell to earth, thy foster-mother."
2706,THE ANGEL,"She hath befooled thee long,"
2707,THE ANGEL,And fondly thought to smother
2708,THE ANGEL,The sweet and cruel laughter of my song
2709,THE ANGEL,"Which the stars sing together, and the throng"
2710,THE ANGEL,Of seraphs ever shout to one another.
2711,THE ANGEL,"Come, heaven-chosen brother,"
2712,THE ANGEL,"Dear kinsman, come along."
2713,THE ANGEL,
2714,THE SOUL,THE SOUL
2715,THE SOUL,
2716,THE SOUL,To what fields beside what rivers
2717,THE SOUL,"Dost thou beckon me, fair love?"
2718,THE SOUL,With no sprinkled stars above
2719,THE SOUL,"Is high heaven seen? Or quivers,"
2720,THE SOUL,"With no changes of the moon,"
2721,THE SOUL,Her bright path athwart the pool?
2722,THE SOUL,Is thy strange world beautiful?
2723,THE SOUL,"Tell me true, before I shake"
2724,THE SOUL,From my sense this heavy swoon.
2725,THE SOUL,"Tell me true, lest I awake"
2726,THE SOUL,"Into deeper dreams, poor fool,"
2727,THE SOUL,And rejoice for nothing's sake.
2728,THE SOUL,
2729,THE ANGEL,THE ANGEL
2730,THE ANGEL,
2731,THE ANGEL,For mortals life and truth
2732,THE ANGEL,"Are things apart, nor when the first is done"
2733,THE ANGEL,Know they the other; for their lusty youth
2734,THE ANGEL,"Is madness, and their age oblivion."
2735,THE ANGEL,But henceforth thou art one
2736,THE ANGEL,"With the supernal mind,"
2737,THE ANGEL,"Not born in labour nor in death resigned,"
2738,THE ANGEL,"The life of all that live,"
2739,THE ANGEL,"The light by whose eclipse the world is blind,"
2740,THE ANGEL,"The truth of all that know,"
2741,THE ANGEL,"The joy for which we grieve,"
2742,THE ANGEL,And the untasted sweet that makes our woe.
2743,THE ANGEL,Now thou hast drained the wine
2744,THE ANGEL,Shatter the glass.
2745,THE ANGEL,"The music was divine,"
2746,THE ANGEL,Let the voice pass.
2747,THE ANGEL,Linger not in the host
2748,THE ANGEL,Of the long lost
2749,THE ANGEL,Bidding the dying bring
2750,THE ANGEL,"Meal-cakes and fruit, and sing"
2751,THE ANGEL,To cheer thy ghost.
2752,THE ANGEL,But be the living joy
2753,THE ANGEL,"That tunes all song,"
2754,THE ANGEL,"The loves of girl and boy,"
2755,THE ANGEL,The hopes that throng
2756,THE ANGEL,"The unconquerable heart, defying wrong."
2757,THE ANGEL,Seek for thine immortality of bliss
2758,THE ANGEL,Not other brighter skies
2759,THE ANGEL,"Or later worlds than this,"
2760,THE ANGEL,"But all that in this struggle is the prize,"
2761,THE ANGEL,"The love that wings the kiss,"
2762,THE ANGEL,The truth the visions miss.
2763,THE ANGEL,
2764,THE SOUL,THE SOUL
2765,THE SOUL,
2766,THE SOUL,"My heaven lives, bright angel, in thine eyes."
2767,THE SOUL,"As when, beside the Lake of Galilee,"
2768,THE SOUL,"John, o'er his meshes bent,"
2769,THE SOUL,"Looked up, and saw another firmament"
2770,THE SOUL,"When God said, Follow me;"
2771,THE SOUL,"So is my world transfigured, seeing thee,"
2772,THE SOUL,"And, looking in thine eyes, I am content,"
2773,THE SOUL,And with thy sweet voice for all argument
2774,THE SOUL,I leave my tangled nets beside the sea.
2775,THE SOUL,"Done is my feigned task,"
2776,THE SOUL,Fallen the mask
2777,THE SOUL,"That made me other, O my soul, than thee."
2778,THE SOUL,I have fulfilled my pain
2779,THE SOUL,"And borne my cross,"
2780,THE SOUL,And my great gain
2781,THE SOUL,Is to have known my loss.
2782,THE SOUL,"Keep, blessed vision, keep"
2783,THE SOUL,The sacred beauty that entranced my soul.
2784,THE SOUL,I have read; seal the scroll.
2785,THE SOUL,I have lived; let me sleep.
2786,THE SOUL,
2787,THE ANGEL,THE ANGEL
2788,THE ANGEL,
2789,THE ANGEL,"Behold, I close thine eyes"
2790,THE ANGEL,With the first touch of my benignant hands.
2791,THE ANGEL,With consecrated brands
2792,THE ANGEL,I light thy pyre and loose thy spirit's bands.
2793,THE ANGEL,"The eternal gods receive thy sacrifice,"
2794,THE ANGEL,The changeless bless thy embers.
2795,THE ANGEL,May there arise from thence no wailing ghost
2796,THE ANGEL,That shivers and remembers
2797,THE ANGEL,"The haunts he loved, where he hath suffered most."
2798,THE ANGEL,The life that lived by change
2799,THE ANGEL,"Is dead, nor changeth more."
2800,THE ANGEL,"No eager, dull, oblivious senses pore"
2801,THE ANGEL,On portents dark and strange.
2802,THE ANGEL,"Thy first life was not life,"
2803,THE ANGEL,Nor was thy first death death.
2804,THE ANGEL,"Thy children took thy heritage of strife,"
2805,THE ANGEL,And thy transmutable breath
2806,THE ANGEL,Passed to another heart that travaileth.
2807,THE ANGEL,Now thou hast truly died;
2808,THE ANGEL,"Escaped, renounced, defied"
2809,THE ANGEL,The insensate fervour and the fret of being;
2810,THE ANGEL,"And thy own master, freed"
2811,THE ANGEL,"From shame of murderous need,"
2812,THE ANGEL,"Pure, just, all-seeing,"
2813,THE ANGEL,Now thou shalt live indeed.
2814,THE ANGEL,
2815,THE SOUL,THE SOUL
2816,THE SOUL,
2817,THE SOUL,I pay the price of birth.
2818,THE SOUL,My earth returns to earth.
2819,THE SOUL,"Hurry my ashes, thou avenging wind,"
2820,THE SOUL,Into the vortex of the whirling spheres!
2821,THE SOUL,"I die, for I have sinned,"
2822,THE SOUL,"Yea, I have loved, and drained my heart of tears."
2823,THE SOUL,"And thou within whose womb,"
2824,THE SOUL,"Mother of nations, labouring Universe,"
2825,THE SOUL,"My life grew, be its tomb."
2826,THE SOUL,"Thou brought'st me forth, take now my vital seed."
2827,THE SOUL,"Receive thy wage, thou iron-hearted nurse,"
2828,THE SOUL,Thy blessing I requite thee and thy curse.
2829,THE SOUL,Now shall my ashes breed
2830,THE SOUL,"Within thy flesh for every thought a thought,"
2831,THE SOUL,"For every deed a deed,"
2832,THE SOUL,For every pang I bore
2833,THE SOUL,"An everlasting need,"
2834,THE SOUL,"For every wrong a wrong, and endless war."
2835,THE SOUL,All earthly hopes resigned
2836,THE SOUL,And all thy battle's spoils
2837,THE SOUL,I lay upon thine altar and restore;
2838,THE SOUL,But the inviolate mind
2839,THE SOUL,Is loosened from thy toils
2840,THE SOUL,"By thy own fatal fires. I mount, I soar,"
2841,THE SOUL,"Glad Phoenix, from the flame"
2842,THE SOUL,"Into the placid heaven whence I came,"
2843,THE SOUL,Floating upon the smoke's slow lurid wings
2844,THE SOUL,Into my native sky
2845,THE SOUL,To bear report of all this vanity
2846,THE SOUL,"And sad offence of things,"
2847,THE SOUL,"Where with knowledge I may lie,"
2848,THE SOUL,Veiled in the shadow of eternal wings.
2849,THE SOUL,

2855,THE ANGEL,"Her earthly price of tears,"
2856,THE ANGEL,"Cling closer, my beloved, that the beat"
2857,THE ANGEL,Of my unruffled heart
2858,THE ANGEL,"May tune thy own, its tenderer counterpart,"
2859,THE ANGEL,"To noble courage, and from this high seat"
2860,THE ANGEL,Of our divine repose
2861,THE ANGEL,Large consolation flow to mortal woes.
2862,THE ANGEL,"For 'neath the sun's fierce heat,"
2863,THE ANGEL,"In midst of madness and inscrutable throes,"
2864,THE ANGEL,His heart is strong who knows
2865,THE ANGEL,That o'er the mountains come the silent feet
2866,THE ANGEL,"Of Patience, leading Peace,"
2867,THE ANGEL,And his complainings cease
2868,THE ANGEL,To see the starlight shining on the snows.

2959,SOUVENIR,"I weep, but with no bitterness I weep,"
2960,SOUVENIR,"To look again upon thee, hallowed spot,"
2961,SOUVENIR,"O dearest grave, and most of men forgot,"
2962,SOUVENIR,Where buried love doth sleep.
2963,SOUVENIR,
2964,SOUVENIR,"What witchcraft think you that this desert hath,"
2965,SOUVENIR,"Dear friends, who take my hand and bid me stay,"
2966,SOUVENIR,Now that the gentle wont of many a day
2967,SOUVENIR,Would lead me down this path?
2968,SOUVENIR,
2969,SOUVENIR,"Here are the wooded slopes, the flowering heath,"
2970,SOUVENIR,"The silver footprints on the silent sand,"
2971,SOUVENIR,"The loitering lanes, alive with lovers' breath,"
2972,SOUVENIR,Where first I kissed her hand.
2973,SOUVENIR,
2974,SOUVENIR,"I know these fir-trees, and this mossy stone,"
2975,SOUVENIR,"And this deep gorge, and all its winding ways;"
2976,SOUVENIR,"These friendly giants, whose primeval moan"
2977,SOUVENIR,Hath rocked my happy days.
2978,SOUVENIR,
2979,SOUVENIR,My footsteps' echo in this tangled tree
2980,SOUVENIR,"Gives back youth's music, like a singing bird;"
2981,SOUVENIR,"Dear haunts, fair wilderness her presence stirred,"
2982,SOUVENIR,Did you not watch for me?
2983,SOUVENIR,
2984,SOUVENIR,"I will not dry these tear-drops: let them flow,"
2985,SOUVENIR,"And soothe a bitterness that yet might last,"
2986,SOUVENIR,And o'er my waking-weary eyelids throw
2987,SOUVENIR,The shadow of the past.
2988,SOUVENIR,
2989,SOUVENIR,My useless plainings shall not make to cease
2990,SOUVENIR,The happy echoes of the vows we vowed:
2991,SOUVENIR,"Proud is this forest in its noble peace,"
2992,SOUVENIR,And my heart too is proud.
2993,SOUVENIR,
2994,SOUVENIR,Give o'er to hopeless grief the bitter hours
2995,SOUVENIR,You kneel to pray upon a brother's tomb:
2996,SOUVENIR,"Here blows the breath of love, and graveyard flowers"
2997,SOUVENIR,Not in this garden bloom.
2998,SOUVENIR,
2999,SOUVENIR,See! The moon rides athwart a bank of cloud.
3000,SOUVENIR,"Thy veils, fair Queen of Night, still cling to thee,"
3001,SOUVENIR,But soon thou loosenest thy virgin shroud
3002,SOUVENIR,And smilest to be free.

3004,SOUVENIR,"As the rich earth, still dank with April rain,"
3005,SOUVENIR,"Beneath thy rays exhales day's captive balm,"
3006,SOUVENIR,"So from my purged soul, as pure, as calm,"
3007,SOUVENIR,The old love breathes again.
3008,SOUVENIR,
3009,SOUVENIR,"Where are they gone, those ghosts of sorrow pale,"
3010,SOUVENIR,Where fled the passion that my heart defiled?
3011,SOUVENIR,Once in the bosom of this friendly vale
3012,SOUVENIR,I am again a child.

3014,SOUVENIR,"O  might of time, O changes of the year,"
3015,SOUVENIR,"Ye undo sorrow and the tears we shed,"

3017,SOUVENIR,Your light feet never tread.
3018,SOUVENIR,
3019,SOUVENIR,"Heavenly solace, be for ever blest!"
3020,SOUVENIR,I had not thought a sword could pierce so far
3021,SOUVENIR,"Into the heart, and leave upon the breast"
3022,SOUVENIR,So sweet and dear a scar.
3023,SOUVENIR,
3024,SOUVENIR,"Far from me the sharp word, the thankless mind,"
3025,SOUVENIR,"Of vulgar sorrow customary weed,"
3026,SOUVENIR,Shroud that about the corse of love they wind
3027,SOUVENIR,Who never loved indeed.
3028,SOUVENIR,
3029,SOUVENIR,"Why, Dante, dost thou say the saddest curse"
3030,SOUVENIR,Is joy remembered in unhappy days?
3031,SOUVENIR,What grief compelled thee to this bitter verse
3032,SOUVENIR,In sorrow's harsh dispraise?
3033,SOUVENIR,
3034,SOUVENIR,O'er all the worlds is light bereft of gladness
3035,SOUVENIR,When sad eclipses cast their blight on us?
3036,SOUVENIR,"Did thy great soul, in its immortal sadness,"
3037,SOUVENIR,"Speak to thee, Dante, thus?"
3038,SOUVENIR,
3039,SOUVENIR,"No, by this sacred light upon me cast!"
3040,SOUVENIR,Not in thy heart this blasphemy had birth.
3041,SOUVENIR,It is the truest happiness on earth
3042,SOUVENIR,To have a happy past.
3043,SOUVENIR,
3044,SOUVENIR,What! When the soul forlorn finds yet a spark
3045,SOUVENIR,"Mid the hot ashes of her stifled sighs,"
3046,SOUVENIR,"And doth that flame, her only treasure, mark"
3047,SOUVENIR,"With captivated eyes,"
3048,SOUVENIR,
3049,SOUVENIR,Bathing her wounds in the delicious past
3050,SOUVENIR,"That mirrors brokenly her loves again,"
3051,SOUVENIR,Thy cruel word her feeble joy would blast
3052,SOUVENIR,And turn to bitter pain?
3053,SOUVENIR,
3054,SOUVENIR,"And couldst thou wrong thine own Francesca so,"
3055,SOUVENIR,"Wrong thy bright angel with a word like this,"
3056,SOUVENIR,"Her whose lips, parting to rehearse her woe,"
3057,SOUVENIR,Broke an eternal kiss?
3058,SOUVENIR,
3059,SOUVENIR,"What, righteous Heaven, is our human thought,"
3060,SOUVENIR,"And to the love of truth who yet will cling,"
3061,SOUVENIR,If every pain or joy e'er shunned or sought
3062,SOUVENIR,Turns to a doubtful thing?
3063,SOUVENIR,
3064,SOUVENIR,"How can you live, strange souls that nothing awes?"
3065,SOUVENIR,"In midst of haste and passion, song and mirth,"
3066,SOUVENIR,"Nor all the stars of heaven give you pause,"
3067,SOUVENIR,Nor all the sins of earth;
3068,SOUVENIR,
3069,SOUVENIR,But when upon your fated way you meet
3070,SOUVENIR,"Some dumb memorial of a passion dead,"
3071,SOUVENIR,"That little pebble stops you, and you dread"
3072,SOUVENIR,To bruise your tender feet.
3073,SOUVENIR,
3074,SOUVENIR,"You cry aloud that life is but a dream,"
3075,SOUVENIR,"And, to the truth awaking, wring your hands,"
3076,SOUVENIR,And grieve your bubble but a moment stands
3077,SOUVENIR,Upon time's foaming stream.
3078,SOUVENIR,
3079,SOUVENIR,Poor fools! That moment when your soul could shake
3080,SOUVENIR,"The numbing fetters off that it enthrall,"
3081,SOUVENIR,That fleeting moment was your all in all--
3082,SOUVENIR,"Oh, mourn not for its sake!"
3083,SOUVENIR,
3084,SOUVENIR,"But rather mourn your weight of earthly dross,"
3085,SOUVENIR,"Your joyless toil, your stains of blood and mire,"
3086,SOUVENIR,"Your sunless days, your nights without desire;"
3087,SOUVENIR,In these was utter loss.
3088,SOUVENIR,
3089,SOUVENIR,"What profit have you of your late lament,"
3090,SOUVENIR,"And what from heaven do your murmurs crave,"
3091,SOUVENIR,The plaints you sow upon the barren grave
3092,SOUVENIR,Of every pleasure spent?
3093,SOUVENIR,
3094,SOUVENIR,"Life is a dream, and all things pass, I know:"
3095,SOUVENIR,"If some fair splendour we be charmed withal,"
3096,SOUVENIR,"We pluck the flower, and at the breath we blow"
3097,SOUVENIR,Its withered petals fall.
3098,SOUVENIR,
3099,SOUVENIR,"Ay, the first kiss and the first virgin vow"
3100,SOUVENIR,"That ever mortals upon earth did swear,"
3101,SOUVENIR,That whirlwind caught which strips the frozen bough
3102,SOUVENIR,And stones to sand doth wear.
3103,SOUVENIR,
3104,SOUVENIR,"A witness to the lovers' troth was night,"
3105,SOUVENIR,"With changeful skies, o'ercast with mystery,"
3106,SOUVENIR,"And stars unnumbered, that an inward light"
3107,SOUVENIR,Devours unceasingly.
3108,SOUVENIR,
3109,SOUVENIR,"They saw death hush the song bird in the glade,"
3110,SOUVENIR,"Blast the pale flower, and freeze the torpid worm,"
3111,SOUVENIR,And choke the fountain where the image played
3112,SOUVENIR,Of their forgotten form.
3113,SOUVENIR,
3114,SOUVENIR,"Yet they joined hands above the mouldering clod,"
3115,SOUVENIR,"Blind with love's light that flashed across the sky,"
3116,SOUVENIR,Nor felt the cold eye of the changeless God
3117,SOUVENIR,Who watches all things die.
3118,SOUVENIR,
3119,SOUVENIR,Fools! says the sage: thrice blest! the poet says.
3120,SOUVENIR,What wretched joy is to the faint heart dear
3121,SOUVENIR,Whom noise of torrents fills with weak amaze
3122,SOUVENIR,And the wind fills with fear?
3123,SOUVENIR,
3124,SOUVENIR,I have seen beneath the sun more beauties fail
3125,SOUVENIR,Than white sea foam or leaves of forest sere;
3126,SOUVENIR,More than the swallows and the roses frail
3127,SOUVENIR,Desert the widowed year.
3128,SOUVENIR,
3129,SOUVENIR,Mine eyes have gazed on sights of deeper woe
3130,SOUVENIR,"Than Juliet dead within the gorged tomb,"
3131,SOUVENIR,And deadlier than the cup that Romeo
3132,SOUVENIR,Drank to his love and doom.
3133,SOUVENIR,
3134,SOUVENIR,"I have seen my love, when all I loved had perished,"
3135,SOUVENIR,Who to a whited sepulchre is turned;
3136,SOUVENIR,Seen the thin dust of all I ever cherished
3137,SOUVENIR,"In her cold heart inurned,--"
3138,SOUVENIR,
3139,SOUVENIR,"Dust of that faith which, in our bosoms furled,"
3140,SOUVENIR,The gentle night had warded well from doubt.
3141,SOUVENIR,"More than a single life, alas! a world"
3142,SOUVENIR,Was that day blotted out.
3143,SOUVENIR,
3144,SOUVENIR,"Still young I found her, and, men said, more fair;"
3145,SOUVENIR,"In heaven's light her eyes could still rejoice,"
3146,SOUVENIR,"And her lips opened, and a smile was there,"
3147,SOUVENIR,And sound as of a voice.
3148,SOUVENIR,
3149,SOUVENIR,"But not that gentle voice, that tender grace,"
3150,SOUVENIR,Those eyes I worshipped when they looked their prayer:
3151,SOUVENIR,"My heart, still full of her, searched, searched her face"
3152,SOUVENIR,And could not find her there.
3153,SOUVENIR,
3154,SOUVENIR,"And still I could have gone to her, and cast"
3155,SOUVENIR,"My arms about that chill and lifeless stone,"

3613,THE PESSIMIST,I glowed for honesty and freedom.
3614,THE PESSIMIST,My earnest thoughts I tried to fix
3615,THE PESSIMIST,"Upon the poor, and how to feed 'em."
3616,THE PESSIMIST,"But the reformer cheats himself,"
3617,THE PESSIMIST,"He serves his prejudice or pelf,"
3618,THE PESSIMIST,And no man's will but inward fate
3619,THE PESSIMIST,Governs the fortunes of the state.
3620,THE PESSIMIST,
3621,THE PESSIMIST,"I set my heart on nothing now,"
3622,THE PESSIMIST,"But bless the gifts of every hour,"
3623,THE PESSIMIST,Holding my hand beneath life's bough
3624,THE PESSIMIST,To catch the fruit or falling flower.
3625,THE PESSIMIST,"With the world breathing at my feet,"
3626,THE PESSIMIST,"I find the sunset stillness sweet,"
3627,THE PESSIMIST,And with the night wind on my brow
3628,THE PESSIMIST,I set my heart on nothing now.
3629,THE PESSIMIST,
3630,THE PESSIMIST,"He scarce had done, when the last man,"
3631,THE PESSIMIST,"Who'd listened hard to every word,"
3632,THE PESSIMIST,"Thus, rising in his place, began"
3633,THE PESSIMIST,As if impatient to be heard:

3639,THE LOVER,"Oh, you men who are not married"
3640,THE LOVER,"Have n't known the joy of living,"
3641,THE LOVER,"On the margin you have tarried,"
3642,THE LOVER,Never putting out to sea;
3643,THE LOVER,"All your musing, all your grieving,"
3644,THE LOVER,Is a childish thing to me.
3645,THE LOVER,
3646,THE LOVER,I have done with idle moping
3647,THE LOVER,And have seen my manly duty.
3648,THE LOVER,"There is no more doubt and groping,"
3649,THE LOVER,"Since I took a woman's hand,"
3650,THE LOVER,And the loadstar of her beauty
3651,THE LOVER,Led me to the promised land.
3652,THE LOVER,
3653,THE LOVER,For her sake my work is pleasure
3654,THE LOVER,"And I thrive in my devotion,"
3655,THE LOVER,Though I seek repute and treasure
3656,THE LOVER,"But to have the gifts to give,"
3657,THE LOVER,"For my love, like River Ocean,"
3658,THE LOVER,Rounds the world in which I live.
3659,THE LOVER,
3660,THE LOVER,"When I feel, in softest slumber,"
3661,THE LOVER,"Her fair head upon my pillow,"
3662,THE LOVER,I think how the misty Humber
3663,THE LOVER,And the Ganges' holy stream
3664,THE LOVER,Send their treasures o'er the billow
3665,THE LOVER,To embalm my lady's dream.
3666,THE LOVER,
3667,THE LOVER,Rightly did my father rear me
3668,THE LOVER,"Close beside the village steeple,"
3669,THE LOVER,Rightly shall my sons revere me
3670,THE LOVER,"When they come to take my place,"
3671,THE LOVER,For I serve my land and people
3672,THE LOVER,And maintain my sturdy race.
3673,THE LOVER,
3674,THE LOVER,"Fill your glasses up with liquor,"
3675,THE LOVER,Drink it down while yet it bubbles.
3676,THE LOVER,When the heart beats quick and quicker
3677,THE LOVER,Love is knocking. Drink with me:
3678,THE LOVER,"Here is death to all your troubles,"
3679,THE LOVER,"And long life, fair love, to thee!"
3680,THE LOVER,
3681,THE LOVER,"""Yes, fill your glasses up, I pray you,"""
3682,THE LOVER,"Said I, ""and make it bumpers now,"
3683,THE LOVER,For whatsoever passion sway you
3684,THE LOVER,Some noble love we all avow.
3685,THE LOVER,
3686,THE LOVER,"""We bear a mark, an inward token,"
3687,THE LOVER,That parts us from the common herd.
3688,THE LOVER,To each of us some muse has spoken
3689,THE LOVER,"A holy, unforgotten word."
3690,THE LOVER,
3691,THE LOVER,"""Our stars, conjoined in youth's first season,"
3692,THE LOVER,Whether to musing moved or strife.
3693,THE LOVER,Obedient to one touch of reason
3694,THE LOVER,Together make the round of life.
3695,THE LOVER,
3696,THE LOVER,"""Drink to the loves we knitted here,"
3697,THE LOVER,A bond by distance not undone.
3698,THE LOVER,High thoughts outlive the wasted year;
3699,THE LOVER,"I drink to that which makes us one."""

3711,ATHLETIC ODE,To keep the morning out.
3712,ATHLETIC ODE,Beckon into the chamber of thy care
3713,ATHLETIC ODE,The bird of healing wing
3714,ATHLETIC ODE,That trilleth there
3715,ATHLETIC ODE,Blithe happy passion of the strong and fair.
3716,ATHLETIC ODE,Their wild heart singeth. Do thou also sing.
3717,ATHLETIC ODE,"How vain, how vain"
3718,ATHLETIC ODE,The feeble croaking of a reasoning tongue
3719,ATHLETIC ODE,That heals no pain
3720,ATHLETIC ODE,And prompts no bright deed worthy to be sung
3721,ATHLETIC ODE,Too soon cold earth
3722,ATHLETIC ODE,"Refuses flowers. Oh, greet their lovely birth!"
3723,ATHLETIC ODE,Too soon dull death
3724,ATHLETIC ODE,Quiets the heaving of our doubtful breath.
3725,ATHLETIC ODE,Deem not its worth
3726,ATHLETIC ODE,Too high for honouring mirth;
3727,ATHLETIC ODE,"Sing while the lyre is strung,"
3728,ATHLETIC ODE,"And let the heart beat, while the heart is young."
3729,ATHLETIC ODE,
3730,ATHLETIC ODE,When the dank earth begins to thaw and yield
3731,ATHLETIC ODE,"The early clover, didst thou never pass"
3732,ATHLETIC ODE,Some balmy noon from field to sunny field
3733,ATHLETIC ODE,And press thy feet against the tufted grass?
3734,ATHLETIC ODE,So hadst thou seen
3735,ATHLETIC ODE,A spring pal√¶stra on the tender green.
3736,ATHLETIC ODE,"Here a tall stripling, with a woman's face,"
3737,ATHLETIC ODE,"Draws the spiked sandal on his upturned heel,"
3738,ATHLETIC ODE,Sure-footed for the race;
3739,ATHLETIC ODE,Another hurls the quoit of heavy steel
3740,ATHLETIC ODE,And glories to be strong;
3741,ATHLETIC ODE,"While yet another, lightest of the throng,"
3742,ATHLETIC ODE,"Crouching on tiptoe for the sudden bound,"
3743,ATHLETIC ODE,"Flies o'er the level race-course, like the hound,"
3744,ATHLETIC ODE,And soon is lost afar;
3745,ATHLETIC ODE,"Another jumps the bar,"
3746,ATHLETIC ODE,"For some god taught him easily to spring,"
3747,ATHLETIC ODE,"The legs drawn under, as a bird takes wing,"
3748,ATHLETIC ODE,"Till, tempting fortune farther than is meet,"
3749,ATHLETIC ODE,"At last he fails, and fails, and vainly tries,"
3750,ATHLETIC ODE,"And blushing, and ashamed to lift his eyes,"
3751,ATHLETIC ODE,Shakes the light earth from his feet.
3752,ATHLETIC ODE,Him friendly plaudits greet
3753,ATHLETIC ODE,And pleasing to the unaccustomed ear.
3754,ATHLETIC ODE,"Come then afield, come with the sporting year"
3755,ATHLETIC ODE,"And watch the youth at play,"
3756,ATHLETIC ODE,"For gentle is the strengthening sun, and sweet"
3757,ATHLETIC ODE,The soul of boyhood and the breath of May.
3758,ATHLETIC ODE,
3759,ATHLETIC ODE,And with the milder ray
3760,ATHLETIC ODE,"Of the declining sun, when sky and shore,"
3761,ATHLETIC ODE,In purple drest and misty silver-grey.
3762,ATHLETIC ODE,"Hang curtains round the day,"
3763,ATHLETIC ODE,"Come list the beating of the plashing oar,"
3764,ATHLETIC ODE,For grief in rhythmic labour glides away.
3765,ATHLETIC ODE,"The glancing blades make circles where they dip,"
3766,ATHLETIC ODE,Now flash and drip
3767,ATHLETIC ODE,"Cool wind-blown drops into the glassy river,"
3768,ATHLETIC ODE,"Now sink and cleave,"
3769,ATHLETIC ODE,While the lithe rowers heave
3770,ATHLETIC ODE,And feel the boat beneath them leap and quiver.
3771,ATHLETIC ODE,"The supple oars in time,"
3772,ATHLETIC ODE,"Shattering the mirror of the rippled water,"
3773,ATHLETIC ODE,"Fly, fly as poets climb,"
3774,ATHLETIC ODE,"Borne by the pliant promise of their rhyme,"

3777,ATHLETIC ODE,Leap to the measure of her liquid song.
3778,ATHLETIC ODE,
3779,ATHLETIC ODE,"But the blasts of late October,"
3780,ATHLETIC ODE,Tempering summer's paling grief
3781,ATHLETIC ODE,"With a russet glow and sober,"
3782,ATHLETIC ODE,Bring of these sports the latest and the chief.
3783,ATHLETIC ODE,"Then bursts the flame from many a smouldering ember,"
3784,ATHLETIC ODE,And many an ardent boy
3785,ATHLETIC ODE,"Woos harsher pleasures sweeter to remember,"
3786,ATHLETIC ODE,Hugged with a sterner and a tenser joy.
3787,ATHLETIC ODE,Look where the rivals come:
3788,ATHLETIC ODE,Each little phalanx on its chosen ground
3789,ATHLETIC ODE,"Strains for the sudden shock, and all around"
3790,ATHLETIC ODE,The multitude is dumb.
3791,ATHLETIC ODE,"Come, watch the stubborn fight"
3792,ATHLETIC ODE,"And doubtful, in the sight"
3793,ATHLETIC ODE,Of wide-eyed beauty and unstinted love
3794,ATHLETIC ODE,"Ay, the wise gods above,"
3795,ATHLETIC ODE,"Attentive to this hot and generous fray,"
3796,ATHLETIC ODE,"Smile on its fortunes and its end prepare,"
3797,ATHLETIC ODE,"For play is also life, and far from care"
3798,ATHLETIC ODE,Their own glad life is play.
3799,ATHLETIC ODE,
3800,ATHLETIC ODE,"Ye nymphs and fauns, to Bacchus dear,"
3801,ATHLETIC ODE,"That woke Cith√¶ron with your midnight rout,"
3802,ATHLETIC ODE,"Arise, arise and shout!"
3803,ATHLETIC ODE,"Your day returns, your haunt is here."
3804,ATHLETIC ODE,Shake off dull sleep and long despair;
3805,ATHLETIC ODE,"There is intoxication in this air,"
3806,ATHLETIC ODE,And frenzy in this yelping cheer.
3807,ATHLETIC ODE,How oft of old the enraptured Muses sung
3808,ATHLETIC ODE,Olympian victors' praise.
3809,ATHLETIC ODE,Lo! even in these days
3810,ATHLETIC ODE,The world is young.
3811,ATHLETIC ODE,Life like a torrent flung
3812,ATHLETIC ODE,For ever down
3813,ATHLETIC ODE,For ever wears a rainbow for a crown.
3814,ATHLETIC ODE,"O idle sigh for loveliness outworn,"
3815,ATHLETIC ODE,When the red flush of each unfailing morn
3816,ATHLETIC ODE,"Floods every field and grove,"
3817,ATHLETIC ODE,And no moon wanes but some one is in love.
3818,ATHLETIC ODE,"O wasted tear,"
3819,ATHLETIC ODE,A new soul wakes with each awakened year.
3820,ATHLETIC ODE,"Beneath these rags, these blood-clots on the face,"
3821,ATHLETIC ODE,"The valiant soul is still the same, the same"
3822,ATHLETIC ODE,"The strength, the art, the inevitable grace,"
3823,ATHLETIC ODE,The thirst unquenched for fame
3824,ATHLETIC ODE,"Quenching base passion, the high will severe,"
3825,ATHLETIC ODE,"The long obedience, and the knightly flame"
3826,ATHLETIC ODE,Of loyalty to honour and a name.
3827,ATHLETIC ODE,
3828,ATHLETIC ODE,"Give o'er, ye chords, your music ere ye tire,"
3829,ATHLETIC ODE,"Be sweetly mute, O lyre."
3830,ATHLETIC ODE,"Words soon are cold, and life is warm for ever."
3831,ATHLETIC ODE,"One half of honour is the strong endeavour,"

3961,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Called Mrs. Fakir--necromantic name!
3962,THE POETIC MEDIUM,"Past, present, future, open to her view"
3963,THE POETIC MEDIUM,She (for ten dollars) will reveal to you.
3964,THE POETIC MEDIUM,I for less sums--the discount to the trade--
3965,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Quaff at her fount and seek her undismayed.
3966,THE POETIC MEDIUM,I found the priestess in her wonted lair
3967,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Up three steep flights of narrow dirty stair.
3968,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Chill was the darkened chamber. A thick fume
3969,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Of kerosene lent odour to the gloom.
3970,THE POETIC MEDIUM,"Clothed in black weeds, pale, with delirious hair,"
3971,THE POETIC MEDIUM,Rocked Mrs. Fakir in her rocking-chair.

3973,THE POETIC MEDIUM,"About the fee, she fell into a faint,"
3974,THE POETIC MEDIUM,"Thrice rolled her eyes, thrice snorted through her nose,"
3975,THE POETIC MEDIUM,"Thrice wrung her hands, and wriggled thrice her toes,"

4314,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4315,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4316,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"When scarce the echoes of Manila Bay,"
4317,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Circling each slumbering billowy hemisphere,"
4318,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Had met where Spain's forlorn Armada lay
4319,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Locked amid hostile hills, and whispered near"
4320,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The double omen of that groan and cheer--Haste
4321,SPAIN IN AMERICA,to do now what must be done anon
4322,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Or some mad hope of selling triumph dear
4323,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Drove the ships forth: soon was _Teresa_ gone,"
4324,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"_Fur√≥r, Pluton, Vizcaya, Oquendo_, and _Col√≥n_."
4325,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4326,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And when the second morning dawned serene
4327,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"O'er vivid waves and foam-fringed mountains, dressed"
4328,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Like Nessus in their robe's envenomed sheen,"
4329,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Scarce by some fiery fleck the place was guessed
4330,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Where each hulk smouldered; while from crest to crest
4331,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Leapt through the North the news of victory,"
4332,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Victory tarnished by a boorish jest
4333,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Yet touched with pity, lest the unkindly sea"
4334,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should too much aid the strong and leave no enemy.
4335,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4336,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"As the anguished soul, that gasped for difficult breath,"
4337,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Passes to silence from its house of pain,"
4338,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"So from those wrecks, in fumes of lurid death,"
4339,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Passed into peace the heavy pride of Spain,"
4340,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Passed from that aching tenement, half fain,"
4341,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Back to her castled hills and windy moors,"
4342,SPAIN IN AMERICA,No longer tossed upon the treacherous main
4343,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Once boasted hers, which with its watery lures"
4344,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Too long enticed her sons to unhallowed sepultures.
4345,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4346,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Why went Columbus to that highland race,"
4347,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Frugal and pensive, prone to love and ire,"
4348,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Despising kingdoms for a woman's face,"
4349,SPAIN IN AMERICA,For honour riches and for faith desire?
4350,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"On Spain's own breast was snow, within it fire;"
4351,SPAIN IN AMERICA,In her own eyes and subtle tongue was mirth;
4352,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The eternal brooded in her skies, whence nigher"
4353,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The trebled starry host admonished earth
4354,SPAIN IN AMERICA,To shame away her grief and mock her baubles' worth.
4355,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4356,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Ah! when the crafty Tyrian came to Spain
4357,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"To barter for her gold his motley wares,"
4358,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Treading her beaches he forgot his gain.
4359,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The Semite became noble unawares.
4360,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Her passion breathed Hamilcar's cruel prayers;
4361,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Her fiery winds taught Hannibal his vows;
4362,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Out of her tribulations and despairs
4363,SPAIN IN AMERICA,They wove a sterile garland for their brows.
4364,SPAIN IN AMERICA,To her sad ports they fled before the Roman prows.
4365,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4366,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And the Greek coming too forgot his art,"
4367,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And that large temperance which made him wise.
4368,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The wonder of her mountains choked his heart,"
4369,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The languor of her gardens veiled his eyes;
4370,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"He dreamed, he doubted; in her deeper skies"
4371,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"He read unfathomed oracles of woe,"
4372,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And stubborn to the onward destinies,"
4373,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Like some dumb brute before a human foe,"
4374,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Sank in Saguntum's flames and deemed them brighter so.
4375,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4376,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The mighty Roman also when he came,"
4377,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Bringing his gods, his justice, and his tongue,"
4378,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Put off his greatness for a sadder fame,"
4379,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And what a C√¶sar wrought a Lucan sung.
4380,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Nor was the pomp of his proud music, wrung"
4381,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"From Latin numbers, half so stern and dire,"
4382,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Nor the sad majesties he moved among
4383,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Half so divine, as her unbreathed desire."
4384,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Shall longing break the heart and not untune the lyre?
4385,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4386,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"When after many conquerors came Christ,"
4387,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The only conqueror of Spain indeed,"
4388,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Not Bethlehem nor Golgotha sufficed
4389,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"To show him forth, but every shrine must bleed"
4390,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And every shepherd in his watches heed
4391,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The angels' matins sung at heaven's gate.
4392,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Nor seemed the Virgin Mother wholly freed
4393,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"From taint of ill if born in frail estate,"
4394,SPAIN IN AMERICA,But shone the seraphs' queen and soared immaculate.
4395,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4396,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And when the Arab from his burning sands
4397,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Swept o'er the waters like a heavenly flail,"
4398,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"He took her lute into his conquering hands,"
4399,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And in her midnight turned to nightingale.
4400,SPAIN IN AMERICA,With woven lattices and pillars frail
4401,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"He screened the pleasant secrets of his bower,"
4402,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Yet little could his subtler arts avail
4403,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Against the brutal onset of the Giaour.
4404,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The rose passed from his courts, the muezzin from his tower."
4405,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4406,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Only one image of his wisdom stayed,"
4407,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"One only relic of his magic lore,--"
4408,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Allah the Great, whom silent fate obeyed,"
4409,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"More than Jehovah calm and hidden more,"
4410,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Allah remained in her heart's kindred core
4411,SPAIN IN AMERICA,High witness of these terrene shifts of wrong.
4412,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Into his ancient silence she could pour
4413,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Her passions' frailty--He alone is strong--
4414,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And chant with lingering wail the burden of her song.
4415,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4416,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Seizing at Covadonga the rude cross
4417,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Pelayo raised amid his mountaineers,"
4418,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"She bore it to Granada, one day's loss"
4419,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Ransomed with battles of a thousand years.
4420,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"A nation born in harness, fed on tears,"
4421,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Christened in blood, and schooled in sacrifice,"
4422,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"All for a sweeter music in the spheres,"
4423,SPAIN IN AMERICA,All for a painted heaven--at a price
4424,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should she forsake her loves and sail to Ind for spice?
4425,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4426,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Had Genoa in her merchant palaces
4427,SPAIN IN AMERICA,No welcome for a heaven-guided son?
4428,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Had Venice, mistress of the inland seas,"
4429,SPAIN IN AMERICA,No ships for bolder venture? Pisa none?
4430,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Was sated Rome content? Her mission done?
4431,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Saw Lusitania in her seaward dreams
4432,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"No floating premonition, beckoning on"
4433,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"To vast horizons, gilded yet with gleams"
4434,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Of old Atlantis, whelmed beneath the bubbling streams?"
4435,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4436,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Or if some torpor lay upon the South,"
4437,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Tranced by the might of memories divine,"
4438,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Dwelt no shrewd princeling by the marshy mouth
4439,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Of Scheldt, or by the many mouths of Rhine?"
4440,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Rode Albion not at anchor in the brine
4441,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Whose throne but now the thrifty Tudor stole
4442,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Changing a noble for a crafty line?
4443,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Swarmed not the Norsemen yet about the pole,"
4444,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Seeking through endless mists new havens for the soul?
4445,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4446,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"These should have been thy mates, Columbus, these"
4447,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Patrons and partners of thy enterprise,"
4448,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Sad lovers of immeasurable seas,"
4449,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Bound to no hallowed earth, no peopled skies."
4450,SPAIN IN AMERICA,No ray should reach them of their ladies' eyes
4451,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"In western deserts: no pure minstrel's rhyme,"
4452,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Echoing in forest solitudes, surprise"
4453,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Their heart with longing for a sweeter clime.
4454,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"These, these should found a world who drag no chains of time."
4455,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4456,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"In sooth it had seemed folly, to reveal"
4457,SPAIN IN AMERICA,To stubborn Aragon and evil-eyed
4458,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"These perilous hopes, folly to dull Castile"
4459,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Moated in jealous faith and walled in pride,"
4460,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Save that those thoughts, to Spain's fresh deeds allied,"
4461,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Painted new Christian conquests, and her hand"
4462,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Itched for that sword, now dangling at her side,"
4463,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Which drove the Moslem forth and purged the land.
4464,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And then she dreamed a dream her heart could understand.
4465,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4466,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Three caravels, a cross upon the prow,"
4467,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"A broad cross on the banner and the sail,"
4468,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The liquid fields of Hesperus should plough
4469,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Borne by the leaping waters and the gale.
4470,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Before that sign all hellish powers should quail
4471,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Troubling the deep: no dragon's obscene crest,"
4472,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"No serpent's slimy coils should aught avail,"
4473,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Till ivory cities looming in the west
4474,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Should gleam from high Cathay or Araby the Blest,"
4475,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4476,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Then, as with noble mien and debonair"
4477,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The captains from the galleys leapt to land,"
4478,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Or down the temple's alabaster stair
4479,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Or by the river's marge of silvery sand,"
4480,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Proud Sultans should descend with outstretched hand
4481,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Greeting the strangers, and by them apprised"
4482,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Of Christ's redemption and the Queen's command,"
4483,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Being with joy and gratitude baptised,"
4484,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should lavish gifts of price by rarest art devised.
4485,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4486,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Or if (since churls there be) they should demur
4487,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"To some least point of fealty or faith,"
4488,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"A champion, clad in arms from crest to spur,"
4489,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should challenge the proud caitiffs to their death
4490,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And, singly felling them, from their last breath"
4491,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Extort confession that the Lord is lord,"
4492,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And India's Catholic queen, Elizabeth."
4493,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Whereat yon turbaned tribes, with one accord,"
4494,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should beat their heathen breasts and ope their treasures' horde.
4495,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4496,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Or, if the worst should chance and high debates"
4497,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Should end in insult and outrageous deed,"
4498,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And, many Christians rudely slain, their mates"
4499,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Should summon heaven to their direful need,"
4500,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Suddenly from the clouds a snow-white steed
4501,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Bearing a dazzling rider clad in flames
4502,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should plunge into the fray: with instant speed
4503,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Rout all the foe at once, while mid acclaims"
4504,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The slaughtered braves should rise, crying, _Saint James! Saint James!_"
4505,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4506,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Then, the day won, and its bright arbiter"
4507,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Vanished, save for peace he left behind,"
4508,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Each in his private bosom should bestir
4509,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Plis dearest dream: as that perchance there pined
4510,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Some lovely maiden of angelic mind
4511,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"In those dark towers, awaiting out of Spain"
4512,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Two Saviours that her horoscope divined
4513,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Should thence arrive. She (womanlike) were fain
4514,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Not to be wholly free, but wear a chosen chain."
4515,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4516,SPAIN IN AMERICA,That should be youth's adventure. Riper days
4517,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Would crave the guerdon of a prouder power
4518,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And pluck their nuggets from an earthly maze
4519,SPAIN IN AMERICA,For rule and dignity and children's dower.
4520,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And age that thought to near the fatal hour
4521,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Should to a magic fount descend instead,"
4522,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Whose waters with the fruit revive the flower
4523,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And deck in all its bloom the ashen head,"
4524,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Where a green heaven spreads, not peopled of the dead."
4525,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4526,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"By such false meteors did those helmsmen steer,"
4527,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Such phantoms filled their vain and vaulting souls
4528,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"With divers ardours, while this brooding sphere"
4529,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Swung yet ungirdled on her silent poles.
4530,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"All journeys took them farther from their goals,"
4531,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"All battles won defeated their desire,"
4532,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Barred from one India by the other's shoals,"
4533,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Each sighted star extinguishing its fire,"
4534,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Cape doubled after cape, and never haven nigher."
4535,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4536,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"How many galleons sailed to sail no more,"
4537,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"How many battles and how many slain,"
4538,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Since first Columbus touched the Cuban shore,"
4539,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Till Aurocania felt the yoke of Spain!
4540,SPAIN IN AMERICA,What mounting miseries! What dwindling gain!
4541,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"To till those solitudes, soon swept of gold,"
4542,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"And bear that ardent sun, across the main"
4543,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Slaves must come writhing in the festering hold
4544,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Of galleys.--Poison works, though men be brave and bold."
4545,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4546,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"That slothful planter, once the buccaneer,"
4547,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Lord of his bastards and his mongrel clan,"
4548,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Ignorant, harsh, what could he list or hear"
4549,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Of Europe and the heritage of man?
4550,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"No petty schemer sees the larger plan,"
4551,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"No privy tyrant brooks the mightier law,"
4552,SPAIN IN AMERICA,But lash in hand rides forth a partisan
4553,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Of freedom: base, without the touch of awe,"
4554,SPAIN IN AMERICA,He poisoned first the blood his poniard was to draw.
4555,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4556,SPAIN IN AMERICA,By sloth and lust and mindlessness and pelf
4557,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Spain sank in sadness and dishonour down,"
4558,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Each in her service serving but himself,"
4559,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Each in his passion striking at her crown.
4560,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Not that these treasons blotted her renown
4561,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Emblazoned higher than such hands can reach:
4562,SPAIN IN AMERICA,There where she reaped but sorrow she has sown
4563,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The balm of sorrow; all she had to teach
4564,SPAIN IN AMERICA,She taught the younger world--her faith and heart and speech.
4565,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4566,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And now within her sea-girt walls withdrawn
4567,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"She waits in silence for the healing years,"
4568,SPAIN IN AMERICA,While where her sun has set a second dawn
4569,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Comes from the north, with other hopes and fears."
4570,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Spain's daughters stand, half ceasing from their tears,"
4571,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And watch the skies from Cuba to the Horn.
4572,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"""What is this dove or eagle that appears,"""
4573,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"They seem to cry, ""what herald of what morn"
4574,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Hovers o'er Andes' peaks in love or guile or scorn?"""

4580,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Dread waveless waters and their warm delight,"
4581,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Beware of peaks that cleave the cloudless blue
4582,SPAIN IN AMERICA,And hold communion with the naked night.
4583,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"The souls went never back that hither flew,"
4584,SPAIN IN AMERICA,But sighing fell to earth or broke the heavens through.
4585,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4586,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"""Haunt still thy storm-swept islands, and endure"
4587,SPAIN IN AMERICA,The shimmering forest where thy visions live.
4588,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Then if we love thee--for thy heart is pure--Thou
4589,SPAIN IN AMERICA,shalt have something worthy love to give.
4590,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Thrust not thy prophets on us, nor believe"
4591,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Thy sorry riches in our eyes are fair.
4592,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Thy unctuous sophists never will deceive
4593,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"A mortal pang, or charm away despair."
4594,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Not for the stranger's fee we plait our lustrous hair.
4595,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4596,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"""But of thy lingering twilight bring some gleam,"
4597,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Memorial of the immaterial fire
4598,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Lighting thy heart, and to a wider dream"
4599,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Waken the music of our plaintive lyre.
4600,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Check our rash word, hush, hush our base desire."
4601,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Hang paler clouds of reverence about
4602,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Our garish skies: laborious hope inspire
4603,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"That uncomplaining walks the paths of doubt,"
4604,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"A wistful heart within, a mailed breast without."
4605,SPAIN IN AMERICA,
4606,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"""Gold found is dross, but long Promethean art"
4607,SPAIN IN AMERICA,Transmutes to gold the unprofitable ore.
4608,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Bring labour's joy, yet spare that better part"
4609,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Our mother, Spain, bequeathed to all she bore,"
4610,SPAIN IN AMERICA,For who shall covet if he once adore?
4611,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"Leave in our skies, strange Spirit passing there,"
4612,SPAIN IN AMERICA,"No less of vision but of courage more,"
