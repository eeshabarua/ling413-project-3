45,,"I have remembered beauty in the night,"
46,,Against black silences I waked to see
47,,A shower of sunlight over Italy
48,,And green Ravello dreaming on her height;
49,,"I have remembered music in the dark,"
50,,"The clean swift brightness of a fugue of Bach's,"
51,,And running water singing on the rocks
52,,When once in English woods I heard a lark.
53,,
54,,But all remembered beauty is no more
55,,Than a vague prelude to the thought of you--
56,,"You are the rarest soul I ever knew,"
57,,"Lover of beauty, knightliest and best;"
58,,"My thoughts seek you as waves that seek the shore,"
59,,"And when I think of you, I am at rest."

178,I,
179,I,Barter
180,I,
181,I,
182,I,"Life has loveliness to sell,"
183,I,"All beautiful and splendid things,"
184,I,"Blue waves whitened on a cliff,"
185,I,"Soaring fire that sways and sings,"
186,I,And children's faces looking up
187,I,Holding wonder like a cup.
188,I,
189,I,"Life has loveliness to sell,"
190,I,"Music like a curve of gold,"
191,I,"Scent of pine trees in the rain,"
192,I,"Eyes that love you, arms that hold,"
193,I,"And for your spirit's still delight,"
194,I,Holy thoughts that star the night.
195,I,
196,I,"Spend all you have for loveliness,"
197,I,Buy it and never count the cost;
198,I,For one white singing hour of peace
199,I,"Count many a year of strife well lost,"
200,I,And for a breath of ecstasy
201,I,"Give all you have been, or could be."
202,I,
203,I,
204,I,
205,I,
206,I,Twilight
207,I,
208,I,
209,I,Dreamily over the roofs
210,I,The cold spring rain is falling;
211,I,Out in the lonely tree
212,I,"A bird is calling, calling."
213,I,
214,I,Slowly over the earth
215,I,The wings of night are falling;
216,I,My heart like the bird in the tree
217,I,"Is calling, calling, calling."
218,I,
219,I,
220,I,
221,I,
222,I,Night Song at Amalfi
223,I,
224,I,
225,I,I asked the heaven of stars
226,I,What I should give my love--
227,I,"It answered me with silence,"
228,I,Silence above.
229,I,
230,I,I asked the darkened sea
231,I,Down where the fishers go--
232,I,"It answered me with silence,"
233,I,Silence below.
234,I,
235,I,"Oh, I could give him weeping,"
236,I,Or I could give him song--
237,I,"But how can I give silence,"
238,I,My whole life long?
239,I,
240,I,
241,I,
242,I,
243,I,The Look
244,I,
245,I,
246,I,"Strephon kissed me in the spring,"
247,I,"Robin in the fall,"
248,I,But Colin only looked at me
249,I,And never kissed at all.
250,I,
251,I,"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,"
252,I,"Robin's lost in play,"
253,I,But the kiss in Colin's eyes
254,I,Haunts me night and day.
255,I,
256,I,
257,I,
258,I,
259,I,A Winter Night
260,I,
261,I,
262,I,"My window-pane is starred with frost,"
263,I,"The world is bitter cold to-night,"
264,I,"The moon is cruel, and the wind"
265,I,Is like a two-edged sword to smite.
266,I,
267,I,"God pity all the homeless ones,"
268,I,"The beggars pacing to and fro,"
269,I,God pity all the poor to-night
270,I,Who walk the lamp-lit streets of snow.
271,I,
272,I,"My room is like a bit of June,"
273,I,"Warm and close-curtained fold on fold,"
274,I,"But somewhere, like a homeless child,"
275,I,My heart is crying in the cold.
276,I,
277,I,
278,I,
279,I,
280,I,A Cry
281,I,
282,I,
283,I,"Oh, there are eyes that he can see,"
284,I,"And hands to make his hands rejoice,"
285,I,But to my lover I must be
286,I,Only a voice.
287,I,
288,I,"Oh, there are breasts to bear his head,"
289,I,"And lips whereon his lips can lie,"
290,I,But I must be till I am dead
291,I,Only a cry.
292,I,
293,I,
294,I,
295,I,
296,I,Gifts
297,I,
298,I,
299,I,"I gave my first love laughter,"
300,I,"I gave my second tears,"
301,I,I gave my third love silence
302,I,Through all the years.
303,I,
304,I,"My first love gave me singing,"
305,I,"My second eyes to see,"
306,I,"But oh, it was my third love"
307,I,Who gave my soul to me.
308,I,
309,I,
310,I,
311,I,
312,I,But Not to Me
313,I,
314,I,
315,I,The April night is still and sweet
316,I,With flowers on every tree;
317,I,"Peace comes to them on quiet feet,"
318,I,But not to me.
319,I,
320,I,My peace is hidden in his breast
321,I,Where I shall never be;
322,I,"Love comes to-night to all the rest,"
323,I,But not to me.
324,I,
325,I,
326,I,
327,I,
328,I,Song at Capri
329,I,
330,I,
331,I,When beauty grows too great to bear
332,I,"How shall I ease me of its ache,"
333,I,For beauty more than bitterness
334,I,Makes the heart break.
335,I,
336,I,Now while I watch the dreaming sea
337,I,"With isles like flowers against her breast,"
338,I,Only one voice in all the world
339,I,Could give me rest.
340,I,
341,I,
342,I,
343,I,
344,I,"Child, Child"
345,I,
346,I,
347,I,"Child, child, love while you can"
348,I,The voice and the eyes and the soul of a man;
349,I,Never fear though it break your heart--
350,I,Out of the wound new joy will start;
351,I,"Only love proudly and gladly and well,"
352,I,Though love be heaven or love be hell.
353,I,
354,I,"Child, child, love while you may,"
355,I,For life is short as a happy day;
356,I,Never fear the thing you feel--
357,I,Only by love is life made real;
358,I,"Love, for the deadly sins are seven,"
359,I,Only through love will you enter heaven.
360,I,
361,I,
362,I,
363,I,
364,I,Love Me
365,I,
366,I,
367,I,Brown-thrush singing all day long
368,I,"In the leaves above me,"
369,I,"Take my love this April song,"
370,I,"""Love me, love me, love me!"""
371,I,
372,I,"When he harkens what you say,"
373,I,"Bid him, lest he miss me,"
374,I,"Leave his work or leave his play,"
375,I,"And kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!"
376,I,
377,I,
378,I,
379,I,
380,I,Pierrot
381,I,
382,I,
383,I,Pierrot stands in the garden
384,I,"Beneath a waning moon,"
385,I,And on his lute he fashions
386,I,A fragile silver tune.
387,I,
388,I,"Pierrot plays in the garden,"
389,I,"He thinks he plays for me,"
390,I,But I am quite forgotten
391,I,Under the cherry tree.
392,I,
393,I,"Pierrot plays in the garden,"
394,I,And all the roses know
395,I,"That Pierrot loves his music,--"
396,I,But I love Pierrot.
397,I,
398,I,
399,I,
400,I,
401,I,Wild Asters
402,I,
403,I,
404,I,In the spring I asked the daisies
405,I,"If his words were true,"
406,I,"And the clever, clear-eyed daisies"
407,I,Always knew.
408,I,
409,I,"Now the fields are brown and barren,"
410,I,"Bitter autumn blows,"
411,I,And of all the stupid asters
412,I,Not one knows.
413,I,
414,I,
415,I,
416,I,
417,I,The Song for Colin
418,I,
419,I,
420,I,I sang a song at dusking time
421,I,"Beneath the evening star,"
422,I,And Terence left his latest rhyme
423,I,To answer from afar.
424,I,
425,I,"Pierrot laid down his lute to weep,"
426,I,"And sighed, ""She sings for me."""
427,I,But Colin slept a careless sleep
428,I,Beneath an apple tree.
429,I,
430,I,
431,I,
432,I,
433,I,Four Winds
434,I,
435,I,
436,I,"""Four winds blowing through the sky,"
437,I,"You have seen poor maidens die,"
438,I,Tell me then what I shall do
439,I,"That my lover may be true."""
440,I,"Said the wind from out the south,"
441,I,"""Lay no kiss upon his mouth,"""
442,I,"And the wind from out the west,"
443,I,"""Wound the heart within his breast,"""
444,I,"And the wind from out the east,"
445,I,"""Send him empty from the feast,"""
446,I,"And the wind from out the north,"
447,I,"""In the tempest thrust him forth;"
448,I,"When thou art more cruel than he,"
449,I,"Then will Love be kind to thee."""
450,I,
451,I,
452,I,
453,I,
454,I,Debt
455,I,
456,I,
457,I,What do I owe to you
458,I,Who loved me deep and long?
459,I,You never gave my spirit wings
460,I,Or gave my heart a song.
461,I,
462,I,"But oh, to him I loved,"
463,I,"Who loved me not at all,"
464,I,I owe the open gate
465,I,That led through heaven's wall.
466,I,
467,I,
468,I,
469,I,
470,I,Faults
471,I,
472,I,
473,I,"They came to tell your faults to me,"
474,I,They named them over one by one;
475,I,"I laughed aloud when they were done,"
476,I,"I knew them all so well before,--"
477,I,"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see"
478,I,Your faults had made me love you more.
479,I,
480,I,
481,I,
482,I,
483,I,Buried Love
484,I,
485,I,
486,I,I have come to bury Love
487,I,"Beneath a tree,"
488,I,In the forest tall and black
489,I,Where none can see.
490,I,
491,I,"I shall put no flowers at his head,"
492,I,"Nor stone at his feet,"
493,I,For the mouth I loved so much
494,I,Was bittersweet.
495,I,
496,I,"I shall go no more to his grave,"
497,I,For the woods are cold.
498,I,I shall gather as much of joy
499,I,As my hands can hold.
500,I,
501,I,I shall stay all day in the sun
502,I,"Where the wide winds blow,--"
503,I,"But oh, I shall cry at night"
504,I,When none will know.
505,I,
506,I,
507,I,
508,I,
509,I,The Fountain
510,I,
511,I,
512,I,All through the deep blue night
513,I,The fountain sang alone;
514,I,It sang to the drowsy heart
515,I,Of the satyr carved in stone.
516,I,
517,I,"The fountain sang and sang,"
518,I,But the satyr never stirred--
519,I,Only the great white moon
520,I,In the empty heaven heard.
521,I,
522,I,The fountain sang and sang
523,I,While on the marble rim
524,I,"The milk-white peacocks slept,"
525,I,And their dreams were strange and dim.
526,I,
527,I,"Bright dew was on the grass,"
528,I,"And on the ilex, dew,"
529,I,The dreamy milk-white birds
530,I,"Were all a-glisten, too."
531,I,
532,I,The fountain sang and sang
533,I,The things one cannot tell;
534,I,The dreaming peacocks stirred
535,I,And the gleaming dew-drops fell.
536,I,
537,I,
538,I,
539,I,
540,I,I Shall Not Care
541,I,
542,I,
543,I,When I am dead and over me bright April
544,I,"Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,"
545,I,"Though you should lean above me broken-hearted,"
546,I,I shall not care.
547,I,
548,I,"I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful"
549,I,"When rain bends down the bough,"
550,I,And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
551,I,Than you are now.
552,I,
553,I,
554,I,
555,I,
556,I,After Parting
557,I,
558,I,
559,I,"Oh, I have sown my love so wide"
560,I,That he will find it everywhere;
561,I,"It will awake him in the night,"
562,I,It will enfold him in the air.
563,I,
564,I,I set my shadow in his sight
565,I,"And I have winged it with desire,"
566,I,"That it may be a cloud by day,"
567,I,And in the night a shaft of fire.
568,I,
569,I,
570,I,
571,I,
572,I,A Prayer
573,I,
574,I,
575,I,Until I lose my soul and lie
576,I,"Blind to the beauty of the earth,"
577,I,"Deaf though shouting wind goes by,"
578,I,Dumb in a storm of mirth;
579,I,
580,I,Until my heart is quenched at length
581,I,"And I have left the land of men,"
582,I,"Oh, let me love with all my strength"
583,I,Careless if I am loved again.
584,I,
585,I,
586,I,
587,I,
588,I,Spring Night
589,I,
590,I,
591,I,"The park is filled with night and fog,"
592,I,"The veils are drawn about the world,"
593,I,The drowsy lights along the paths
594,I,Are dim and pearled.
595,I,
596,I,"Gold and gleaming the empty streets,"
597,I,"Gold and gleaming the misty lake,"
598,I,"The mirrored lights like sunken swords,"
599,I,Glimmer and shake.
600,I,
601,I,"Oh, is it not enough to be"
602,I,Here with this beauty over me?
603,I,"My throat should ache with praise, and I"
604,I,Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
605,I,"O, beauty, are you not enough?"
606,I,"Why am I crying after love,"
607,I,"With youth, a singing voice, and eyes"
608,I,To take earth's wonder with surprise?
609,I,
610,I,"Why have I put off my pride,"
611,I,"Why am I unsatisfied,--"
612,I,"I, for whom the pensive night"
613,I,"Binds her cloudy hair with light,--"
614,I,"I, for whom all beauty burns"
615,I,Like incense in a million urns?
616,I,"O beauty, are you not enough?"
617,I,Why am I crying after love?
618,I,
619,I,
620,I,
621,I,
622,I,May Wind
623,I,
624,I,
625,I,"I said, ""I have shut my heart"
626,I,"As one shuts an open door,"
627,I,That Love may starve therein
628,I,"And trouble me no more."""
629,I,
630,I,But over the roofs there came
631,I,"The wet new wind of May,"
632,I,And a tune blew up from the curb
633,I,Where the street-pianos play.
634,I,
635,I,My room was white with the sun
636,I,"And Love cried out in me,"
637,I,"""I am strong, I will break your heart"
638,I,"Unless you set me free."""
639,I,
640,I,
641,I,
642,I,
643,I,Tides
644,I,
645,I,
646,I,Love in my heart was a fresh tide flowing
647,I,Where the starlike sea gulls soar;
648,I,The sun was keen and the foam was blowing
649,I,High on the rocky shore.
650,I,
651,I,"But now in the dusk the tide is turning,"
652,I,"Lower the sea gulls soar,"
653,I,And the waves that rose in resistless yearning
654,I,Are broken forevermore.
655,I,
656,I,
657,I,
658,I,
659,I,After Love
660,I,
661,I,
662,I,"There is no magic any more,"
663,I,"We meet as other people do,"
664,I,You work no miracle for me
665,I,Nor I for you.
666,I,
667,I,You were the wind and I the sea--
668,I,"There is no splendor any more,"
669,I,I have grown listless as the pool
670,I,Beside the shore.
671,I,
672,I,But though the pool is safe from storm
673,I,"And from the tide has found surcease,"
674,I,"It grows more bitter than the sea,"
675,I,For all its peace.
676,I,
677,I,
678,I,
679,I,
680,I,New Love and Old
681,I,
682,I,
683,I,In my heart the old love
684,I,Struggled with the new;
685,I,It was ghostly waking
686,I,All night through.
687,I,
688,I,"Dear things, kind things,"
689,I,"That my old love said,"
690,I,Ranged themselves reproachfully
691,I,Round my bed.
692,I,
693,I,"But I could not heed them,"
694,I,For I seemed to see
695,I,The eyes of my new love
696,I,Fixed on me.
697,I,
698,I,"Old love, old love,"
699,I,How can I be true?
700,I,Shall I be faithless to myself
701,I,Or to you?
702,I,
703,I,
704,I,
705,I,
706,I,The Kiss
707,I,
708,I,
709,I,"I hoped that he would love me,"
710,I,"And he has kissed my mouth,"
711,I,But I am like a stricken bird
712,I,That cannot reach the south.
713,I,
714,I,"For though I know he loves me,"
715,I,To-night my heart is sad;
716,I,His kiss was not so wonderful
717,I,As all the dreams I had.
718,I,
719,I,
720,I,
721,I,
722,I,Swans
723,I,
724,I,
725,I,"Night is over the park, and a few brave stars"
726,I,"Look on the lights that link it with chains of gold,"
727,I,The lake bears up their reflection in broken bars
728,I,That seem too heavy for tremulous water to hold.
729,I,
730,I,"We watch the swans that sleep in a shadowy place,"
731,I,And now and again one wakes and uplifts its head;
732,I,How still you are--your gaze is on my face--
733,I,We watch the swans and never a word is said.
734,I,
735,I,
736,I,
737,I,
738,I,The River
739,I,
740,I,
741,I,I came from the sunny valleys
742,I,"And sought for the open sea,"
743,I,For I thought in its gray expanses
744,I,My peace would come to me.
745,I,
746,I,I came at last to the ocean
747,I,"And found it wild and black,"
748,I,"And I cried to the windless valleys,"
749,I,"""Be kind and take me back!"""
750,I,
751,I,"But the thirsty tide ran inland,"
752,I,"And the salt waves drank of me,"
753,I,And I who was fresh as the rainfall
754,I,Am bitter as the sea.
755,I,
756,I,
757,I,
758,I,
759,I,November
760,I,
761,I,
762,I,"The world is tired, the year is old,"
763,I,"The fading leaves are glad to die,"
764,I,The wind goes shivering with cold
765,I,Where the brown reeds are dry.
766,I,
767,I,"Our love is dying like the grass,"
768,I,"And we who kissed grow coldly kind,"
769,I,Half glad to see our old love pass
770,I,Like leaves along the wind.
771,I,
772,I,
773,I,
774,I,
775,I,Spring Rain
776,I,
777,I,
778,I,"I thought I had forgotten,"
779,I,But it all came back again
780,I,To-night with the first spring thunder
781,I,In a rush of rain.
782,I,
783,I,I remembered a darkened doorway
784,I,"Where we stood while the storm swept by,"
785,I,Thunder gripping the earth
786,I,And lightning scrawled on the sky.
787,I,
788,I,"The passing motor busses swayed,"
789,I,"For the street was a river of rain,"
790,I,Lashed into little golden waves
791,I,In the lamp light's stain.
792,I,
793,I,With the wild spring rain and thunder
794,I,My heart was wild and gay;
795,I,Your eyes said more to me that night
796,I,Than your lips would ever say. . . .
797,I,
798,I,"I thought I had forgotten,"
799,I,But it all came back again
800,I,To-night with the first spring thunder
801,I,In a rush of rain.
802,I,
803,I,
804,I,
805,I,
806,I,The Ghost
807,I,
808,I,
809,I,"I went back to the clanging city,"
810,I,"I went back where my old loves stayed,"
811,I,"But my heart was full of my new love's glory,"
812,I,My eyes were laughing and unafraid.
813,I,
814,I,I met one who had loved me madly
815,I,And told his love for all to hear--
816,I,"But we talked of a thousand things together,"
817,I,The past was buried too deep to fear.
818,I,
819,I,"I met the other, whose love was given"
820,I,With never a kiss and scarcely a word--
821,I,"Oh, it was then the terror took me"
822,I,Of words unuttered that breathed and stirred.
823,I,
824,I,"Oh, love that lives its life with laughter"
825,I,Or love that lives its life with tears
826,I,Can die--but love that is never spoken
827,I,Goes like a ghost through the winding years. . . .
828,I,
829,I,"I went back to the clanging city,"
830,I,"I went back where my old loves stayed,"
831,I,"My heart was full of my new love's glory,--"
832,I,But my eyes were suddenly afraid.
833,I,
834,I,
835,I,
836,I,
837,I,"Summer Night, Riverside"
838,I,
839,I,
840,I,"In the wild, soft summer darkness"
841,I,How many and many a night we two together
842,I,Sat in the park and watched the Hudson
843,I,Wearing her lights like golden spangles
844,I,Glinting on black satin.
845,I,The rail along the curving pathway
846,I,"Was low in a happy place to let us cross,"
847,I,And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom
848,I,"Sheltered us,"
849,I,"While your kisses and the flowers,"
850,I,"Falling, falling,"
851,I,Tangled my hair. . . .
852,I,
853,I,
854,I,The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky.
855,I,
856,I,
857,I,"And now, far off"
858,I,In the fragrant darkness
859,I,"The tree is tremulous again with bloom,"
860,I,For June comes back.
861,I,
862,I,To-night what girl
863,I,Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair
864,I,"This year's blossoms, clinging in its coils?"
865,I,
866,I,
867,I,
868,I,
869,I,Jewels
870,I,
871,I,
872,I,"If I should see your eyes again,"
873,I,I know how far their look would go--
874,I,Back to a morning in the park
875,I,With sapphire shadows on the snow.
876,I,
877,I,Or back to oak trees in the spring
878,I,When you unloosed my hair and kissed
879,I,The head that lay against your knees
880,I,In the leaf shadow's amethyst.
881,I,
882,I,And still another shining place
883,I,We would remember--how the dun
884,I,Wild mountain held us on its crest
885,I,One diamond morning white with sun.
886,I,
887,I,But I will turn my eyes from you
888,I,As women turn to put away
889,I,The jewels they have worn at night
890,I,And cannot wear in sober day.

899,II,
900,II,
901,II,I.  Spirit's House
902,II,
903,II,
904,II,From naked stones of agony
905,II,I will build a house for me;
906,II,As a mason all alone
907,II,"I will raise it, stone by stone,"
908,II,And every stone where I have bled
909,II,Will show a sign of dusky red.
910,II,"I have not gone the way in vain,"
911,II,For I have good of all my pain;
912,II,My spirit's quiet house will be
913,II,Built of naked stones I trod
914,II,On roads where I lost sight of God.
915,II,
916,II,
917,II,
918,II,
919,II,II.  Mastery
920,II,
921,II,
922,II,I would not have a god come in
923,II,"To shield me suddenly from sin,"
924,II,And set my house of life to rights;
925,II,Nor angels with bright burning wings
926,II,Ordering my earthly thoughts and things;
927,II,Rather my own frail guttering lights
928,II,Wind blown and nearly beaten out;
929,II,Rather the terror of the nights
930,II,"And long, sick groping after doubt;"
931,II,Rather be lost than let my soul
932,II,Slip vaguely from my own control--
933,II,Of my own spirit let me be
934,II,In sole though feeble mastery.
935,II,
936,II,
937,II,
938,II,
939,II,III.  Lessons
940,II,
941,II,
942,II,Unless I learn to ask no help
943,II,"From any other soul but mine,"
944,II,To seek no strength in waving reeds
945,II,Nor shade beneath a straggling pine;
946,II,Unless I learn to look at Grief
947,II,"Unshrinking from her tear-blind eyes,"
948,II,And take from Pleasure fearlessly
949,II,Whatever gifts will make me wise--
950,II,"Unless I learn these things on earth,"
951,II,Why was I ever given birth?
952,II,
953,II,
954,II,
955,II,
956,II,IV.  Wisdom
957,II,
958,II,
959,II,When I have ceased to break my wings
960,II,"Against the faultiness of things,"
961,II,And learned that compromises wait
962,II,"Behind each hardly opened gate,"
963,II,"When I can look Life in the eyes,"
964,II,"Grown calm and very coldly wise,"
965,II,"Life will have given me the Truth,"
966,II,And taken in exchange--my youth.
967,II,
968,II,
969,II,
970,II,
971,II,V.  In a Burying Ground
972,II,
973,II,
974,II,This is the spot where I will lie
975,II,"When life has had enough of me,"
976,II,These are the grasses that will blow
977,II,Above me like a living sea.
978,II,
979,II,These gay old lilies will not shrink
980,II,"To draw their life from death of mine,"
981,II,And I will give my body's fire
982,II,To make blue flowers on this vine.
983,II,
984,II,"""O Soul,"" I said, ""have you no tears?"
985,II,"Was not the body dear to you?"""
986,II,"I heard my soul say carelessly,"
987,II,"""The myrtle flowers will grow more blue."""

992,II,VI.  Wood Song
993,II,
994,II,
995,II,I heard a wood thrush in the dusk
996,II,Twirl three notes and make a star--
997,II,My heart that walked with bitterness
998,II,Came back from very far.
999,II,
1000,II,"Three shining notes were all he had,"
1001,II,And yet they made a starry call--
1002,II,I caught life back against my breast
1003,II,"And kissed it, scars and all."
1004,II,
1005,II,
1006,II,
1007,II,
1008,II,VII.  Refuge
1009,II,
1010,II,
1011,II,"From my spirit's gray defeat,"
1012,II,"From my pulse's flagging beat,"
1013,II,From my hopes that turned to sand
1014,II,"Sifting through my close-clenched hand,"
1015,II,"From my own fault's slavery,"
1016,II,"If I can sing, I still am free."
1017,II,
1018,II,For with my singing I can make
1019,II,"A refuge for my spirit's sake,"
1020,II,"A house of shining words, to be"
1021,II,My fragile immortality.

1030,III,The Flight
1031,III,
1032,III,
1033,III,"Look back with longing eyes and know that I will follow,"
1034,III,"Lift me up in your love as a light wind lifts a swallow,"
1035,III,Let our flight be far in sun or blowing rain--
1036,III,_But what if I heard my first love calling me again?_
1037,III,
1038,III,"Hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam,"
1039,III,Take me far away to the hills that hide your home;
1040,III,Peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door--
1041,III,_But what if I heard my first love calling me once more?_
1042,III,
1043,III,
1044,III,
1045,III,
1046,III,Dew
1047,III,
1048,III,
1049,III,As dew leaves the cobweb lightly
1050,III,"Threaded with stars,"
1051,III,Scattering jewels on the fence
1052,III,And the pasture bars;
1053,III,As dawn leaves the dry grass bright
1054,III,And the tangled weeds
1055,III,Bearing a rainbow gem
1056,III,On each of their seeds;
1057,III,"So has your love, my lover,"
1058,III,"Fresh as the dawn,"
1059,III,Made me a shining road
1060,III,"To travel on,"
1061,III,Set every common sight
1062,III,Of tree or stone
1063,III,Delicately alight
1064,III,For me alone.
1065,III,
1066,III,
1067,III,
1068,III,
1069,III,To-night
1070,III,
1071,III,
1072,III,"The moon is a curving flower of gold,"
1073,III,The sky is still and blue;
1074,III,"The moon was made for the sky to hold,"
1075,III,And I for you.
1076,III,
1077,III,"The moon is a flower without a stem,"
1078,III,The sky is luminous;
1079,III,"Eternity was made for them,"
1080,III,To-night for us.
1081,III,
1082,III,
1083,III,
1084,III,
1085,III,Ebb Tide
1086,III,
1087,III,
1088,III,When the long day goes by
1089,III,"And I do not see your face,"
1090,III,"The old wild, restless sorrow"
1091,III,Steals from its hiding place.
1092,III,
1093,III,"My day is barren and broken,"
1094,III,"Bereft of light and song,"
1095,III,A sea beach bleak and windy
1096,III,That moans the whole day long.
1097,III,
1098,III,"To the empty beach at ebb tide,"
1099,III,"Bare with its rocks and scars,"
1100,III,"Come back like the sea with singing,"
1101,III,And light of a million stars.
1102,III,
1103,III,
1104,III,
1105,III,
1106,III,I Would Live in Your Love
1107,III,
1108,III,
1109,III,"I would live in your love as the sea-grasses live in the sea,"
1110,III,"Borne up by each wave as it passes, drawn down by each wave that recedes;"
1111,III,"I would empty my soul of the dreams that have gathered in me,"
1112,III,"I would beat with your heart as it beats, I would follow your soul"
1113,III,as it leads.
1114,III,
1115,III,
1116,III,
1117,III,
1118,III,Because
1119,III,
1120,III,
1121,III,"Oh, because you never tried"
1122,III,"To bow my will or break my pride,"
1123,III,And nothing of the cave-man made
1124,III,"You want to keep me half afraid,"
1125,III,Nor ever with a conquering air
1126,III,You thought to draw me unaware--
1127,III,"Take me, for I love you more"
1128,III,Than I ever loved before.
1129,III,
1130,III,And since the body's maidenhood
1131,III,Alone were neither rare nor good
1132,III,Unless with it I gave to you
1133,III,"A spirit still untrammeled, too,"
1134,III,Take my dreams and take my mind
1135,III,That were masterless as wind;
1136,III,"And ""Master!"" I shall say to you"
1137,III,Since you never asked me to.
1138,III,
1139,III,
1140,III,
1141,III,
1142,III,The Tree of Song
1143,III,
1144,III,
1145,III,"I sang my songs for the rest,"
1146,III,For you I am still;
1147,III,The tree of my song is bare
1148,III,On its shining hill.
1149,III,
1150,III,"For you came like a lordly wind,"
1151,III,And the leaves were whirled
1152,III,Far as forgotten things
1153,III,Past the rim of the world.
1154,III,
1155,III,The tree of my song stands bare
1156,III,Against the blue--
1157,III,"I gave my songs to the rest,"
1158,III,Myself to you.
1159,III,
1160,III,

1163,III,The Giver
1164,III,
1165,III,
1166,III,"You bound strong sandals on my feet,"
1167,III,"You gave me bread and wine,"
1168,III,"And sent me under sun and stars,"
1169,III,For all the world was mine.
1170,III,
1171,III,"Oh, take the sandals off my feet,"
1172,III,You know not what you do;
1173,III,"For all my world is in your arms,"
1174,III,My sun and stars are you.

1179,III,April Song
1180,III,
1181,III,
1182,III,"Willow, in your April gown"
1183,III,"Delicate and gleaming,"
1184,III,Do you mind in years gone by
1185,III,All my dreaming?
1186,III,
1187,III,Spring was like a call to me
1188,III,"That I could not answer,"
1189,III,"I was chained to loneliness,"
1190,III,"I, the dancer."
1191,III,
1192,III,"Willow, twinkling in the sun,"
1193,III,"Still your leaves and hear me,"
1194,III,"I can answer spring at last,"
1195,III,Love is near me!

1199,III,
1200,III,The Wanderer
1201,III,
1202,III,
1203,III,"I saw the sunset-colored sands,"
1204,III,"The Nile like flowing fire between,"
1205,III,"Where Rameses stares forth serene,"
1206,III,And Ammon's heavy temple stands.
1207,III,
1208,III,"I saw the rocks where long ago,"
1209,III,"Above the sea that cries and breaks,"
1210,III,Swift Perseus with Medusa's snakes
1211,III,Set free the maiden white like snow.
1212,III,
1213,III,"And many skies have covered me,"
1214,III,"And many winds have blown me forth,"
1215,III,"And I have loved the green, bright north,"
1216,III,"And I have loved the cold, sweet sea."
1217,III,
1218,III,"But what to me are north and south,"
1219,III,"And what the lure of many lands,"
1220,III,Since you have leaned to catch my hands
1221,III,And lay a kiss upon my mouth.
1222,III,

1224,III,
1225,III,
1226,III,The Years
1227,III,
1228,III,
1229,III,To-night I close my eyes and see
1230,III,A strange procession passing me--
1231,III,The years before I saw your face
1232,III,Go by me with a wistful grace;
1233,III,"They pass, the sensitive, shy years,"
1234,III,"As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears."
1235,III,
1236,III,The years went by and never knew
1237,III,That each one brought me nearer you;
1238,III,Their path was narrow and apart
1239,III,And yet it led me to your heart--
1240,III,"Oh, sensitive, shy years, oh, lonely years,"
1241,III,That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears.
1242,III,
1243,III,
1244,III,
1245,III,
1246,III,Enough
1247,III,
1248,III,
1249,III,It is enough for me by day
1250,III,To walk the same bright earth with him;
1251,III,Enough that over us by night
1252,III,The same great roof of stars is dim.
1253,III,
1254,III,I do not hope to bind the wind
1255,III,Or set a fetter on the sea--
1256,III,It is enough to feel his love
1257,III,Blow by like music over me.
1258,III,
1259,III,
1260,III,
1261,III,
1262,III,Come
1263,III,
1264,III,
1265,III,"Come, when the pale moon like a petal"
1266,III,"Floats in the pearly dusk of spring,"
1267,III,"Come with arms outstretched to take me,"
1268,III,Come with lips pursed up to cling.
1269,III,
1270,III,"Come, for life is a frail moth flying,"
1271,III,"Caught in the web of the years that pass,"
1272,III,"And soon we two, so warm and eager,"
1273,III,Will be as the gray stones in the grass.

1283,III,"I love, I am loved, he is mine,"
1284,III,Now at last I can die!
1285,III,
1286,III,"I am sandaled with wind and with flame,"
1287,III,"I have heart-fire and singing to give,"
1288,III,"I can tread on the grass or the stars,"

1298,III,Yet these are wealth enough for me;
1299,III,My thoughts of you are golden coins
1300,III,Stamped in the mint of memory;
1301,III,
1302,III,"And I must spend them all in song,"
1303,III,"For thoughts, as well as gold, must be"
1304,III,Left on the hither side of death
1305,III,To gain their immortality.

1314,III,To gather me close in the old sweet way--
1315,III,"But oh, to the woman over the sea"
1316,III,Who will come at the close of day?
1317,III,
1318,III,A half-hour more and I will hear
1319,III,"The key in the latch and the strong, quick tread--"
1320,III,"But oh, the woman over the sea"
1321,III,Waiting at dusk for one who is dead!

1330,III,As the tide to the pool by the shore;
1331,III,"It is mine forevermore,"
1332,III,It will not ebb like the sea.
1333,III,
1334,III,I am the pool of blue
1335,III,That worships the vivid sky;
1336,III,"My hopes were heaven-high,"
1337,III,They are all fulfilled in you.
1338,III,
1339,III,I am the pool of gold
1340,III,When sunset burns and dies--
1341,III,You are my deepening skies;
1342,III,Give me your stars to hold.

1353,III,"Oh, be for me the earth!"
1354,III,
1355,III,I am the brown bird pining

1367,III,And filled them every one
1368,III,"With tenderness and nobleness,"
1369,III,April and the sun.
1370,III,
1371,III,The old empty dreams
1372,III,Where my thoughts would throng
1373,III,Are far too full of happiness
1374,III,To even hold a song.
1375,III,
1376,III,"Oh, the empty dreams were dim"
1377,III,"And the empty dreams were wide,"
1378,III,They were sweet and shadowy houses
1379,III,Where my thoughts could hide.
1380,III,
1381,III,But you took my dreams away
1382,III,And you made them all come true--
1383,III,"My thoughts have no place now to play,"
1384,III,And nothing now to do.

1394,III,"Safe in our own love and the gentle gloom,"
1395,III,"Glad of familiar wall and chair and floor,"
1396,III,
1397,III,Glad to leave far below the clanging city;
1398,III,Looking far downward to the glaring street
1399,III,"Gaudy with light, yet tired with many feet,"
1400,III,In both of us wells up a wordless pity;
1401,III,
1402,III,Men have tried hard to put away the dark;
1403,III,A million lighted windows brilliantly
1404,III,"Inlay with squares of gold the winter night,"
1405,III,But to us standing here there comes the stark
1406,III,"Sense of the lives behind each yellow light,"

1417,III,"Lost as a candle lit at noon,"
1418,III,Lost as a snowflake in the sea.
1419,III,
1420,III,"You love me, and I find you still"
1421,III,"A spirit beautiful and bright,"
1422,III,"Yet I am I, who long to be"
1423,III,Lost as a light is lost in light.
1424,III,
1425,III,Oh plunge me deep in love--put out
1426,III,"My senses, leave me deaf and blind,"
1427,III,"Swept by the tempest of your love,"
1428,III,A taper in a rushing wind.

1437,III,And you have both the house and her--
1438,III,But sometimes she is less your own
1439,III,"Than a wild, gay adventurer;"
1440,III,"A restless and an eager wraith,"
1441,III,How can I tell what she will do--
1442,III,"Oh, I am sure of my body's faith,"
1443,III,But what if my soul broke faith with you?

1453,III,Is there no peace for me on earth
1454,III,Except with you?
1455,III,
1456,III,"Alas, the wind has made me wise,"

1464,III,Morning
1465,III,
1466,III,
1467,III,I went out on an April morning
1468,III,"All alone, for my heart was high,"
1469,III,"I was a child of the shining meadow,"
1470,III,I was a sister of the sky.
1471,III,
1472,III,There in the windy flood of morning
1473,III,"Longing lifted its weight from me,"
1474,III,"Lost as a sob in the midst of cheering,"
1475,III,Swept as a sea-bird out to sea.

1481,III,
1482,III,
1483,III,When I talk with other men
1484,III,I always think of you--
1485,III,"Your words are keener than their words,"
1486,III,"And they are gentler, too."
1487,III,
1488,III,"When I look at other men,"
1489,III,"I wish your face were there,"
1490,III,With its gray eyes and dark skin
1491,III,And tossed black hair.
1492,III,
1493,III,"When I think of other men,"
1494,III,"Dreaming alone by day,"
1495,III,The thought of you like a strong wind
1496,III,Blows the dreams away.

1508,III,
1509,III,"I said, ""It is no great sorrow"
1510,III,"That quenched my youth in me,"
1511,III,But only little sorrows
1512,III,"Beating ceaselessly."""
1513,III,
1514,III,"I thought my youth was gone,"
1515,III,But you returned--
1516,III,Like a flame at the call of the wind
1517,III,It leaped and burned;
1518,III,
1519,III,"Threw off its ashen cloak,"
1520,III,And gowned anew
1521,III,Gave itself like a bride

1563,IV,A November Night
1564,IV,
1565,IV,
1566,IV,"There!  See the line of lights,"
1567,IV,A chain of stars down either side the street--
1568,IV,"Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,"
1569,IV,A necklace for my throat?  I'd twist it round
1570,IV,And you could play with it.  You smile at me
1571,IV,As though I were a little dreamy child
1572,IV,"Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . .  And see,"
1573,IV,The people on the street look up at us
1574,IV,"All envious.  We are a king and queen,"
1575,IV,"Our royal carriage is a motor bus,"
1576,IV,We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
1577,IV,How still you are!  Have you been hard at work
1578,IV,And are you tired to-night?  It is so long
1579,IV,"Since I have seen you--four whole days, I think."
1580,IV,My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
1581,IV,"Like early flowers in an April meadow,"
1582,IV,"And I must give them to you, all of them,"
1583,IV,"Before they fade.  The people I have met,"
1584,IV,"The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things"
1585,IV,"That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows"
1586,IV,"That hurry, gesturing along a wall,"
1587,IV,Haunting or gay--and yet they all grow real
1588,IV,And take their proper size here in my heart
1589,IV,"When you have seen them. . . .  There's the Plaza now,"
1590,IV,A lake of light!  To-night it almost seems
1591,IV,"That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,"
1592,IV,Drawn somehow toward you.  See the open park
1593,IV,Lying below us with a million lamps
1594,IV,Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
1595,IV,We look down on them as God must look down
1596,IV,On constellations floating under Him
1597,IV,"Tangled in clouds. . . .  Come, then, and let us walk"
1598,IV,"Since we have reached the park.  It is our garden,"
1599,IV,"All black and blossomless this winter night,"
1600,IV,"But we bring April with us, you and I;"
1601,IV,We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
1602,IV,I think that every path we ever took
1603,IV,"Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,"
1604,IV,Delicate gold that only fairies see.
1605,IV,When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
1606,IV,"And come out on the drowsy park, they look"
1607,IV,"Along the empty paths and say, ""Oh, here"
1608,IV,"They went, and here, and here, and here!  Come, see,"
1609,IV,"Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance"
1610,IV,About it in a windy ring and make
1611,IV,A circle round it only they can cross
1612,IV,"When they come back again!"" . . .  Look at the lake--"
1613,IV,Do you remember how we watched the swans
1614,IV,That night in late October while they slept?
1615,IV,"Swans must have stately dreams, I think.  But now"
1616,IV,The lake bears only thin reflected lights
1617,IV,That shake a little.  How I long to take
1618,IV,One from the cold black water--new-made gold
1619,IV,"To give you in your hand!  And see, and see,"
1620,IV,"There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!"
1621,IV,"Oh, dimmer than a pearl--if you stoop down"
1622,IV,Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .
1623,IV,
1624,IV,There was a new frail yellow moon to-night--
1625,IV,I wish you could have had it for a cup
1626,IV,With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .
1627,IV,
1628,IV,How cold it is!  Even the lights are cold;
1629,IV,"They have put shawls of fog around them, see!"
1630,IV,What if the air should grow so dimly white
1631,IV,That we would lose our way along the paths
1632,IV,Made new by walls of moving mist receding
1633,IV,The more we follow. . . .  What a silver night!
1634,IV,That was our bench the time you said to me
1635,IV,"The long new poem--but how different now,"
1636,IV,How eerie with the curtain of the fog
1637,IV,Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
1638,IV,"There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls"
1639,IV,"Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist."
1640,IV,"Walk on a little, let me stand here watching"
1641,IV,"To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . ."
1642,IV,I used to wonder how the park would be
1643,IV,If one night we could have it all alone--
1644,IV,No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
1645,IV,To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
1646,IV,And now we have it!  Every wish comes true!
1647,IV,We are alone now in a fleecy world;
1648,IV,Even the stars have gone.  We two alone!
