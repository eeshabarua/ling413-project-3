38,TO ABBIE.,"NOTE.--The lines in this little book, as in all my others, were"
39,TO ABBIE.,"written, or at least conceived, in the lands where the scenes are"
40,TO ABBIE.,"laid; so that whatever may be said of the imperfections of my work,"
41,TO ABBIE.,I at least have the correct atmosphere and color. I have now and
42,TO ABBIE.,"then sent forth from Mexico, and from remoter shores of the Gulf,"
43,TO ABBIE.,"fragments of these thoughts as they rounded into form, and some"
44,TO ABBIE.,"of them have been used at a Dartmouth College Commencement, and"
45,TO ABBIE.,elsewhere; but as a whole the book is new.
46,TO ABBIE.,
47,TO ABBIE.,"From the heart of the Sierra, where I once more hear the awful"
48,TO ABBIE.,"heart-throbs of Nature, I now intrust the first reception of these"
49,TO ABBIE.,"lessons entirely to my own country. And may I not ask in return,"
50,TO ABBIE.,"now at the last, when the shadows begin to grow long, something"
51,TO ABBIE.,"of that consideration which, thus far, has been accorded almost"
52,TO ABBIE.,entirely by strangers?

68,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
69,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
70,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"In that far land, farther than Yucatan,"
71,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Hondurian height, or Mahogany steep,"
72,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Where the great sea, hollowed by the hand of man"
73,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Hears deep come calling across to deep;
74,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Where the great seas follow in the grooves of men
75,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Down under the bastions of Darien:
76,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
77,THE SEA OF FIRE.,In that land so far that you wonder whether
78,THE SEA OF FIRE.,If God would know it should you fall down dead;
79,THE SEA OF FIRE.,In that land so far through the wilds and weather
80,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"That the lost sun sinks like a warrior sped,--"
81,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Where the sea and the sky seem closing together,"
82,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Seem closing together as a book that is read:
83,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
84,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"In that nude warm world, where the unnamed rivers"
85,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Roll restless in cradles of bright buried gold;
86,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Where white flashing mountains flow rivers of silver
87,THE SEA OF FIRE.,As a rock of the desert flowed fountains of old;
88,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"By a dark wooded river that calls to the dawn,"
89,THE SEA OF FIRE.,And calls all day with his dolorous swan:
90,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
91,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"In that land of the wonderful sun and weather,"
92,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"With green under foot and with gold over head,"
93,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Where the spent sun flames, and you wonder whether"
94,THE SEA OF FIRE.,'Tis an isle of fire in his foamy bed:
95,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Where the oceans of earth shall be welded together
96,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"By the great French master in his forge flame red,--"
97,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
98,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Lo! the half-finished world! Yon footfall retreating,--"
99,THE SEA OF FIRE.,It might be the Maker disturbed at his task.
100,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"But the footfall of God, or the far pheasant beating,"
101,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"It is one and the same, whatever the mask"
102,THE SEA OF FIRE.,It may wear unto man. The woods keep repeating
103,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The old sacred sermons, whatever you ask."
104,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
105,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The brown-muzzled cattle come stealthy to drink,"
106,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The wild forest cattle, with high horns as trim"
107,THE SEA OF FIRE.,As the elk at their side: their sleek necks are slim
108,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"And alert like the deer. They come, then they shrink"
109,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"As afraid of their fellows, of shadow-beasts seen"
110,THE SEA OF FIRE.,In the deeps of the dark-wooded waters of green.
111,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
112,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"It is man in his garden, scarce wakened as yet"
113,THE SEA OF FIRE.,From the sleep that fell on him when woman was made.
114,THE SEA OF FIRE.,The new-finished garden is plastic and wet
115,THE SEA OF FIRE.,From the hand that has fashioned its unpeopled shade;
116,THE SEA OF FIRE.,And the wonder still looks from the fair woman's eyes
117,THE SEA OF FIRE.,As she shines through the wood like the light from the skies.
118,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
119,THE SEA OF FIRE.,And a ship now and then from some far Ophir's shore
120,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Draws in from the sea. It lies close to the bank;
121,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"Then a dull, muffled sound of the slow-shuffled plank"
122,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"As they load the black ship; but you hear nothing more,"
123,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"And the dark dewy vines, and the tall sombre wood"
124,THE SEA OF FIRE.,Like twilight droop over the deep sweeping flood.
125,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
126,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The black masts are tangled with branches that cross,"
127,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The rich, fragrant gums fall from branches to deck,"
128,THE SEA OF FIRE.,The thin ropes are swinging with streamers of moss
129,THE SEA OF FIRE.,That mantle all things like the shreds of a wreck;
130,THE SEA OF FIRE.,"The long mosses swing, there is never a breath:"
131,THE SEA OF FIRE.,The river rolls still as the river of death.
132,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
133,THE SEA OF FIRE.,
134,I.,I.
135,I.,
136,I.,"In the beginning,--ay, before"
137,I.,The six-days' labors were well o'er;
138,I.,"Yea, while the world lay incomplete,"
139,I.,Ere God had opened quite the door
140,I.,"Of this strange land for strong men's feet,--"
141,I.,There lay against that westmost sea
142,I.,One weird-wild land of mystery.
143,I.,
144,I.,"A far white wall, like fallen moon,"
145,I.,Girt out the world. The forest lay
146,I.,"So deep you scarcely saw the day,"
147,I.,Save in the high-held middle noon:
148,I.,"It lay a land of sleep and dreams,"
149,I.,And clouds drew through like shoreless streams
150,I.,That stretch to where no man may say.
151,I.,
152,I.,"Men reached it only from the sea,"
153,I.,"By black-built ships, that seemed to creep"
154,I.,"Along the shore suspiciously,"
155,I.,Like unnamed monsters of the deep.
156,I.,"It was the weirdest land, I ween,"
157,I.,That mortal eye has ever seen:
158,I.,
159,I.,"A dim, dark land of bird and beast,"
160,I.,"Black shaggy beasts with cloven claw,--"
161,I.,"A land that scarce knew prayer or priest,"
162,I.,"Or law of man, or Nature's law;"
163,I.,Where no fixed line drew sharp dispute
164,I.,'Twixt savage man and silent brute.
165,I.,
166,I.,
167,II.,II.
168,II.,
169,II.,It hath a history most fit
170,II.,For cunning hand to fashion on;
171,II.,No chronicler hath mentioned it;
172,II.,No buccaneer set foot upon.
173,II.,"'Tis of an outlawed Spanish Don,--"
174,II.,"A cruel man, with pirate's gold"
175,II.,That loaded down his deep ship's hold.
176,II.,
177,II.,A deep ship's hold of plundered gold!
178,II.,"The golden cruise, the golden cross,"
179,II.,"From many a church of Mexico,"
180,II.,"From Panama's mad overthrow,"
181,II.,"From many a ransomed city's loss,"
182,II.,"From many a follower stanch and bold,"
183,II.,And many a foeman stark and cold.
184,II.,
185,II.,"He found this wild, lost land. He drew"
186,II.,"His ship to shore. His ruthless crew,"
187,II.,"Like Romulus, laid lawless hand"
188,II.,"On meek brown maidens of the land,"
189,II.,And in their bloody forays bore
190,II.,Red firebrands along the shore.
191,II.,
192,II.,
193,III.,III.
194,III.,
195,III.,"The red men rose at night. They came,"
196,III.,"A firm, unflinching wall of flame;"
197,III.,"They swept, as sweeps some fateful sea"
198,III.,O'er land of sand and level shore
199,III.,"That howls in far, fierce agony."
200,III.,"The red men swept that deep, dark shore"
201,III.,As threshers sweep a threshing-floor.
202,III.,
203,III.,And yet beside the slain Don's door
204,III.,"They left his daughter, as they fled:"
205,III.,"They spared her life, because she bore"
206,III.,Their Chieftain's blood and name. The red
207,III.,And blood-stained hidden hoards of gold
208,III.,"They hollowed from the stout ship's hold,"
209,III.,And bore in many a slim canoe--
210,III.,To where? The good priest only knew.
211,III.,
212,III.,
213,IV.,IV.
214,IV.,
215,IV.,The course of life is like the sea:
216,IV.,Men come and go; tides rise and fall;
217,IV.,And that is all of history.
218,IV.,"The tide flows in, flows out to-day,--"
219,IV.,And that is all that man may say;
220,IV.,"Man is, man was,--and that is all."
221,IV.,
222,IV.,"Revenge at last came like a tide,--"
223,IV.,"'Twas sweeping, deep, and terrible;"
224,IV.,"The Christian found the land, and came"
225,IV.,To take possession in Christ's name.
226,IV.,For every white man that had died
227,IV.,"I think a thousand red men fell,--"
228,IV.,A Christian custom; and the land
229,IV.,Lay lifeless as some burned-out brand.
230,IV.,
231,IV.,
232,V.,V.
233,V.,
234,V.,Ere while the slain Don's daughter grew
235,V.,"A glorious thing, a flower of spring,"
236,V.,"A lithe slim reed, a sun-loved weed,"
237,V.,A something more than mortal knew;
238,V.,"A mystery of grace and face,--"
239,V.,A silent mystery that stood
240,V.,"An empress in that sea-set wood,"
241,V.,"Supreme, imperial in her place."
242,V.,
243,V.,"It might have been men's lust for gold,--"
244,V.,For all men knew that lawless crew
245,V.,"Left hoards of gold in that ship's hold,"
246,V.,"That drew ships hence, and silent drew"
247,V.,"Strange Jasons to that steep wood shore,"
248,V.,"As if to seek that hidden store,--"
249,V.,I never either cared or knew.
250,V.,
251,V.,I say it might have been this gold
252,V.,That ever drew and strangely drew
253,V.,"Strong men of land, strange men of sea,"
254,V.,To seek this shore of mystery
255,V.,With all its wondrous tales untold:
256,V.,"The gold or her, which of the two?"
257,V.,It matters not; I never knew.
258,V.,
259,V.,"But this I know, that as for me,"
260,V.,Between that face and the hard fate
261,V.,"That kept me ever from my own,"
262,V.,"As some wronged monarch from his throne,"
263,V.,God's heaped-up gold of land or sea
264,V.,Had never weighed one feather's weight.
265,V.,
266,V.,"Her home was on the wooded height,--"
267,V.,"A woody home, a priest at prayer,"
268,V.,"A perfume in the fervid air,"
269,V.,And angels watching her at night.
270,V.,I can but think upon the skies
271,V.,That bound that other Paradise.
272,V.,
273,V.,
274,VI.,VI.
275,VI.,
276,VI.,"Below a star-built arch, as grand"
277,VI.,As ever bended heaven spanned;
278,VI.,Tall trees like mighty columns grew--
279,VI.,"They loomed as if to pierce the blue,"
280,VI.,They reached as reaching heaven through.
281,VI.,
282,VI.,"The shadowed stream rolled far below,"
283,VI.,Where men moved noiseless to and fro
284,VI.,"As in some vast cathedral, when"
285,VI.,"The calm of prayer comes to men,"
286,VI.,"With benedictions, bending low."
287,VI.,
288,VI.,"Lo! wooded sea-banks, wild and steep!"
289,VI.,A trackless wood; a snowy cone
290,VI.,That lifted from this wood alone!
291,VI.,"This wild wide river, dark and deep!"
292,VI.,A ship against the shore asleep!
293,VI.,
294,VI.,
295,VII.,VII.
296,VII.,
297,VII.,"An Indian woman crept, a crone,"
298,VII.,"Hard by about the land alone,"
299,VII.,The relic of her perished race.
300,VII.,"She wore rich, rudely-fashioned bands"
301,VII.,Of gold above her bony hands:
302,VII.,She hissed hot curses on the place!
303,VII.,
304,VII.,
305,VIII.,VIII.
306,VIII.,
307,VIII.,Go seek the red man's last retreat!
308,VIII.,"A lonesome land, the haunted lands!"
309,VIII.,"Red mouths of beasts, red men's red hands:"
310,VIII.,"Red prophet-priest, in mute defeat!"
311,VIII.,
312,VIII.,His boundaries in blood are writ!
313,VIII.,"His land is ghostland! That is his,"
314,VIII.,Whatever man may claim of this;
315,VIII.,Beware how you shall enter it!
316,VIII.,He stands God's guardian of ghostlands;
317,VIII.,"Ay, this same wrapped half-prophet stands"
318,VIII.,"All nude and voiceless, nearer to"
319,VIII.,The awful God than I or you.
320,VIII.,
321,VIII.,
322,IX.,IX.
323,IX.,
324,IX.,"This bronzed child, by that river's brink,"
325,IX.,"Stood fair to see as you can think,"
326,IX.,"As tall as tall reeds at her feet,"
327,IX.,As fresh as flowers in her hair;
328,IX.,"As sweet as flowers over-sweet,"
329,IX.,As fair as vision more than fair!
330,IX.,
331,IX.,How beautiful she was! How wild!
332,IX.,"How pure as water-plant, this child,--"
333,IX.,This one wild child of Nature here
334,IX.,Grown tall in shadows.
335,IX.,And how near
336,IX.,"To God, where no man stood between"
337,IX.,"Her eyes and scenes no man hath seen,--"
338,IX.,"This maiden that so mutely stood,"
339,IX.,The one lone woman of that wood.
340,IX.,
341,IX.,"Stop still, my friend, and do not stir,"
342,IX.,Shut close your page and think of her.
343,IX.,The birds sang sweeter for her face;
344,IX.,Her lifted eyes were like a grace
345,IX.,"To seamen of that solitude,"
346,IX.,"However rough, however rude."
347,IX.,
348,IX.,"The rippled rivers of her hair,"
349,IX.,"That ran in wondrous waves, somehow"
350,IX.,"Flowed down divided by her brow,--"
351,IX.,"Half mantled her within its care,"
352,IX.,"And flooded all, or bronze or snow,"
353,IX.,In its uncommon fold and flow.
354,IX.,
355,IX.,A perfume and an incense lay
356,IX.,"Before her, as an incense sweet"
357,IX.,Before blithe mowers of sweet May
358,IX.,In early morn. Her certain feet
359,IX.,Embarked on no uncertain way.
360,IX.,
361,IX.,"Come, think how perfect before men,"
362,IX.,How sweet as sweet magnolia bloom
363,IX.,"Embalmed in dews of morning, when"
364,IX.,Rich sunlight leaps from midnight gloom
365,IX.,"Resolved to kiss, and swift to kiss"
366,IX.,Ere yet morn wakens man to bliss.
367,IX.,
368,IX.,
369,X.,X.
370,X.,
371,X.,The days swept on. Her perfect year
372,X.,Was with her now. The sweet perfume
373,X.,"Of womanhood in holy bloom,"
374,X.,"As when red harvest blooms appear,"
375,X.,Possessed her now. The priest did pray
376,X.,That saints alone should pass that way.
377,X.,
378,X.,"A red bird built beneath her roof,"
379,X.,"Brown squirrels crossed her cabin sill,"
380,X.,And welcome came or went at will.
381,X.,"A hermit spider wove his web,"
382,X.,And up against the roof would spin
383,X.,His net to catch mosquitoes in.
384,X.,
385,X.,"The silly elk, the spotted fawn,"
386,X.,"And all dumb beasts that came to drink,"
387,X.,That stealthy stole upon the brink
388,X.,In that dim while that lies between
389,X.,"The coming night and going dawn,"
390,X.,On seeing her familiar face
391,X.,Would fearless stop and stand in place.
392,X.,
393,X.,"She was so kind, the beasts of night"
394,X.,Gave her the road as if her right;
395,X.,The panther crouching overhead
396,X.,In sheen of moss would hear her tread
397,X.,"And bend his eyes, but never stir"
398,X.,Lest he by chance might frighten her.
399,X.,
400,X.,"Yet in her splendid strength, her eyes,"
401,X.,There lay the lightning of the skies;
402,X.,"The love-hate of the lioness,"
403,X.,"To kill the instant, or caress:"
404,X.,A pent-up soul that sometimes grew
405,X.,"Impatient; why, she hardly knew."
406,X.,
407,X.,"At last she sighed, uprose, and threw"
408,X.,Her strong arms out as if to hand
409,X.,"Her love, sun-born and all complete"
410,X.,"At birth, to some brave lover's feet"
411,X.,"On some far, fair, and unseen land,"
412,X.,As knowing now not what to do!
413,X.,
414,X.,
415,XI.,XI.
416,XI.,
417,XI.,"How beautiful she was! Why, she"
418,XI.,Was inspiration! She was born
419,XI.,"To walk God's summer hills at morn,"
420,XI.,Nor waste her by this wood-dark sea.
421,XI.,"What wonder, then, her soul's white wings"
422,XI.,"Beat at its bars, like living things!"
423,XI.,
424,XI.,Once more she sighed! She wandered through
425,XI.,"The sea-bound wood, then stopped and drew"
426,XI.,"Her hand above her face, and swept"
427,XI.,"The lonesome sea, and all day kept"
428,XI.,"Her face to sea, as if she knew"
429,XI.,"Some day, some near or distant day,"
430,XI.,Her destiny should come that way.
431,XI.,
432,XI.,
433,XII.,XII.
434,XII.,
435,XII.,How proud she was! How darkly fair!
436,XII.,"How full of faith, of love, of strength!"
437,XII.,"Her calm, proud eyes! Her great hair's length,--"
438,XII.,"Her long, strong, tumbled, careless hair,"
439,XII.,"Half curled and knotted anywhere,"
440,XII.,"From brow to breast, from cheek to chin,"
441,XII.,For love to trip and tangle in!
442,XII.,
443,XII.,
444,XIII.,XIII.
445,XIII.,
446,XIII.,At last a tall strange sail was seen:
447,XIII.,"It came so slow, so wearily,"
448,XIII.,"Came creeping cautious up the sea,"
449,XIII.,As if it crept from out between
450,XIII.,The half-closed sea and sky that lay
451,XIII.,"Tight wedged together, far away."
452,XIII.,
453,XIII.,"She watched it, wooed it. She did pray"
454,XIII.,"It might not pass her by, but bring"
455,XIII.,"Some love, some hate, some anything,"
456,XIII.,To break the awful loneliness
457,XIII.,That like a nightly nightmare lay
458,XIII.,Upon her proud and pent-up soul
459,XIII.,Until it barely brooked control.
460,XIII.,
461,XIII.,
462,XIV.,XIV.
463,XIV.,
464,XIV.,"The ship crept silent up the sea,"
465,XIV.,And came--
466,XIV.,You cannot understand
467,XIV.,"How fair she was, how sudden she"
468,XIV.,"Had sprung, full-grown, to womanhood:"
469,XIV.,"How gracious, yet how proud and grand;"
470,XIV.,"How glorified, yet fresh and free,"
471,XIV.,"How human, yet how more than good."
472,XIV.,
473,XIV.,
474,XV.,XV.
475,XV.,
476,XV.,"The ship stole slowly, slowly on;--"
477,XV.,Should you in Californian field
478,XV.,In ample flower-time behold
479,XV.,The soft south rose lift like a shield
480,XV.,"Against the sudden sun at dawn,"
481,XV.,"A double handful of heaped gold,"
482,XV.,"Why you, perhaps, might understand"
483,XV.,How splendid and how queenly she
484,XV.,Uprose beside that wood-set sea.
485,XV.,
486,XV.,The storm-worn ship scarce seemed to creep
487,XV.,From wave to wave. It scarce could keep--
488,XV.,"How still this fair girl stood, how fair!"
489,XV.,How proud her presence as she stood
490,XV.,Between that vast sea and west wood!
491,XV.,"How large and liberal her soul,"
492,XV.,"How confident, how purely chare,"
493,XV.,How trusting; how untried the whole
494,XV.,"Great heart, grand faith, that blossomed there!"
495,XV.,
496,XV.,
497,XVI.,XVI.
498,XVI.,
499,XVI.,"Ay, she was as Madonna to"
500,XVI.,"The tawny, lawless, faithful few"
501,XVI.,Who touched her hand and knew her soul:
502,XVI.,"She drew them, drew them as the pole"
503,XVI.,Points all things to itself.
504,XVI.,She drew
505,XVI.,"Men upward as a moon of spring,"
506,XVI.,"High wheeling, vast and bosom-full,"
507,XVI.,"Half clad in clouds and white as wool,"
508,XVI.,Draws all the strong seas following.
509,XVI.,
510,XVI.,"Yet still she moved as sad, as lone"
511,XVI.,"As that same moon that leans above,"
512,XVI.,And seems to search high heaven through
513,XVI.,"For some strong, all-sufficient love,"
514,XVI.,"For one brave love to be her own,"
515,XVI.,"To lean upon, to love, to woo,"
516,XVI.,"To lord her high white world, to yield"
517,XVI.,His clashing sword against her shield.
518,XVI.,
519,XVI.,"Oh, I once knew a sad, white dove"
520,XVI.,"That died for such sufficient love,"
521,XVI.,Such high-born soul with wings to soar:
522,XVI.,"That stood up equal in its place,"
523,XVI.,"That looked love level in the face,"
524,XVI.,Nor wearied love with leaning o'er
525,XVI.,To lift love level where she trod
526,XVI.,In sad delight the hills of God.
527,XVI.,
528,XVI.,
529,XVII.,XVII.
530,XVII.,
531,XVII.,"How slow before the sleeping breeze,"
532,XVII.,That stranger ship from under seas!
533,XVII.,"How like to Dido by her sea,"
534,XVII.,"When reaching arms imploringly,--"
535,XVII.,"Her large, round, rich, impassioned arms,"
536,XVII.,"Tossed forth from all her storied charms,--"
537,XVII.,This one lone maiden leaning stood
538,XVII.,"Above that sea, beside the wood!"
539,XVII.,
540,XVII.,The ship crept strangely up the seas;
541,XVII.,"Her shrouds seemed shreds, her masts seemed trees,--"
542,XVII.,Strange tattered trees of toughest bough
543,XVII.,That knew no cease of storm till now.
544,XVII.,The maiden pitied her; she prayed
545,XVII.,"Her crew might come, nor feel afraid;"
546,XVII.,"She prayed the winds might come,--they came,"
547,XVII.,As birds that answer to a name.
548,XVII.,
549,XVII.,The maiden held her blowing hair
550,XVII.,That bound her beauteous self about;
551,XVII.,The sea-winds housed within her hair:
552,XVII.,"She let it go, it blew in rout"
553,XVII.,About her bosom full and bare.
554,XVII.,"Her round, full arms were free as air,"
555,XVII.,"Her high hands clasped, as clasped in prayer."
556,XVII.,
557,XVII.,
558,XVIII.,XVIII.
559,XVIII.,
560,XVIII.,"The breeze grew bold, the battered ship"
561,XVIII.,Began to flap her weary wings;
562,XVIII.,"The tall, torn masts began to dip"
563,XVIII.,And walk the wave like living things.
564,XVIII.,"She rounded in, she struck the stream,"
565,XVIII.,She moved like some majestic dream.
566,XVIII.,
567,XVIII.,The captain kept her deck. He stood
568,XVIII.,A Hercules among his men;
569,XVIII.,"And now he watched the sea, and then"
570,XVIII.,He peered as if to pierce the wood.
571,XVIII.,"He now looked back, as if pursued,"
572,XVIII.,"Now swept the sea with glass, as though"
573,XVIII.,He fled or feared some hidden foe.
574,XVIII.,
575,XVIII.,"Swift sailing up the river's mouth,"
576,XVIII.,"Swift tacking north, swift tacking south,"
577,XVIII.,He touched the overhanging wood;
578,XVIII.,He tacked his ship; his tall black mast
579,XVIII.,Touched tree-top mosses as he passed;
580,XVIII.,He touched the steep shore where she stood.
581,XVIII.,
582,XVIII.,
583,XIX.,XIX.
584,XIX.,
585,XIX.,"Her hands still clasped as if in prayer,"
586,XIX.,Sweet prayer set to silentness;
587,XIX.,"Her sun-browned throat uplifted, bare"
588,XIX.,And beautiful.
589,XIX.,Her eager face
590,XIX.,"Illumed with love and tenderness,"
591,XIX.,"And all her presence gave such grace,"
592,XIX.,"Dark shadowed in her cloud of hair,"
593,XIX.,That she seemed more than mortal fair.
594,XIX.,
595,XIX.,
596,XX.,XX.
597,XX.,
598,XX.,He saw. He could not speak. No more
599,XX.,With lifted glass he sought the sea;
600,XX.,No more he watched the wild new shore.
601,XX.,"Now foes might come, now friends might flee;"
602,XX.,"He could not speak, he would not stir,--"
603,XX.,"He saw but her, he feared but her."
604,XX.,
605,XX.,"The black ship ground against the shore,"
606,XX.,She ground against the bank as one
607,XX.,"With long and weary journeys done,"
608,XX.,That would not rise to journey more.
609,XX.,
610,XX.,Yet still this Jason silent stood
611,XX.,"And gazed against that sun-lit wood,"
612,XX.,As one whose soul is anywhere.
613,XX.,
614,XX.,"All seemed so fair, so wondrous fair!"
615,XX.,"At last aroused, he stepped to land"
616,XX.,Like some Columbus. They laid hand
617,XX.,"On lands and fruits, and rested there."
618,XX.,
619,XX.,
620,XXI.,XXI.
621,XXI.,
622,XXI.,He found all fairer than fair morn
623,XXI.,"In sylvan land, where waters run"
624,XXI.,"With downward leap against the sun,"
625,XXI.,And full-grown sudden May is born.
626,XXI.,He found her taller than tall corn
627,XXI.,Tiptoe in tassel; found her sweet
628,XXI.,As vale where bees of Hybla meet.
629,XXI.,
630,XXI.,"An unblown rose, an unread book;"
631,XXI.,A wonder in her wondrous eyes;
632,XXI.,"A large, religious, steadfast look"
633,XXI.,"Of faith, of trust,--the look of one"
634,XXI.,New welcomed in her Paradise.
635,XXI.,
636,XXI.,"He read this book,--read on and on"
637,XXI.,From titlepage to colophon:
638,XXI.,"As in cool woods, some summer day,"
639,XXI.,"You find delight in some sweet lay,"
640,XXI.,And so entranced read on and on
641,XXI.,From titlepage to colophon.
642,XXI.,
643,XXI.,
644,XXII.,XXII.
645,XXII.,
646,XXII.,"And who was he that rested there,--"
647,XXII.,"This Hercules, so huge, so rare,"
648,XXII.,"This giant of a grander day,"
649,XXII.,"This Theseus of a nobler Greece,"
650,XXII.,This Jason of the golden fleece?
651,XXII.,And who was he? And who were they
652,XXII.,That came to seek the hidden gold
653,XXII.,Long hallowed from the pirate's hold?
654,XXII.,I do not know. You need not care.
655,XXII.,
656,XXII.,.     .     .     .     .     .
657,XXII.,
658,XXII.,"They loved, this maiden and this man,"
659,XXII.,"And that is all I surely know,--"
660,XXII.,The rest is as the winds that blow.
661,XXII.,"He bowed as brave men bow to fate,"
662,XXII.,Yet proud and resolute and bold;
663,XXII.,"She, coy at first, and mute and cold,"
664,XXII.,"Held back and seemed to hesitate,--"
665,XXII.,Half frightened at this love that ran
666,XXII.,Hard gallop till her hot heart beat
667,XXII.,Like sounding of swift courser's feet.
668,XXII.,
669,XXII.,
670,XXIII.,XXIII.
671,XXIII.,
672,XXIII.,Two strong streams of a land must run
673,XXIII.,Together surely as the sun
674,XXIII.,Succeeds the moon. Who shall gainsay
675,XXIII.,"The fates that reign, that wisely reign?"
676,XXIII.,"Love is, love was, shall be again."
677,XXIII.,"Like death, inevitable it is;"
678,XXIII.,"Perchance, like death, the dawn of bliss."
679,XXIII.,"Let us, then, love the perfect day,"
680,XXIII.,"The twelve o'clock of life, and stop"
681,XXIII.,"The two hands pointing to the top,"
682,XXIII.,And hold them tightly while we may.
683,XXIII.,
684,XXIII.,
685,XXIV.,XXIV.
686,XXIV.,
687,XXIV.,How piteous strange is love! The walks
688,XXIV.,By wooded ways; the silent talks
689,XXIV.,Beneath the broad and fragrant bough.
690,XXIV.,"The dark deep wood, the dense black dell,"
691,XXIV.,Where scarce a single gold beam fell
692,XXIV.,From out the sun.
693,XXIV.,They rested now
694,XXIV.,On mossy trunk. They wandered then
695,XXIV.,Where never fell the feet of men.
696,XXIV.,
697,XXIV.,"Then longer walks, then deeper woods,"
698,XXIV.,"Then sweeter talks, sufficient sweet,"
699,XXIV.,"In denser, deeper solitudes,--"
700,XXIV.,Dear careless ways for careless feet;
701,XXIV.,"Sweet talks of paradise for two,"
702,XXIV.,"And only two, to watch or woo."
703,XXIV.,
704,XXIV.,She rarely spake. All seemed a dream
705,XXIV.,She would not waken from. She lay
706,XXIV.,"All night but waiting for the day,"
707,XXIV.,"When she might see his face, and deem"
708,XXIV.,"This man, with all his perils passed,"
709,XXIV.,Had found the Lotus-land at last.
710,XXIV.,
711,XXIV.,
712,XXV.,XXV.
713,XXV.,
714,XXV.,"The year waxed fervid, and the sun"
715,XXV.,Fell central down. The forest lay
716,XXV.,A-quiver in the heat. The sea
717,XXV.,Below the steep bank seemed to run
718,XXV.,A molten sea of gold.
719,XXV.,Away
720,XXV.,Against the gray and rock-built isles
721,XXV.,That broke the molten watery miles
722,XXV.,"Where lonesome sea-cows called all day,"
723,XXV.,The sudden sun smote angrily.
724,XXV.,
725,XXV.,"Therefore the need of deeper deeps,"
726,XXV.,"Of denser shade for man and maid,"
727,XXV.,"Of higher heights, of cooler steeps,"
728,XXV.,Where all day long the sea-wind stayed.
729,XXV.,
730,XXV.,They sought the rock-reared steep. The breeze
731,XXV.,Swept twenty thousand miles of seas;
732,XXV.,Had twenty thousand things to say
733,XXV.,"Of love, of lovers of Cathay,"
734,XXV.,To lovers 'mid these high-held trees.
735,XXV.,
736,XXV.,
737,XXVI.,XXVI.
738,XXVI.,
739,XXVI.,"To left, to right, below the height,"
740,XXVI.,"Below the wood by wave and stream,"
741,XXVI.,Plumed pampas grasses grew to gleam
742,XXVI.,"And bend their lordly plumes, and run"
743,XXVI.,"And shake, as if in very fright"
744,XXVI.,Before sharp lances of the sun.
745,XXVI.,
746,XXVI.,They saw the tide-bound battered ship
747,XXVI.,Creep close below against the bank;
748,XXVI.,They saw it cringe and shrink; it shrank
749,XXVI.,As shrinks some huge black beast with fear
750,XXVI.,When some uncommon dread is near.
751,XXVI.,"They heard the melting resin drip,"
752,XXVI.,As drip the last brave blood-drops when
753,XXVI.,Life's battle waxes hot with men.
754,XXVI.,
755,XXVI.,
756,XXVII.,XXVII.
757,XXVII.,
758,XXVII.,"Yet what to her were burning seas,"
759,XXVII.,Or what to him was forest flame?
760,XXVII.,"They loved; they loved the glorious trees,"
761,XXVII.,"The gleaming tides, or rise or fall;"
762,XXVII.,They loved the lisping winds that came
763,XXVII.,"From sea-lost spice-set isles unknown,"
764,XXVII.,With breath not warmer than their own:
765,XXVII.,"They loved, they loved,--and that was all."
766,XXVII.,
767,XXVII.,
768,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
769,XXVIII.,
770,XXVIII.,Full noon! Below the ancient moss
771,XXVIII.,"With mighty boughs high clanged across,"
772,XXVIII.,"The man with sweet words, over-sweet,"
773,XXVIII.,"Fell pleading, plaintive, at her feet."
774,XXVIII.,
775,XXVIII.,"He spake of love, of boundless love,--"
776,XXVIII.,"Of love that knew no other land,"
777,XXVIII.,"Or face, or place, or anything;"
778,XXVIII.,Of love that like the wearied dove
779,XXVIII.,"Could light nowhere, but kept the wing"
780,XXVIII.,"Till she alone put forth her hand,"
781,XXVIII.,And so received it in her ark
782,XXVIII.,From seas that shake against the dark!
783,XXVIII.,
784,XXVIII.,"He clasped her hands, climbed past her knees,"
785,XXVIII.,"Forgot her hands and kissed her hair,--"
786,XXVIII.,"The while her two hands clasped in prayer,"
787,XXVIII.,And fair face lifted to the trees.
788,XXVIII.,
789,XXVIII.,"Her proud breast heaved, her pure proud breast"
790,XXVIII.,Rose like the waves in their unrest
791,XXVIII.,When counter storms possess the seas.
792,XXVIII.,"Her mouth, her arched, uplifted mouth,"
793,XXVIII.,"Her ardent mouth that thirsted so,--"
794,XXVIII.,No glowing love-song of the South
795,XXVIII.,Can say; no man can say or know
796,XXVIII.,"The glory there, and so live on"
797,XXVIII.,Content without that glory gone!
798,XXVIII.,
799,XXVIII.,Her face still lifted up. And she
800,XXVIII.,Disdained the cup of passion he
801,XXVIII.,Hard pressed her panting lips to touch.
802,XXVIII.,"She dashed it by despised, and she"
803,XXVIII.,"Caught fast her breath. She trembled much,"
804,XXVIII.,"And sudden rose full height, and stood"
805,XXVIII.,An empress in high womanhood:
806,XXVIII.,"She stood a tower, tall as when"
807,XXVIII.,Proud Roman mothers suckled men
808,XXVIII.,Of old-time truth and taught them such.
809,XXVIII.,
810,XXVIII.,
811,XXIX.,XXIX.
812,XXIX.,
813,XXIX.,Her soul surged vast as space is. She
814,XXIX.,Was trembling as a courser when
815,XXIX.,"His thin flank quivers, and his feet"
816,XXIX.,"Touch velvet on the turf, and he"
817,XXIX.,"Is all afoam, alert, and fleet"
818,XXIX.,"As sunlight glancing on the sea,"
819,XXIX.,And full of triumph before men.
820,XXIX.,
821,XXIX.,"At last she bended some her face,"
822,XXIX.,"Half leaned, then put him back a pace,"
823,XXIX.,And met his eyes.
824,XXIX.,"Calm, silently"
825,XXIX.,"Her eyes looked deep into his eyes,--"
826,XXIX.,As maidens down some mossy well
827,XXIX.,Do peer in hope by chance to tell
828,XXIX.,By image there what future lies
829,XXIX.,"Before them, and what face shall be"
830,XXIX.,The pole-star of their destiny.
831,XXIX.,
832,XXIX.,Pure Nature's lover! Loving him
833,XXIX.,With love that made all pathways dim
834,XXIX.,"And difficult where he was not,--"
835,XXIX.,Then marvel not at form forgot.
836,XXIX.,And who shall chide? Doth priest know aught
837,XXIX.,"Of sign, or holy unction brought"
838,XXIX.,"From over seas, that ever can"
839,XXIX.,Make man love maid or maid love man
840,XXIX.,"One whit the more, one bit the less,"
841,XXIX.,For all his mummeries to bless?
842,XXIX.,"Yea, all his blessing or his ban?"
843,XXIX.,
844,XXIX.,The winds breathed warm as Araby:
845,XXIX.,"She leaned upon his breast, she lay"
846,XXIX.,A wide-winged swan with folded wing.
847,XXIX.,"He drowned his hot face in her hair,"
848,XXIX.,He heard her great heart rise and sing;
849,XXIX.,He felt her bosom swell.
850,XXIX.,The air
851,XXIX.,Swooned sweet with perfume of her form.
852,XXIX.,"Her breast was warm, her breath was warm,"
853,XXIX.,And warm her warm and perfumed mouth
854,XXIX.,As summer journeys through the South.
855,XXIX.,
856,XXIX.,
857,XXX.,XXX.
858,XXX.,
859,XXX.,"The argent sea surged steep below,"
860,XXX.,Surged languid in a tropic glow;
861,XXX.,And two great hearts kept surging so!
862,XXX.,
863,XXX.,The fervid kiss of heaven lay
864,XXX.,Precipitate on wood and sea.
865,XXX.,"Two great souls glowed with ecstasy,"
866,XXX.,The sea glowed scarce as warm as they.
867,XXX.,
868,XXX.,
869,XXXI.,XXXI.
870,XXXI.,
871,XXXI.,'Twas love's low amber afternoon.
872,XXXI.,"Two far-off pheasants thrummed a tune,"
873,XXXI.,A cricket clanged a restful air.
874,XXXI.,The dreamful billows beat a rune
875,XXXI.,Like heart regrets.
876,XXXI.,Around her head
877,XXXI.,There shone a halo. Men have said
878,XXXI.,'Twas from a dash of Titian
879,XXXI.,That flooded all her storm of hair
880,XXXI.,"In gold and glory. But they knew,"
881,XXXI.,"Yea, all men know there ever grew"
882,XXXI.,A halo round about her head
883,XXXI.,Like sunlight scarcely vanishèd.
884,XXXI.,
885,XXXI.,
886,XXXII.,XXXII.
887,XXXII.,
888,XXXII.,How still she was! She only knew
889,XXXII.,His love. She saw no life beyond.
890,XXXII.,She loved with love that only lives
891,XXXII.,"Outside itself and selfishness,--"
892,XXXII.,A love that glows in its excess;
893,XXXII.,"A love that melts pure gold, and gives"
894,XXXII.,Thenceforth to all who come to woo
895,XXXII.,"No coins but this face stamped thereon,--"
896,XXXII.,"Ay, this one image stamped upon"
897,XXXII.,"Its face, with some dim date long gone."
898,XXXII.,
899,XXXII.,
900,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
901,XXXIII.,
902,XXXIII.,They kept the headland high; the ship
903,XXXIII.,"Below began to chafe her chain,"
904,XXXIII.,To groan as some great beast in pain;
905,XXXIII.,While white fear leapt from lip to lip:
906,XXXIII.,"""The woods are fire! the woods are flame!"
907,XXXIII.,"Come down and save us, in God's name!"""
908,XXXIII.,
909,XXXIII.,"He heard! he did not speak or stir,--"
910,XXXIII.,"He thought of her, of only her."
911,XXXIII.,"While flames behind, before them lay"
912,XXXIII.,To hold the stoutest heart at bay!
913,XXXIII.,
914,XXXIII.,"Strange sounds were heard far up the flood,--"
915,XXXIII.,"Strange, savage sounds that chilled the blood!"
916,XXXIII.,Then sudden from the dense dark wood
917,XXXIII.,"Above, about them where they stood"
918,XXXIII.,A thousand beasts came peering out;
919,XXXIII.,"And now was thrust a long black snout,"
920,XXXIII.,And now a tusky mouth. It was
921,XXXIII.,A sight to make the stoutest pause.
922,XXXIII.,
923,XXXIII.,"""Cut loose the ship!"" the black mate cried;"
924,XXXIII.,"""Cut loose the ship!"" the crew replied."
925,XXXIII.,They drove into the sea. It lay
926,XXXIII.,As light as ever middle day.
927,XXXIII.,
928,XXXIII.,"The while their half-blind bitch, that sat"
929,XXXIII.,"All slobber-mouthed, and monkish cowled"
930,XXXIII.,"With great, broad, floppy, leathern ears,"
931,XXXIII.,"Amid the men, rose up and howled,"
932,XXXIII.,"And doleful howled her plaintive fears,"
933,XXXIII.,While all looked mute aghast thereat.
934,XXXIII.,"It was the grimmest eve, I think,"
935,XXXIII.,That ever hung on Hades' brink.
936,XXXIII.,
937,XXXIII.,"Great broad-winged bats possessed the air,"
938,XXXIII.,Bats whirling blindly everywhere;
939,XXXIII.,It was such troubled twilight eve
940,XXXIII.,As never mortal would believe.
941,XXXIII.,
942,XXXIII.,
943,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
944,XXXIV.,
945,XXXIV.,Some say the crazed hag lit the wood
946,XXXIV.,In circle where the lovers stood;
947,XXXIV.,Some say the gray priest feared the crew
948,XXXIV.,Might find at last the hoard of gold
949,XXXIV.,"Long hidden from the black ship's hold,--"
950,XXXIV.,I doubt me if men ever knew.
951,XXXIV.,"But such mad, howling, flame-lit shore"
952,XXXIV.,No mortal ever saw before.
953,XXXIV.,
954,XXXIV.,"Huge beasts above that shining sea,"
955,XXXIV.,"Wild, hideous beasts with shaggy hair,"
956,XXXIV.,"With red mouths lifting in the air,"
957,XXXIV.,"They piteous howled, and plaintively,--"
958,XXXIV.,"The wildest sounds, the weirdest sight"
959,XXXIV.,That ever shook the walls of night.
960,XXXIV.,
961,XXXIV.,"How lorn they howled, with lifted head,"
962,XXXIV.,To dim and distant isles that lay
963,XXXIV.,"Wedged tight along a line of red,"
964,XXXIV.,Caught in the closing gates of day
965,XXXIV.,"'Twixt sky and sea and far away,--"
966,XXXIV.,It was the saddest sound to hear
967,XXXIV.,That ever struck on human ear.
968,XXXIV.,
969,XXXIV.,They doleful called; and answered they
970,XXXIV.,"The plaintive sea-cows far away,--"
971,XXXIV.,"The great sea-cows that called from isles,"
972,XXXIV.,"Away across wide watery miles,"
973,XXXIV.,"With dripping mouths and lolling tongue,"
974,XXXIV.,"As if they called for captured young,--"
975,XXXIV.,
976,XXXIV.,The huge sea-cows that called the whiles
977,XXXIV.,Their great wide mouths were mouthing moss;
978,XXXIV.,And still they doleful called across
979,XXXIV.,From isles beyond the watery miles.
980,XXXIV.,No sound can half so doleful be
981,XXXIV.,As sea-cows calling from the sea.
982,XXXIV.,
983,XXXIV.,
984,XXXV.,XXXV.
985,XXXV.,
986,XXXV.,The drowned sun sank and died. He lay
987,XXXV.,In seas of blood. He sinking drew
988,XXXV.,"The gates of sunset sudden to,"
989,XXXV.,"Where shattered day in fragments lay,"
990,XXXV.,"And night came, moving in mad flame:"
991,XXXV.,"The night came, lighted as he came,"
992,XXXV.,As lighted by high summer sun
993,XXXV.,Descending through the burning blue.
994,XXXV.,"It was a gold and amber hue,"
995,XXXV.,And all hues blended into one.
996,XXXV.,"The night spilled splendor where she came,"
997,XXXV.,And filled the yellow world with flame.
998,XXXV.,
999,XXXV.,"The moon came on, came leaning low"
1000,XXXV.,Along the far sea-isles aglow;
1001,XXXV.,She fell along that amber flood
1002,XXXV.,A silver flame in seas of blood.
1003,XXXV.,"It was the strangest moon, ah me!"
1004,XXXV.,That ever settled on God's sea.

1011,XXXVI.,"You could not step, you would not pass,"
1012,XXXVI.,"And you would hesitate to stir,"
1013,XXXVI.,"Lest in some sudden, hurried tread"
1014,XXXVI.,Your foot struck some unbruisèd head:
1015,XXXVI.,
1016,XXXVI.,"They slid in streams into the stream,--"
1017,XXXVI.,It seemed like some infernal dream;
1018,XXXVI.,"They curved, and graceful curved across,"
1019,XXXVI.,"Like graceful, waving sea-green moss,--"
1020,XXXVI.,There is no art of man can make
1021,XXXVI.,A ripple like a rippling snake!
1022,XXXVI.,
1023,XXXVI.,
1024,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
1025,XXXVII.,
1026,XXXVII.,"Abandoned, lorn, the lovers stood,"
1027,XXXVII.,"Abandoned there, death in the air!"
1028,XXXVII.,"That beetling steep, that blazing wood,--"
1029,XXXVII.,Red flame! and red flame everywhere!
1030,XXXVII.,"Yet was he born to strive, to bear"
1031,XXXVII.,The front of battle. He would die
1032,XXXVII.,"In noble effort, and defy"
1033,XXXVII.,The grizzled visage of despair.
1034,XXXVII.,
1035,XXXVII.,He threw his two strong arms full length
1036,XXXVII.,As if to surely test their strength;
1037,XXXVII.,"Then tore his vestments, textile things"
1038,XXXVII.,That could but tempt the demon wings
1039,XXXVII.,"Of flame that girt them round about,"
1040,XXXVII.,Then threw his garments to the air
1041,XXXVII.,"As one that laughed at death, at doubt,"
1042,XXXVII.,And like a god stood grand and bare.
1043,XXXVII.,
1044,XXXVII.,She did not hesitate; she knew
1045,XXXVII.,The need of action; swift she threw
1046,XXXVII.,"Her burning vestments by, and bound"
1047,XXXVII.,Her wondrous wealth of hair that fell
1048,XXXVII.,An all-concealing cloud around
1049,XXXVII.,"Her glorious presence, as he came"
1050,XXXVII.,"To seize and bear her through the flame,--"
1051,XXXVII.,An Orpheus out of burning hell!
1052,XXXVII.,
1053,XXXVII.,"He leaned above her, wound his arm"
1054,XXXVII.,"About her splendor, while the noon"
1055,XXXVII.,"Of flood-tide, manhood, flushed his face,"
1056,XXXVII.,And high flames leapt the high headland!--
1057,XXXVII.,"They stood as twin-hewn statues stand,"
1058,XXXVII.,High lifted in some storied place.
1059,XXXVII.,
1060,XXXVII.,"He clasped her close, he spoke of death,--"
1061,XXXVII.,Of death and love in the same breath.
1062,XXXVII.,He clasped her close; her bosom lay
1063,XXXVII.,Like ship safe anchored in some bay.
1064,XXXVII.,
1065,XXXVII.,
1066,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
1067,XXXVIII.,
1068,XXXVIII.,The flames! They could not stand or stay;
1069,XXXVIII.,"Before the beetling steep, the sea!"
1070,XXXVIII.,"But at his feet a narrow way,"
1071,XXXVIII.,"A short steep path, pitched suddenly"
1072,XXXVIII.,"Safe open to the river's beach,"
1073,XXXVIII.,"Where lay a small white isle in reach,--"
1074,XXXVIII.,"A small, white, rippled isle of sand"
1075,XXXVIII.,Where yet the two might safely land.
1076,XXXVIII.,
1077,XXXVIII.,"And there, through smoke and flame, behold"
1078,XXXVIII.,"The priest stood safe, yet all appalled!"
1079,XXXVIII.,"He reached the cross; he cried, he called;"
1080,XXXVIII.,He waved his high-held cross of gold.
1081,XXXVIII.,"He called and called, he bade them fly"
1082,XXXVIII.,"Through flames to him, nor bide and die!"
1083,XXXVIII.,
1084,XXXVIII.,"Her lover saw; he saw, and knew"
1085,XXXVIII.,His giant strength would bear her through.
1086,XXXVIII.,And yet he would not start or stir.
1087,XXXVIII.,"He clasped her close as death can hold,"
1088,XXXVIII.,"Or dying miser clasp his gold,--"
1089,XXXVIII.,His hold became a part of her.
1090,XXXVIII.,
1091,XXXVIII.,He would not give her up! He would
1092,XXXVIII.,Not bear her waveward though he could!
1093,XXXVIII.,That height was heaven; the wave was hell.
1094,XXXVIII.,"He clasped her close,--what else had done"
1095,XXXVIII.,The manliest man beneath the sun?
1096,XXXVIII.,Was it not well? was it not well?
1097,XXXVIII.,
1098,XXXVIII.,"O man, be glad! be grandly glad,"
1099,XXXVIII.,And kinglike walk thy ways of death!
1100,XXXVIII.,For more than years of bliss you had
1101,XXXVIII.,That one brief time you breathed her breath.
1102,XXXVIII.,"Yea, more than years upon a throne"
1103,XXXVIII.,"That one brief time you held her fast,"
1104,XXXVIII.,"Soul surged to soul, vehement, vast,--"
1105,XXXVIII.,"True breast to breast, and all your own."
1106,XXXVIII.,
1107,XXXVIII.,"Live me one day, one narrow night,"
1108,XXXVIII.,One second of supreme delight
1109,XXXVIII.,"Like that, and I will blow like chaff"
1110,XXXVIII.,"The hollow years aside, and laugh"
1111,XXXVIII.,"A loud triumphant laugh, and I,"
1112,XXXVIII.,"King-like and crowned, will gladly die."
1113,XXXVIII.,
1114,XXXVIII.,"Oh, but to wrap my love with flame!"
1115,XXXVIII.,"With flame within, with flame without!"
1116,XXXVIII.,"Oh, but to die like this, nor doubt--"
1117,XXXVIII.,To die and know her still the same!
1118,XXXVIII.,To know that down the ghostly shore
1119,XXXVIII.,Snow-white she waits me evermore!
1120,XXXVIII.,
1121,XXXVIII.,
1122,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
1123,XXXIX.,
1124,XXXIX.,"He poised her, held her high in air,--"
1125,XXXIX.,"His great strong limbs, his great arm's length!--"
1126,XXXIX.,Then turned his knotted shoulders bare
1127,XXXIX.,"As birth-time in his splendid strength,"
1128,XXXIX.,"And strode, strode with a lordly stride"
1129,XXXIX.,To where the high and wood-hung edge
1130,XXXIX.,"Looked down, far down upon the molten tide."
1131,XXXIX.,"The flames leapt with him to the ledge,"
1132,XXXIX.,The flames leapt leering at his side.
1133,XXXIX.,
1134,XXXIX.,
1135,XL.,XL.
1136,XL.,
1137,XL.,He leaned above the ledge. Below
1138,XL.,"He saw the black ship idly cruise,--"
1139,XL.,"A midge below, a mile below."
1140,XL.,His limbs were knotted as the thews
1141,XL.,Of Hercules in his death-throe.
1142,XL.,
1143,XL.,The flame! the flame! the envious flame!
1144,XL.,"She wound her arms, she wound her hair"
1145,XL.,"About his tall form, grand and bare,"
1146,XL.,To stay the fierce flame where it came.
1147,XL.,
1148,XL.,"The black ship, like some moonlit wreck,"
1149,XL.,Below along the burning sea
1150,XL.,"Crept on and on all silently,"
1151,XL.,With silent pygmies on her deck.
1152,XL.,
1153,XL.,"That midge-like ship far, far below;"
1154,XL.,That mirage lifting from the hill!
1155,XL.,"His flame-lit form began to grow,--"
1156,XL.,To grow and grow more grandly still.
1157,XL.,"The ship so small, that form so tall,"
1158,XL.,It grew to tower over all.
1159,XL.,
1160,XL.,"A tall Colossus, bronze and gold,"
1161,XL.,As if that flame-lit form were he
1162,XL.,"Who once bestrode the Rhodian sea,"
1163,XL.,And ruled the watery world of old:
1164,XL.,As if the lost Colossus stood
1165,XL.,Above that burning sea of wood.
1166,XL.,
1167,XL.,"And she, that shapely form upheld,"
1168,XL.,"Held high, as if to touch the sky,"
1169,XL.,"What airy shape, how shapely high,--"
1170,XL.,A goddess of the seas of eld!
1171,XL.,
1172,XL.,"Her hand upheld, her high right hand,"
1173,XL.,As if she would forget the land;
1174,XL.,"As if to gather stars, and heap"
1175,XL.,The stars like torches there to light
1176,XL.,Her Hero's path across the deep
1177,XL.,To some far isle that fearful night.
1178,XL.,
1179,XL.,"It was as if Colossus came,"
1180,XL.,Came proudly reaching from the flame
1181,XL.,"Above the sea in sheen of gold,"
1182,XL.,His sea-bride leaping from his hold;
1183,XL.,"The lost Colossus, and his bride"
1184,XL.,In bronze perfection at his side:
1185,XL.,As if the lost Colossus came
1186,XL.,"Companioned from the past, his bride"
1187,XL.,With torch all faithful at his side:
1188,XL.,
1189,XL.,With star-tipped torch that reached and rolled
1190,XL.,Through cloud-built corridors of gold:
1191,XL.,"His bride, austere and stern and grand,--"
1192,XL.,"Bartholdi's goddess by the sea,"
1193,XL.,"Far lifting, lighting Liberty"
1194,XL.,From prison seas to Freedom's land.
1195,XL.,
1196,XL.,
1197,XLI.,XLI.
1198,XLI.,
1199,XLI.,"The flame! the envious flame, it leapt"
1200,XLI.,"Enraged to see such majesty,"
1201,XLI.,Such scorn of death; such kingly scorn.
1202,XLI.,Then like some lightning-riven tree
1203,XLI.,They sank down in that flame--and slept
1204,XLI.,And all was hushed above that steep
1205,XLI.,"So still, that they might sleep and sleep;"
1206,XLI.,As still as when a day is born.
1207,XLI.,
1208,XLI.,At last! from out the embers leapt
1209,XLI.,"Two shafts of light above the night,--"
1210,XLI.,Two wings of flame that lifting swept
1211,XLI.,"In steady, calm, and upward flight;"
1212,XLI.,Two wings of flame against the white
1213,XLI.,"Far-lifting, tranquil, snowy cone;"
1214,XLI.,"Two wings of love, two wings of light,"
1215,XLI.,"Far, far above that troubled night,"
1216,XLI.,"As mounting, mounting to God's throne."
1217,XLI.,
1218,XLI.,
1219,XLII.,XLII.
1220,XLII.,
1221,XLII.,And all night long that upward light
1222,XLII.,Lit up the sea-cow's bed below:
1223,XLII.,The far sea-cows still calling so
1224,XLII.,It seemed as they must call all night.
1225,XLII.,"All night! there was no night. Nay, nay,"
1226,XLII.,There was no night. The night that lay
1227,XLII.,"Between that awful eve and day,--"
1228,XLII.,That nameless night was burned away.

1394,II.,A lone sweet lady prays within.
1395,II.,The stranger passes by the door--
1396,II.,Will he not pray? Is he so poor

1473,III.,In circling chariot is rolled;
1474,III.,"The golden stars are spun and reeled,"
1475,III.,And woven into cloth of gold.
1476,III.,
1477,III.,The white magnolia fills the night
1478,III.,"With perfume, as the proud moon fills"
1479,III.,The glad earth with her ample light
1480,III.,From out her awful sapphire hills.
1481,III.,
1482,III.,White orange blossoms fill the boughs
1483,III.,"Above, about the old church door,--"
1484,III.,"They wait the bride, the bridal vows,--"
1485,III.,They never hung so fair before.
1486,III.,
1487,III.,The two men glare as dark as sin!
1488,III.,"And yet all seems so fair, so white,"
1489,III.,"You would not reckon it was night,--"
1490,III.,The while the lady prays within.
1491,III.,
1492,III.,
1493,IV.,IV.
1494,IV.,
1495,IV.,"She prays so very long and late,--"
1496,IV.,"The two men, weary, waiting there,--"
1497,IV.,The great magnolia at the gate
1498,IV.,Bends drowsily above her prayer.
1499,IV.,
1500,IV.,"The cypress in his cloak of moss,"
1501,IV.,"That watches on in silent gloom,"
1502,IV.,Has leaned and shaped a shadow-cross
1503,IV.,"Above the nameless, lowly tomb."
1504,IV.,
1505,IV.,What can she pray for? What her sin?
1506,IV.,What folly of a maid so fair?
1507,IV.,What shadows bind the wondrous hair
1508,IV.,Of one who prays so long within?
1509,IV.,
1510,IV.,"The palm-trees guard in regiment,"
1511,IV.,Stand right and left without the gate;
1512,IV.,The myrtle-moss trees wait and wait;
1513,IV.,The tall magnolia leans intent.
1514,IV.,
1515,IV.,"The cypress trees, on gnarled old knees,"
1516,IV.,Far out the dank and marshy deep
1517,IV.,"Where slimy monsters groan and creep,"
1518,IV.,Kneel with her in their marshy seas.
1519,IV.,
1520,IV.,What can her sin be? Who shall know?
1521,IV.,"The night flies by,--a bird on wing;"
1522,IV.,The men no longer to and fro
1523,IV.,"Stride up and down, or anything."
1524,IV.,
1525,IV.,For one so weary and so old
1526,IV.,Has hardly strength to stride or stir;
1527,IV.,"He can but hold his bags of gold,--"
1528,IV.,But hug his gold and wait for her.
1529,IV.,
1530,IV.,"The two stand still,--stand face to face."
1531,IV.,The moon slides on; the midnight air
1532,IV.,Is perfumed as a house of prayer--
1533,IV.,The maiden keeps her holy place.
1534,IV.,
1535,IV.,"Two men! And one is gray, but one"
1536,IV.,Scarce lifts a full-grown face as yet:
1537,IV.,"With light foot on life's threshold set,--"
1538,IV.,Is he the other's sun-born son?
1539,IV.,
1540,IV.,"And one is of the land of snow,"
1541,IV.,And one is of the land of sun;
1542,IV.,"A black-eyed burning youth is one,"
1543,IV.,But one has pulses cold and slow:
1544,IV.,
1545,IV.,"Ay, cold and slow from clime of snow"
1546,IV.,"Where Nature's bosom, icy bound,"
1547,IV.,"Holds all her forces, hard, profound,--"
1548,IV.,Holds close where all the South lets go.
1549,IV.,
1550,IV.,"Blame not the sun, blame not the snows;"
1551,IV.,"God's great schoolhouse for all is clime,"
1552,IV.,"The great school-teacher, Father Time;"
1553,IV.,And each has borne as best he knows.
1554,IV.,
1555,IV.,"At last the elder speaks,--he cries,--"
1556,IV.,He speaks as if his heart would break;
1557,IV.,"He speaks out as a man that dies,--"
1558,IV.,As dying for some lost love's sake:
1559,IV.,
1560,IV.,"""Come, take this bag of gold, and go!"
1561,IV.,"Come, take one bag! See, I have two!"
1562,IV.,"Oh, why stand silent, staring so,"
1563,IV.,When I would share my gold with you?
1564,IV.,
1565,IV.,"""Come, take this gold! See how I pray!"
1566,IV.,"See how I bribe, and beg, and buy,--"
1567,IV.,"Ay, buy! buy love, as you, too, may"
1568,IV.,Some day before you come to die.
1569,IV.,
1570,IV.,"""God! take this gold, I beg, I pray!"
1571,IV.,I beg as one who thirsting cries
1572,IV.,"For but one drop of drink, and dies"
1573,IV.,"In some lone, loveless desert way."
1574,IV.,
1575,IV.,"""You hesitate? Still hesitate?"
1576,IV.,Stand silent still and mock my pain?
1577,IV.,"Still mock to see me wait and wait,"
1578,IV.,"And wait her love, as earth waits rain?"""
1579,IV.,
1580,IV.,
1581,V.,V.
1582,V.,
1583,V.,O broken ship! O starless shore!
1584,V.,"O black and everlasting night,"
1585,V.,Where love comes never any more
1586,V.,To light man's way with heaven's light.
1587,V.,
1588,V.,A godless man with bags of gold
1589,V.,I think a most unholy sight;
1590,V.,"Ah, who so desolate at night"
1591,V.,Amid death's sleepers still and cold?
1592,V.,
1593,V.,A godless man on holy ground
1594,V.,I think a most unholy sight.
1595,V.,I hear death trailing like a hound
1596,V.,"Hard after him, and swift to bite."
1597,V.,
1598,V.,
1599,VI.,VI.
1600,VI.,
1601,VI.,The vast moon settles to the west:
1602,VI.,"Two men beside a nameless tomb,"
1603,VI.,"And one would sit thereon to rest,--"
1604,VI.,"Ay, rest below, if there were room."
1605,VI.,
1606,VI.,"What is this rest of death, sweet friend?"
1607,VI.,"What is the rising up,--and where?"
1608,VI.,"I say, death is a lengthened prayer,"
1609,VI.,"A longer night, a larger end."
1610,VI.,
1611,VI.,Hear you the lesson I once learned:
1612,VI.,I died; I sailed a million miles
1613,VI.,"Through dreamful, flowery, restful isles,--"
1614,VI.,"She was not there, and I returned."
1615,VI.,
1616,VI.,I say the shores of death and sleep
1617,VI.,"Are one; that when we, wearied, come"
1618,VI.,"To Lethe's waters, and lie dumb,"
1619,VI.,"'Tis death, not sleep, holds us to keep."
1620,VI.,
1621,VI.,"Yea, we lie dead for need of rest"
1622,VI.,And so the soul drifts out and o'er
1623,VI.,The vast still waters to the shore
1624,VI.,"Beyond, in pleasant, tranquil quest:"
1625,VI.,
1626,VI.,"It sails straight on, forgetting pain,"
1627,VI.,"Past isles of peace, to perfect rest,--"
1628,VI.,"Now were it best abide, or best"
1629,VI.,Return and take up life again?
1630,VI.,
1631,VI.,"And that is all of death there is,"
1632,VI.,Believe me. If you find your love
1633,VI.,"In that far land, then like the dove"
1634,VI.,"Abide, and turn not back to this."
1635,VI.,
1636,VI.,But if you find your love not there;
1637,VI.,"Or if your feet feel sure, and you"
1638,VI.,"Have still allotted work to do,--"
1639,VI.,"Why, then return to toil and care."
1640,VI.,
1641,VI.,Death is no mystery. 'Tis plain
1642,VI.,"If death be mystery, then sleep"
1643,VI.,"Is mystery thrice strangely deep,--"
1644,VI.,For oh this coming back again!
1645,VI.,
1646,VI.,Austerest ferryman of souls!
1647,VI.,"I see the gleam of solid shores,"
1648,VI.,I hear thy steady stroke of oars
1649,VI.,Above the wildest wave that rolls.
1650,VI.,
1651,VI.,"O Charon, keep thy sombre ships!"
1652,VI.,"We come, with neither myrrh nor balm,"
1653,VI.,"Nor silver piece in open palm,"
1654,VI.,But lone white silence on our lips.
1655,VI.,
1656,VI.,
1657,VII.,VII.
1658,VII.,
1659,VII.,She prays so long! she prays so late!
1660,VII.,What sin in all this flower-land
1661,VII.,Against her supplicating hand
1662,VII.,Could have in heaven any weight?
1663,VII.,
1664,VII.,Prays she for her sweet self alone?
1665,VII.,"Prays she for some one far away,"
1666,VII.,"Or some one near and dear to-day,"
1667,VII.,"Or some poor, lorn, lost soul unknown?"
1668,VII.,
1669,VII.,It seems to me a selfish thing
1670,VII.,To pray forever for one's self;
1671,VII.,It seems to me like heaping pelf
1672,VII.,In heaven by hard reckoning.
1673,VII.,
1674,VII.,"Why, I would rather stoop, and bear"
1675,VII.,"My load of sin, and bear it well"
1676,VII.,"And bravely down to burning hell,"
1677,VII.,Than ever pray one selfish prayer!
1678,VII.,
1679,VII.,
1680,VIII.,VIII.
1681,VIII.,
1682,VIII.,The swift chameleon in the gloom--
1683,VIII.,This silence it is so profound!--
1684,VIII.,"Forsakes its bough, glides to the ground,"
1685,VIII.,"Then up, and lies across the tomb."
1686,VIII.,
1687,VIII.,"It erst was green as olive-leaf,"
1688,VIII.,It then grew gray as myrtle moss
1689,VIII.,The time it slid the moss across;
1690,VIII.,But now 'tis marble-white with grief.
1691,VIII.,
1692,VIII.,The little creature's hues are gone;
1693,VIII.,Here in the pale and ghostly light
1694,VIII.,"It lies so pale, so panting white,--"
1695,VIII.,White as the tomb it lies upon.
1696,VIII.,
1697,VIII.,"The two men by that nameless tomb,"
1698,VIII.,And both so still! You might have said
1699,VIII.,"These two men, they are also dead,"
1700,VIII.,And only waiting here for room.
1701,VIII.,
1702,VIII.,How still beneath the orange-bough!
1703,VIII.,"How tall was one, how bowed was one!"
1704,VIII.,"The one was as a journey done,"
1705,VIII.,The other as beginning now.
1706,VIII.,
1707,VIII.,"And one was young,--young with that youth"
1708,VIII.,Eternal that belongs to truth;
1709,VIII.,"And one was old,--old with the years"
1710,VIII.,That follow fast on doubts and fears.
1711,VIII.,
1712,VIII.,And yet the habit of command
1713,VIII.,"Was his, in every stubborn part;"
1714,VIII.,"No common knave was he at heart,"
1715,VIII.,Nor his the common coward's hand.
1716,VIII.,
1717,VIII.,"He looked the young man in the face,"
1718,VIII.,"So full of hate, so frank of hate;"
1719,VIII.,"The other, standing in his place,"
1720,VIII.,Stared back as straight and hard as fate.
1721,VIII.,
1722,VIII.,"And now he sudden turned away,"
1723,VIII.,"And now he paced the path, and now"
1724,VIII.,"Came back, beneath the orange-bough"
1725,VIII.,"Pale-browed, with lips as cold as clay."
1726,VIII.,
1727,VIII.,"As mute as shadows on a wall,"
1728,VIII.,"As silent still, as dark as they,"
1729,VIII.,"Before that stranger, bent and gray,"
1730,VIII.,"The youth stood scornful, proud, and tall."
1731,VIII.,
1732,VIII.,"He stood, a tall palmetto-tree"
1733,VIII.,With Spanish daggers guarding it;
1734,VIII.,"Nor deed, nor word, to him seemed fit"
1735,VIII.,While she prayed on so silently.
1736,VIII.,
1737,VIII.,He slew his rival with his eyes;
1738,VIII.,"His eyes were daggers piercing deep,--"
1739,VIII.,So deep that blood began to creep
1740,VIII.,From their deep wounds and drop wordwise:
1741,VIII.,
1742,VIII.,"His eyes so black, so bright that they"
1743,VIII.,"Might raise the dead, the living slay,"
1744,VIII.,"If but the dead, the living, bore"
1745,VIII.,Such hearts as heroes had of yore:
1746,VIII.,
1747,VIII.,"Two deadly arrows barbed in black,"
1748,VIII.,"And feathered, too, with raven's wing;"
1749,VIII.,"Two arrows that could silent sting,"
1750,VIII.,And with a death-wound answer back.
1751,VIII.,
1752,VIII.,How fierce he was! how deadly still
1753,VIII.,"In that mesmeric, hateful stare"
1754,VIII.,Turned on the pleading stranger there
1755,VIII.,"That drew to him, despite his will:"
1756,VIII.,
1757,VIII.,"So like a bird down-fluttering,"
1758,VIII.,"Down, down, beneath a snake's bright eyes,"
1759,VIII.,"He stood, a fascinated thing,"
1760,VIII.,"That hopeless, unresisting, dies."
1761,VIII.,
1762,VIII.,"He raised a hard hand as before,"
1763,VIII.,"Reached out the gold, and offered it"
1764,VIII.,"With hand that shook as ague-fit,--"
1765,VIII.,The while the youth but scorned the more.
1766,VIII.,
1767,VIII.,"""You will not touch it? In God's name"
1768,VIII.,"Who are you, and what are you, then?"
1769,VIII.,"Come, take this gold, and be of men,--"
1770,VIII.,A human form with human aim.
1771,VIII.,
1772,VIII.,"""Yea, take this gold,--she must be mine"
1773,VIII.,She shall be mine! I do not fear
1774,VIII.,"Your scowl, your scorn, your soul austere,"
1775,VIII.,"The living, dead, or your dark sign."
1776,VIII.,
1777,VIII.,"""I saw her as she entered there;"
1778,VIII.,"I saw her, and uncovered stood:"
1779,VIII.,The perfume of her womanhood
1780,VIII.,Was holy incense on the air.
1781,VIII.,
1782,VIII.,"""She left behind sweet sanctity,"
1783,VIII.,Religion lay the way she went;
1784,VIII.,"I cried I would repent, repent!"
1785,VIII.,"She passed on, all unheeding me."
1786,VIII.,
1787,VIII.,"""Her soul is young, her eyes are bright"
1788,VIII.,"And gladsome, as mine own are dim;"
1789,VIII.,"But, oh, I felt my senses swim"
1790,VIII.,The time she passed me by to-night!--
1791,VIII.,
1792,VIII.,"""The time she passed, nor raised her eyes"
1793,VIII.,"To hear me cry I would repent,"
1794,VIII.,"Nor turned her head to hear my cries,"
1795,VIII.,"But swifter went the way she went,--"
1796,VIII.,
1797,VIII.,"""Went swift as youth, for all these years!"
1798,VIII.,"And this the strangest thing appears,"
1799,VIII.,"That lady there seems just the same,--"
1800,VIII.,Sweet Gladys-- Ah! you know her name?
1801,VIII.,
1802,VIII.,"""You hear her name and start that I"
1803,VIII.,Should name her dear name trembling so?
1804,VIII.,"Why, boy, when I shall come to die"
1805,VIII.,That name shall be the last I know.
1806,VIII.,
1807,VIII.,"""That name shall be the last sweet name"
1808,VIII.,My lips shall utter in this life!
1809,VIII.,"That name is brighter than bright flame,--"
1810,VIII.,That lady is my wedded wife!
1811,VIII.,
1812,VIII.,"""Ah, start and catch your burning breath!"
1813,VIII.,"Ah, start and clutch your deadly knife!"
1814,VIII.,"If this be death, then be it death,--"
1815,VIII.,But that loved lady is my wife!
1816,VIII.,
1817,VIII.,"""Yea, you are stunned! your face is white,"
1818,VIII.,"That I should come confronting you,"
1819,VIII.,As comes a lorn ghost of the night
1820,VIII.,"From out the past, and to pursue."
1821,VIII.,
1822,VIII.,"""You thought me dead? You shake your head,"
1823,VIII.,You start back horrified to know
1824,VIII.,"That she is loved, that she is wed,"
1825,VIII.,That you have sinned in loving so.
1826,VIII.,
1827,VIII.,"""Yet what seems strange, that lady there,"
1828,VIII.,"Housed in the holy house of prayer,"
1829,VIII.,"Seems just the same for all her tears,--"
1830,VIII.,For all my absent twenty years.
1831,VIII.,
1832,VIII.,"""Yea, twenty years to-night, to-night,"
1833,VIII.,"Just twenty years this day, this hour,"
1834,VIII.,"Since first I plucked that perfect flower,"
1835,VIII.,And not one witness of the rite.
1836,VIII.,
1837,VIII.,"""Nay, do not doubt,--I tell you true!"
1838,VIII.,"Her prayers, her tears, her constancy"
1839,VIII.,"Are all for me, are all for me,--"
1840,VIII.,And not one single thought for you!
1841,VIII.,
1842,VIII.,"""I knew, I knew she would be here"
1843,VIII.,This night of nights to pray for me!
1844,VIII.,And how could I for twenty year
1845,VIII.,Know this same night so certainly?
1846,VIII.,
1847,VIII.,"""Ah me! some thoughts that we would drown"
1848,VIII.,Stick closer than a brother to
1849,VIII.,"The conscience, and pursue, pursue"
1850,VIII.,Like baying hound to hunt us down.
1851,VIII.,
1852,VIII.,"""And then, that date is history;"
1853,VIII.,"For on that night this shore was shelled,"
1854,VIII.,"And many a noble mansion felled,"
1855,VIII.,With many a noble family.
1856,VIII.,
1857,VIII.,"""I wore the blue; I watched the flight"
1858,VIII.,Of shells like stars tossed through the air
1859,VIII.,"To blow your hearth-stones--anywhere,"
1860,VIII.,"That wild, illuminated night."
1861,VIII.,
1862,VIII.,"""Nay, rage befits you not so well:"
1863,VIII.,"Why, you were but a babe at best,"
1864,VIII.,Your cradle some sharp bursted shell
1865,VIII.,"That tore, maybe, your mother's breast!"
1866,VIII.,
1867,VIII.,"""Hear me! We came in honored war."
1868,VIII.,The risen world was on your track!
1869,VIII.,"The whole North-land was at our back,"
1870,VIII.,From Hudson's bank to the North star!
1871,VIII.,
1872,VIII.,"""And from the North to palm-set sea"
1873,VIII.,The splendid fiery cyclone swept.
1874,VIII.,"Your fathers fell, your mothers wept,"
1875,VIII.,Their nude babes clinging to the knee.
1876,VIII.,
1877,VIII.,"""A wide and desolated track:"
1878,VIII.,"Behind, a path of ruin lay;"
1879,VIII.,"Before, some women by the way"
1880,VIII.,"Stood mutely gazing, clad in black."
1881,VIII.,
1882,VIII.,"""From silent women waiting there"
1883,VIII.,Some tears came down like still small rain;
1884,VIII.,Their own sons on the battle plain
1885,VIII.,Were now but viewless ghosts of air.
1886,VIII.,
1887,VIII.,"""Their own dear daring boys in gray,--"
1888,VIII.,They should not see them any more;
1889,VIII.,Our cruel drums kept telling o'er
1890,VIII.,The time their own sons went away.
1891,VIII.,
1892,VIII.,"""Through burning town, by bursting shell--"
1893,VIII.,"Yea, I remember well that night;"
1894,VIII.,"I led through orange-lanes of light,"
1895,VIII.,As through some hot outpost of hell!
1896,VIII.,
1897,VIII.,"""That night of rainbow-shot and shell"
1898,VIII.,Sent from your surging river's breast
1899,VIII.,"To waken me, no more to rest,--"
1900,VIII.,That night I should remember well!
1901,VIII.,
1902,VIII.,"""That night amid the maimed and dead,--"
1903,VIII.,A night in history set down
1904,VIII.,"By light of many a burning town,"
1905,VIII.,"And written all across in red,--"
1906,VIII.,
1907,VIII.,"""Her father dead, her brothers dead,"
1908,VIII.,"Her home in flames,--what else could she"
1909,VIII.,"But fly all helpless here to me,"
1910,VIII.,"A fluttered dove, that night of dread?"
1911,VIII.,
1912,VIII.,"""Short time, hot time had I to woo"
1913,VIII.,Amid the red shells' battle-chime;
1914,VIII.,"But women rarely reckon time,"
1915,VIII.,And perils speed their love when true.
1916,VIII.,
1917,VIII.,"""And then I wore a captain's sword;"
1918,VIII.,"And, too, had oftentime before"
1919,VIII.,"Doffed cap at her dead father's door,"
1920,VIII.,And passed a soldier's pleasant word.
1921,VIII.,
1922,VIII.,"""And then--ah, I was comely then!"
1923,VIII.,"I bore no load upon my back,"
1924,VIII.,"I heard no hounds upon my track,"
1925,VIII.,But stood the tallest of tall men.
1926,VIII.,
1927,VIII.,"""Her father's and her mother's shrine,"
1928,VIII.,"This church amid the orange wood,"
1929,VIII.,"So near and so secure it stood,"
1930,VIII.,It seemed to beckon as a sign.
1931,VIII.,
1932,VIII.,"""Its white cross seemed to beckon me:"
1933,VIII.,"My heart was strong, and it was mine"
1934,VIII.,"To throw myself upon my knee,"
1935,VIII.,To beg to lead her to this shrine.
1936,VIII.,
1937,VIII.,"""She did consent. Through lanes of light"
1938,VIII.,I led through that church-door that night--
1939,VIII.,Let fall your hand! Take back your face
1940,VIII.,"And stand,--stand patient in your place!"
1941,VIII.,
1942,VIII.,"""She loved me; and she loves me still."
1943,VIII.,"Yea, she clung close to me that hour"
1944,VIII.,"As honey-bee to honey-flower,--"
1945,VIII.,"And still is mine, through good or ill."
1946,VIII.,
1947,VIII.,"""The priest stood there. He spake the prayer;"
1948,VIII.,"He made the holy, mystic sign."
1949,VIII.,"And she was mine, was wholly mine,--"
1950,VIII.,Is mine this moment I will swear!
1951,VIII.,
1952,VIII.,"""Then days, then nights, of vast delight,--"
1953,VIII.,"Then came a doubtful, later day;"
1954,VIII.,"The faithful priest, now far away,"
1955,VIII.,Watched with the dying in the fight:

2032,VIII.,"""Now I had gold! two bags of gold!"

2037,VIII.,"""My country's lesson: 'Gold! get gold!'"

2052,VIII.,"""I feared! I feared! My heart grew cold,--"
2053,VIII.,Some one might claim this gold of me!

2072,VIII.,"""And when I sudden turned to go,"

2076,VIII.,
2077,VIII.,"""And that was all; her splendid face"

2080,VIII.,As she fell moaning in her place.
2081,VIII.,
2082,VIII.,"""And there, 'mid her dark night of hair,"

2086,VIII.,
2087,VIII.,"""Nay, did not murmur, not deny,--"

2435,III.,The garnered grain each harvest-time
2436,III.,"Hath promise, roundness, and full prime"
2437,III.,For all the empty chaff and sheaf.
2438,III.,
2439,III.,Believe in man with proud belief:
2440,III.,"Truth keeps the bottom of her well,"
2441,III.,"And when the thief peeps down, the thief"
2442,III.,"Peeps back at him, perpetual."
2443,III.,
2444,III.,Faint not that this or that man fell;
2445,III.,For one that falls a thousand rise
2446,III.,To lift white Progress to the skies:
2447,III.,Truth keeps the bottom of her well.
2448,III.,
2449,III.,"Fear not for man, nor cease to delve"
2450,III.,"For cool sweet truth, with large belief."
2451,III.,"Lo! Christ himself chose only twelve,"
2452,III.,Yet one of these turned out a thief.
2453,III.,
2454,III.,
2455,IV.,IV.
2456,IV.,
2457,IV.,Down through the dark magnolia leaves
2458,IV.,Where climbs the rose of Cherokee
2459,IV.,"Against the orange-blossomed tree,"
2460,IV.,"A loom of moonlight weaves and weaves,--"
2461,IV.,
2462,IV.,"A loom of moonlight, weaving clothes"
2463,IV.,"From snow-white rose of Cherokee,"
2464,IV.,"And bridal blooms of orange-tree,"
2465,IV.,For fairy folk in fragrant rose.
2466,IV.,
2467,IV.,"Down through the mournful myrtle crape,"
2468,IV.,"Through moving moss, through ghostly gloom,"
2469,IV.,A long white moonbeam takes a shape
2470,IV.,"Above a nameless, lowly tomb;"
2471,IV.,
2472,IV.,A long white finger through the gloom
2473,IV.,"Of grasses gathered round about,--"
2474,IV.,As God's white finger pointing out
2475,IV.,A name upon that nameless tomb.
2476,IV.,
2477,IV.,
2478,V.,V.
2479,V.,
2480,V.,"Her white face bowed in her black hair,"
2481,V.,The maiden prays so still within
2482,V.,"That you might hear a falling pin,--"
2483,V.,"Ay, hear her white unuttered prayer."
2484,V.,
2485,V.,"The moon has grown disconsolate,"
2486,V.,Has turned her down her walk of stars:
2487,V.,"Why, she is shutting up her bars,"
2488,V.,As maidens shut a lover's gate.
2489,V.,
2490,V.,The moon has grown disconsolate;
2491,V.,She will no longer watch and wait.
2492,V.,But two men wait; and two men will
2493,V.,"Wait on till morning, mute and still:"
2494,V.,
2495,V.,"Still wait and walk among the trees,"
2496,V.,Quite careless if the moon may keep
2497,V.,Her walk along her starry steep
2498,V.,Above the Southern pearl-sown seas.
2499,V.,
2500,V.,"They know no moon, or set or rise"
2501,V.,"Of stars, or anything to light"
2502,V.,"The earth or skies, save her dark eyes,"
2503,V.,"This praying, waking, watching night."
2504,V.,
2505,V.,"They move among the tombs apart,"
2506,V.,Their eyes turn ever to that door;
2507,V.,They know the worn walks there by heart--
2508,V.,They turn and walk them o'er and o'er.
2509,V.,
2510,V.,"They are not wide, these little walks"
2511,V.,For dead folk by this crescent town.
2512,V.,"They lie right close when they lie down,"
2513,V.,As if they kept up quiet talks.
2514,V.,
2515,V.,
2516,VI.,VI.
2517,VI.,
2518,VI.,The two men keep their paths apart;
2519,VI.,But more and more begins to stoop
2520,VI.,"The man with gold, as droop and droop"
2521,VI.,Tall plants with something at their heart.
2522,VI.,
2523,VI.,Now once again with eager zest
2524,VI.,He offers gold with silent speech;
2525,VI.,"The other will not walk in reach,"
2526,VI.,"But walks around, as round a pest."
2527,VI.,
2528,VI.,"His dark eyes sweep the scene around,"
2529,VI.,"His young face drinks the fragrant air,"
2530,VI.,"His dark eyes journey everywhere,--"
2531,VI.,The other's cleave unto the ground.
2532,VI.,
2533,VI.,"It is a weary walk for him,"
2534,VI.,For oh he bears a weary load!
2535,VI.,He does not like that narrow road
2536,VI.,Between the dead--it is so dim:
2537,VI.,
2538,VI.,"It is so dark, that narrow place,"
2539,VI.,"Where graves lie thick, like yellow leaves:"
2540,VI.,"Give us the light of Christ and grace,"
2541,VI.,Give light to garner in the sheaves.
2542,VI.,
2543,VI.,"Give light of love; for gold is cold,"
2544,VI.,And gold is cruel as a crime;
2545,VI.,It gives no light at such sad time
2546,VI.,As when man's feet wax weak and old.
2547,VI.,
2548,VI.,"Ay, gold is heavy, hard, and cold!"
2549,VI.,And have I said this thing before?
2550,VI.,"Well, I will tell it o'er and o'er,"
2551,VI.,'Twere need be told ten thousand fold.
2552,VI.,
2553,VI.,"""Give us this day our daily bread,""--"
2554,VI.,"Get this of God, then all the rest"
2555,VI.,"Is housed in thine own honest breast,"
2556,VI.,If you but lift a lordly head.
2557,VI.,
2558,VI.,
2559,VII.,VII.
2560,VII.,
2561,VII.,"Oh, I have seen men, tall and fair,"
2562,VII.,"Stoop down their manhood with disgust,"
2563,VII.,"Stoop down God's image to the dust,"
2564,VII.,To get a load of gold to bear;
2565,VII.,
2566,VII.,Have seen men selling day by day
2567,VII.,The glance of manhood that God gave:
2568,VII.,To sell God's image as a slave
2569,VII.,Might sell some little pot of clay!
2570,VII.,
2571,VII.,Behold! here in this green graveyard
2572,VII.,A man with gold enough to fill
2573,VII.,"A coffin, as a miller's till;"
2574,VII.,"And yet his path is hard, so hard!"
2575,VII.,
2576,VII.,"His feet keep sinking in the sand,"
2577,VII.,And now so near an opened grave!
2578,VII.,He seems to hear the solemn wave
2579,VII.,Of dread oblivion at hand.
2580,VII.,
2581,VII.,"The sands, they grumble so, it seems"
2582,VII.,As if he walks some shelving brink.
2583,VII.,"He tries to stop, he tries to think,"
2584,VII.,He tries to make believe he dreams:
2585,VII.,
2586,VII.,"Why, he is free to leave the land,"
2587,VII.,The silver moon is white as dawn;
2588,VII.,"Why, he has gold in either hand,"
2589,VII.,Has silver ways to walk upon.
2590,VII.,
2591,VII.,"And who should chide, or bid him stay?"
2592,VII.,"Or taunt, or threat, or bid him fly?"
2593,VII.,"The world's for sale, I hear men say,"
2594,VII.,And yet this man has gold to buy.
2595,VII.,
2596,VII.,Buy what? Buy rest? He could not rest!
2597,VII.,"Buy gentle sleep? He could not sleep,"
2598,VII.,Though all these graves were wide and deep
2599,VII.,As their wide mouths with the request.
2600,VII.,
2601,VII.,"Buy Love, buy faith, buy snow-white truth?"
2602,VII.,"Buy moonlight, sunlight, present, past?"
2603,VII.,Buy but one brimful cup of youth
2604,VII.,That calm souls drink of to the last?
2605,VII.,
2606,VII.,O God! 'tis pitiful to see
2607,VII.,This miser so forlorn and old!
2608,VII.,O God! how poor a man may be
2609,VII.,With nothing in this world but gold!
2610,VII.,
2611,VII.,
2612,VIII.,VIII.
2613,VIII.,
2614,VIII.,The broad magnolia's blooms are white;
2615,VIII.,"Her blooms are large, as if the moon"
2616,VIII.,"Had lost her way some lazy night,"
2617,VIII.,And lodged here till the afternoon.
2618,VIII.,
2619,VIII.,"Oh, vast white blossoms breathing love!"
2620,VIII.,"White bosom of my lady dead,"
2621,VIII.,In your white heaven overhead
2622,VIII.,"I look, and learn to look above."
2623,VIII.,
2624,VIII.,
2625,IX.,IX.
2626,IX.,
2627,IX.,All night the tall magnolia kept
2628,IX.,Kind watch above the nameless tomb:
2629,IX.,Two shapes kept waiting in the gloom
2630,IX.,"And gray of morn, where roses wept."
2631,IX.,
2632,IX.,The dew-wet roses wept; their eyes
2633,IX.,"All dew, their breath as sweet as prayer."
2634,IX.,"And as they wept, the dead down there"
2635,IX.,Did feel their tears and hear their sighs.
2636,IX.,
2637,IX.,The grass uprose as if afraid
2638,IX.,Some stranger foot might press too near;
2639,IX.,"Its every blade was like a spear,"
2640,IX.,Its every spear a living blade.
2641,IX.,
2642,IX.,The grass above that nameless tomb
2643,IX.,"Stood all arrayed, as if afraid"
2644,IX.,Some weary pilgrim seeking room
2645,IX.,"And rest, might lay where she was laid."
2646,IX.,
2647,IX.,
2648,X.,X.
2649,X.,
2650,X.,"'Twas morn, and yet it was not morn;"
2651,X.,"'Twas morn in heaven, not on earth,--"
2652,X.,"A star was singing of a birth,"
2653,X.,Just saying that a day was born.
2654,X.,
2655,X.,"The marsh hard by that bound the lake,--"
2656,X.,"The great low sea-lake, Ponchartrain,"
2657,X.,"Shut off from sultry Cuban main,--"
2658,X.,"Drew up its legs, as half awake:"
2659,X.,
2660,X.,"Drew long stork legs, long legs that steep"
2661,X.,"In slime where alligators creep,--"
2662,X.,"Drew long green legs that stir the grass,"
2663,X.,As when the late lorn night-winds pass.
2664,X.,
2665,X.,"Then from the marsh came croakings low,"
2666,X.,Then louder croaked some sea-marsh beast;
2667,X.,"Then, far away against the east,"
2668,X.,God's rose of morn began to grow.
2669,X.,
2670,X.,"From out the marsh, against that east,"
2671,X.,A ghostly moss-swept cypress stood;
2672,X.,With ragged arms above the wood
2673,X.,"It rose, a God-forsaken beast."
2674,X.,
2675,X.,It seemed so frightened where it rose!
2676,X.,The moss-hung thing it seemed to wave
2677,X.,"The worn-out garments of the grave,--"
2678,X.,To wave and wave its old grave-clothes.
2679,X.,
2680,X.,"Close by, a cow rose up and lowed"
2681,X.,From out a palm-thatched milking-shed.
2682,X.,A black boy on the river road
2683,X.,"Fled sudden, as the night had fled:"
2684,X.,
2685,X.,"A nude black boy, a bit of night"
2686,X.,That had been broken off and lost
2687,X.,"From flying night, the time it crossed"
2688,X.,The surging river in its flight:
2689,X.,
2690,X.,"A bit of darkness, following"
2691,X.,"The sable night on sable wing,--"
2692,X.,"A bit of darkness stilled with fear,"
2693,X.,Because that nameless tomb was near.
2694,X.,
2695,X.,Then holy bells came pealing out;
2696,X.,"Then steamboats blew, then horses neighed;"
2697,X.,Then smoke from hamlets round about
2698,X.,"Crept out, as if no more afraid."
2699,X.,
2700,X.,"Then shrill cocks here, and shrill cocks there,"
2701,X.,Stretched glossy necks and filled the air.
2702,X.,How many cocks it takes to make
2703,X.,A country morning well awake!
2704,X.,
2705,X.,"Then many boughs, with many birds,--"
2706,X.,"Young boughs in green, old boughs in gray,--"
2707,X.,These birds had very much to say
2708,X.,"In their soft, sweet, familiar words."
2709,X.,
2710,X.,And all seemed sudden glad; the gloom
2711,X.,"Forgot the church, forgot the tomb;"
2712,X.,And yet like monks with cross and bead
2713,X.,The myrtles leaned to read and read.
2714,X.,
2715,X.,And oh the fragrance of the sod!
2716,X.,And oh the perfume of the air!
2717,X.,"The sweetness, sweetness everywhere,"
2718,X.,That rose like incense up to God!
2719,X.,
2720,X.,"I like a cow's breath in sweet spring,"
2721,X.,I like the breath of babes new-born;
2722,X.,"A maid's breath is a pleasant thing,--"
2723,X.,But oh the breath of sudden morn!
2724,X.,
2725,X.,"Of sudden morn, when every pore"
2726,X.,Of mother earth is pulsing fast
2727,X.,"With life, and life seems spilling o'er"
2728,X.,"With love, with love too sweet to last:"
2729,X.,
2730,X.,"Of sudden morn beneath the sun,"
2731,X.,"By God's great river wrapped in gray,"
2732,X.,"That for a space forgets to run,"
2733,X.,And hides his face as if to pray.
2734,X.,
2735,X.,
2736,XI.,XI.
2737,XI.,
2738,XI.,The black-eyed Creole kept his eyes
2739,XI.,"Turned to the door, as eyes might turn"
2740,XI.,To see the holy embers burn
2741,XI.,Some sin away at sacrifice.
2742,XI.,
2743,XI.,"Full dawn! but yet he knew no dawn,"
2744,XI.,"Nor song of bird, nor bird on wing,"
2745,XI.,"Nor breath of rose, nor anything"
2746,XI.,Her fair face lifted not upon.
2747,XI.,
2748,XI.,And yet he taller stood with morn;
2749,XI.,"His bright eyes, brighter than before,"
2750,XI.,"Burned fast against that fastened door,"
2751,XI.,"His proud lips lifting up with scorn,--"
2752,XI.,
2753,XI.,"With lofty, silent scorn for one"
2754,XI.,"Who all night long had plead and plead,"
2755,XI.,With none to witness but the dead
2756,XI.,How he for gold must be undone.
2757,XI.,
2758,XI.,"Oh, ye who feed a greed for gold,"
2759,XI.,"And barter truth, and trade sweet youth"
2760,XI.,"For cold hard gold, behold, behold!"
2761,XI.,Behold this man! behold this truth!
2762,XI.,
2763,XI.,"Why, what is there in all God's plan"
2764,XI.,"Of vast creation, high or low,"
2765,XI.,"By sea or land, by sun or snow,"
2766,XI.,"So mean, so miserly as man?"
2767,XI.,
2768,XI.,"Lo, earth and heaven all let go"
2769,XI.,"Their garnered riches, year by year!"
2770,XI.,"The treasures of the trackless snow,"
2771,XI.,"Ah, hast thou seen how very dear?"
2772,XI.,
2773,XI.,"The wide earth gives, gives golden grain,"
2774,XI.,"Gives fruits of gold, gives all, gives all!"
2775,XI.,"Hold forth your hand, and these shall fall"
2776,XI.,In your full palm as free as rain.
2777,XI.,
2778,XI.,"Yea, earth is generous. The trees"
2779,XI.,"Strip nude as birth-time without fear,"
2780,XI.,And their reward is year by year
2781,XI.,To feel their fulness but increase.
2782,XI.,
2783,XI.,"The law of Nature is to give,"
2784,XI.,"To give, to give! and to rejoice"
2785,XI.,"In giving with a generous voice,"
2786,XI.,And so trust God and truly live.
2787,XI.,
2788,XI.,"But see this miser at the last,--"
2789,XI.,"This man who loves, grasps hold of gold,"
2790,XI.,"Who grasps it with such eager hold,"
2791,XI.,To hold forever hard and fast:
2792,XI.,
2793,XI.,As if to hold what God lets go;
2794,XI.,"As if to hold, while all around"
2795,XI.,"Lets go, and drops upon the ground"
2796,XI.,All things as generous as snow.
2797,XI.,
2798,XI.,"Let go your greedy hold, I say!"
2799,XI.,Let go your hold! Do not refuse
2800,XI.,"'Till death comes by and shakes you loose,"
2801,XI.,And sends you shamed upon your way.
2802,XI.,
2803,XI.,What if the sun should keep his gold?
2804,XI.,The rich moon lock her silver up?
2805,XI.,What if the gold-clad buttercup
2806,XI.,"Became a miser, mean and old?"
2807,XI.,
2808,XI.,"Ah, me! the coffins are so true"
2809,XI.,"In all accounts, the shrouds so thin,"
2810,XI.,"That down there you might sew and sew,"
2811,XI.,Nor ever sew one pocket in.
2812,XI.,
2813,XI.,And all that you can hold of lands
2814,XI.,"Down there, below the grass, down there,"
2815,XI.,Will only be that little share
2816,XI.,You hold in your two dust-full hands.
2817,XI.,
2818,XI.,
2819,XII.,XII.
2820,XII.,
2821,XII.,She comes! she comes! The stony floor
2822,XII.,Speaks out! And now the rusty door
2823,XII.,"At last has just one word this day,"
2824,XII.,"With mute religious lips, to say."
2825,XII.,
2826,XII.,"She comes! she comes! And lo, her face"
2827,XII.,"Is upward, radiant, fair as prayer!"
2828,XII.,"So pure here in this holy place,"
2829,XII.,Where holy peace is everywhere.
2830,XII.,
2831,XII.,"Her upraised face, her face of light"
2832,XII.,"And loveliness, from duty done,"
2833,XII.,Is like a rising orient sun
2834,XII.,That pushes back the brow of night.
2835,XII.,
2836,XII.,"How brave, how beautiful is truth!"
2837,XII.,Good deeds untold are like to this.
2838,XII.,But fairest of all fair things is
2839,XII.,A pious maiden in her youth:
2840,XII.,
2841,XII.,A pious maiden as she stands
2842,XII.,Just on the threshold of the years
2843,XII.,"That throb and pulse with hopes and fears,"
2844,XII.,And reaches God her helpless hands.
2845,XII.,
2846,XII.,How fair is she! How fond is she!
2847,XII.,Her foot upon the threshold there.
2848,XII.,"Her breath is as a blossomed tree,--"
2849,XII.,This maiden mantled in her hair!
2850,XII.,
2851,XII.,"Her hair, her black, abundant hair,"
2852,XII.,"Where night, inhabited all night"
2853,XII.,"And all this day, will not take flight,"
2854,XII.,But finds content and houses there.
2855,XII.,
2856,XII.,"Her hands are clasped, her two small hands;"
2857,XII.,They hold the holy book of prayer
2858,XII.,"Just as she steps the threshold there,"
2859,XII.,Clasped downward where she silent stands.
2860,XII.,
2861,XII.,
2862,XIII.,XIII.
2863,XIII.,
2864,XIII.,"Once more she lifts her lowly face,"
2865,XIII.,"And slowly lifts her large, dark eyes"
2866,XIII.,Of wonder; and in still surprise
2867,XIII.,She looks full forward in her place.
2868,XIII.,
2869,XIII.,She looks full forward on the air
2870,XIII.,"Above the tomb, and yet below"
2871,XIII.,"The fruits of gold, the blooms of snow,"
2872,XIII.,As looking--looking anywhere.
2873,XIII.,
2874,XIII.,She feels--she knows not what she feels;
2875,XIII.,"It is not terror, is not fear,"
2876,XIII.,But there is something that reveals
2877,XIII.,A presence that is near and dear.
2878,XIII.,
2879,XIII.,"She does not let her eyes fall down,"
2880,XIII.,They lift against the far profound:
2881,XIII.,Against the blue above the town
2882,XIII.,Two wide-winged vultures circle round.
2883,XIII.,
2884,XIII.,"Two brown birds swim above the sea,--"
2885,XIII.,Her large eyes swim as dreamily
2886,XIII.,"And follow far, and follow high,"
2887,XIII.,Two circling black specks in the sky.
2888,XIII.,
2889,XIII.,"One forward step,--the closing door"
2890,XIII.,"Creaks out, as frightened or in pain;"
2891,XIII.,Her eyes are on the ground again--
2892,XIII.,Two men are standing close before.
2893,XIII.,
2894,XIII.,"""My love,"" sighs one, ""my life, my all!"""
2895,XIII.,Her lifted foot across the sill
2896,XIII.,"Sinks down,--and all things are so still"
2897,XIII.,You hear the orange blossoms fall.
2898,XIII.,
2899,XIII.,"But fear comes not where duty is,"
2900,XIII.,And purity is peace and rest;
2901,XIII.,"Her cross is close upon her breast,"
2902,XIII.,Her two hands clasp hard hold of this.
2903,XIII.,
2904,XIII.,"Her two hands clasp cross, book, and she"
2905,XIII.,"Is strong in tranquil purity,--"
2906,XIII.,"Ay, strong as Samson when he laid"
2907,XIII.,"His two hands forth, and bowed and prayed."
2908,XIII.,
2909,XIII.,"One at her left, one at her right,"
2910,XIII.,"And she between, the steps upon,--"
2911,XIII.,"I can but see that Syrian night,"
2912,XIII.,The women there at early dawn
2913,XIII.,
2914,XIII.,"'Tis strange, I know, and may be wrong,"
2915,XIII.,But ever pictured in my song;
2916,XIII.,"And rhyming on, I see the day"
2917,XIII.,They came to roll the stone away.
2918,XIII.,
2919,XIII.,
2920,XIV.,XIV.
2921,XIV.,
2922,XIV.,"The sky is like an opal sea,"
2923,XIV.,"The air is like the breath of kine,"
2924,XIV.,"But oh her face is white, and she"
2925,XIV.,"Leans faint to see a lifted sign,--"
2926,XIV.,
2927,XIV.,To see two hands lift up and wave
2928,XIV.,"To see a face so white with woe,"
2929,XIV.,"So ghastly, hollow, white as though"
2930,XIV.,It had that moment left the grave.
2931,XIV.,
2932,XIV.,"Her sweet face at that ghostly sign,"
2933,XIV.,"Her fair face in her weight of hair,"
2934,XIV.,"Is like a white dove drowning there,--"
2935,XIV.,A white dove drowned in Tuscan wine.
2936,XIV.,
2937,XIV.,"He tries to stand, to stand erect."
2938,XIV.,"'Tis gold, 'tis gold that holds him down!"
2939,XIV.,"And soul and body both must drown,--"
2940,XIV.,Two millstones tied about his neck.
2941,XIV.,
2942,XIV.,Now once again his piteous face
2943,XIV.,Is raised to her face reaching there.
2944,XIV.,"He prays such piteous, silent prayer"
2945,XIV.,As prays a dying man for grace.
2946,XIV.,
2947,XIV.,It is not good to see him strain
2948,XIV.,"To lift his hands, to gasp, to try"
2949,XIV.,To speak. His parched lips are so dry
2950,XIV.,Their sight is as a living pain.
2951,XIV.,
2952,XIV.,I think that rich man down in hell
2953,XIV.,"Some like this old man with his gold,--"
2954,XIV.,To gasp and gasp perpetual
2955,XIV.,Like to this minute I have told.
2956,XIV.,
2957,XIV.,
2958,XV.,XV.
2959,XV.,
2960,XV.,"At last the miser cries his pain,--"
2961,XV.,"A shrill, wild cry, as if a grave"
2962,XV.,Just ope'd its stony lips and gave
2963,XV.,"One sentence forth, then closed again."
2964,XV.,
2965,XV.,"""'Twas twenty years last night, last night!"""
2966,XV.,"His lips still moved, but not to speak;"
2967,XV.,His outstretched hands so trembling weak
2968,XV.,Were beggar's hands in sorry plight.
2969,XV.,
2970,XV.,"His face upturned to hers, his lips"
2971,XV.,"Kept talking on, but gave no sound;"
2972,XV.,His feet were cloven to the ground;
2973,XV.,Like iron hooks his finger-tips.
2974,XV.,
2975,XV.,"""Ay, twenty years,"" she sadly sighed:"
2976,XV.,"""I promised mother every year"
2977,XV.,"That I would pray for father here,"
2978,XV.,"As she had prayed, the night she died:"
2979,XV.,
2980,XV.,"""To pray as she prayed, fervidly;"
2981,XV.,As she had promised she would pray
2982,XV.,"The sad night of her marriage day,"
2983,XV.,"For him, wherever he might be."""
2984,XV.,
2985,XV.,Then she was still; then sudden she
2986,XV.,"Let fall her eyes, and so outspake"
2987,XV.,"As if her very heart would break,"
2988,XV.,Her proud lips trembling piteously:
2989,XV.,
2990,XV.,"""And whether he come soon or late"
2991,XV.,"To kneel beside this nameless grave,"
2992,XV.,May God forgive my father's hate
2993,XV.,"As I forgive, as she forgave!"""
2994,XV.,
2995,XV.,He saw the stone; he understood
2996,XV.,With that quick knowledge that will come
2997,XV.,Most quick when men are made most dumb
2998,XV.,With terror that stops still the blood.
2999,XV.,
3000,XV.,And then a blindness slowly fell
3001,XV.,On soul and body; but his hands
3002,XV.,"Held tight his bags, two iron bands,"
3003,XV.,As if to bear them into hell.
3004,XV.,
3005,XV.,He sank upon the nameless stone
3006,XV.,"With oh such sad, such piteous moan"
3007,XV.,As never man might seek to know
3008,XV.,From man's most unforgiving foe.
3009,XV.,
3010,XV.,"He sighed at last, so long, so deep,"
3011,XV.,"As one heart breaking in one's sleep,--"
3012,XV.,"One long, last, weary, willing sigh,"
3013,XV.,As if it were a grace to die.
3014,XV.,
3015,XV.,"And then his hands, like loosened bands,"
3016,XV.,"Hung down, hung down on either side;"
3017,XV.,His hands hung down and opened wide:
3018,XV.,He rested in the orange lands.
