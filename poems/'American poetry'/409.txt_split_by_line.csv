102,P R E F A C E.,
103,P R E F A C E.,THE following POEMS were written originally for the Amusement of the
104,P R E F A C E.,"Author, as they were the Products of her leisure Moments.  She had no"
105,P R E F A C E.,Intention ever to have published them; nor would they now have made
106,P R E F A C E.,"their Appearance, but at the Importunity of many of her best, and most"
107,P R E F A C E.,"generous Friends; to whom she considers herself, as under the greatest"
108,P R E F A C E.,Obligations.
109,P R E F A C E.,
110,P R E F A C E.,"As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World, it is hoped the"
111,P R E F A C E.,Critic will not severely censure their Defects; and we presume they
112,P R E F A C E.,"have too much Merit to be cast aside with Contempt, as worthless and"
113,P R E F A C E.,trifling Effusions.
114,P R E F A C E.,
115,P R E F A C E.,"As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under, with Regard to Learning,"
116,P R E F A C E.,"nothing needs to be offered, as her Master's Letter in the following"
117,P R E F A C E.,Page will sufficiently show the Difficulties in this Respect she had to
118,P R E F A C E.,encounter.
119,P R E F A C E.,
120,P R E F A C E.,"With all their Imperfections, the Poems are now humbly submitted to the"
121,P R E F A C E.,Perusal of the Public.

125,P R E F A C E.,The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the Author's Master to the
126,P R E F A C E.,Publisher.
127,P R E F A C E.,
128,P R E F A C E.,"PHILLIS was brought from Africa to America, in the Year 1761, between"
129,P R E F A C E.,seven and eight Years of Age.  Without any Assistance from School
130,P R E F A C E.,"Education, and by only what she was taught in the Family, she, in"
131,P R E F A C E.,"sixteen Months Time from her Arrival, attained the English language,"
132,P R E F A C E.,"to which she was an utter Stranger before, to such a degree, as to"
133,P R E F A C E.,"read any, the most difficult Parts of the Sacred Writings, to the"
134,P R E F A C E.,great Astonishment of all who heard her.
135,P R E F A C E.,
136,P R E F A C E.,"As to her WRITING, her own Curiosity led her to it; and this she learnt"
137,P R E F A C E.,"in so short a Time, that in the Year 1765, she wrote a Letter to the"
138,P R E F A C E.,"Rev. Mr. OCCOM, the Indian Minister, while in England."
139,P R E F A C E.,
140,P R E F A C E.,"She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue, and has made some"
141,P R E F A C E.,"Progress in it.  This Relation is given by her Master who bought her,"
142,P R E F A C E.,and with whom she now lives.

153,JOHN WHEATLEY.,"AS it has been repeatedly suggested to the Publisher, by Persons, who"

163,JOHN WHEATLEY.,"now is, under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in"

205,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"Read o'er what poets sung, and shepherds play'd."
206,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,What felt those poets but you feel the same?
207,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,Does not your soul possess the sacred flame?
208,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,Their noble strains your equal genius shares
209,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"In softer language, and diviner airs."
210,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"While Homer paints, lo! circumfus'd in air,"
211,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,Celestial Gods in mortal forms appear;
212,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"Swift as they move hear each recess rebound,"
213,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"Heav'n quakes, earth trembles, and the shores resound."

215,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"The lightnings blaze across the vaulted skies,"
216,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"And, as the thunder shakes the heav'nly plains,"
217,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,A deep felt horror thrills through all my veins.
218,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"When gentler strains demand thy graceful song,"
219,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,The length'ning line moves languishing along.
220,V A R I O U S  S U B J E C T S.,"When great Patroclus courts Achilles' aid,"
