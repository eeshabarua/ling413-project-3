28,LEMUEL KAYHART,
29,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Oh home, sweet home, my childhood’s home,"
30,LEMUEL KAYHART,"To thee my heart holds near,"
31,LEMUEL KAYHART,"No other place in this wide world,"
32,LEMUEL KAYHART,"To me, is half so dear."
33,LEMUEL KAYHART,
34,LEMUEL KAYHART,"When daisies decked the green clad fields,"
35,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And fragrance filled the air,"
36,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I loved to roam the shady dell,"
37,LEMUEL KAYHART,And never dreamed of care!
38,LEMUEL KAYHART,
39,LEMUEL KAYHART,And when I’d lay my weary head
40,LEMUEL KAYHART,"On mother’s loving breast,"
41,LEMUEL KAYHART,"No mortal danger could I fear,"
42,LEMUEL KAYHART,While there I’d calmly rest.
43,LEMUEL KAYHART,
44,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And when the twilight hours came,"
45,LEMUEL KAYHART,"The stars began to peep,—"
46,LEMUEL KAYHART,She’d take me to my little couch
47,LEMUEL KAYHART,And lay me down to sleep.
48,LEMUEL KAYHART,
49,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And in the morning, when I’d wake,"
50,LEMUEL KAYHART,Oh what heavenly bliss!
51,LEMUEL KAYHART,"She’d take me in her loving arms,"
52,LEMUEL KAYHART,And greet me with a kiss.
53,LEMUEL KAYHART,
54,LEMUEL KAYHART,"But now old age is coming on,"
55,LEMUEL KAYHART,"These locks are turning gray,—"
56,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Like millions passed and gone, I feel"
57,LEMUEL KAYHART,I’m passing fast away.
58,LEMUEL KAYHART,
59,LEMUEL KAYHART,Oh that I were a child again
60,LEMUEL KAYHART,To lean on mother’s breast;
61,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Free from trouble, care and strife"
62,LEMUEL KAYHART,This weary form might rest.
63,LEMUEL KAYHART,
64,LEMUEL KAYHART,"When earth and friends I bid adieu,"
65,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Yon golden streets to roam,—"
66,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I may forget,—but not till then,"
67,MY CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY HOME!,MY CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY HOME!
68,MY CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY HOME!,
69,MY CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY HOME!,
70,MY CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY HOME!,

77,LEMUEL KAYHART,"’Twas man who first came on the earth,"
78,LEMUEL KAYHART,Without a sin or shame;
79,LEMUEL KAYHART,"He knew nothing but joy and mirth,"
80,LEMUEL KAYHART,And Adam was his name.
81,LEMUEL KAYHART,
82,LEMUEL KAYHART,"In Eden’s garden he was placed,"
83,LEMUEL KAYHART,And lovely were the scenes;
84,LEMUEL KAYHART,"All fitted up with God’s own taste,"
85,LEMUEL KAYHART,Among the evergreens.
86,LEMUEL KAYHART,
87,LEMUEL KAYHART,"How happy then he must have been,"
88,LEMUEL KAYHART,From toil and labor free;
89,LEMUEL KAYHART,"From sickness, sorrow, death and sin,—"
90,LEMUEL KAYHART,In Nature’s charming glee!
91,LEMUEL KAYHART,
92,LEMUEL KAYHART,"In God’s own image he was made,"
93,LEMUEL KAYHART,Without a single care;
94,LEMUEL KAYHART,"He never used a hoe nor spade,"
95,LEMUEL KAYHART,’Till woman was put there.
96,LEMUEL KAYHART,
97,LEMUEL KAYHART,"’Twas woman first broke God’s command,"
98,LEMUEL KAYHART,Then tempted man to sin;
99,LEMUEL KAYHART,"’Twas her first brought shame in the land,"
100,LEMUEL KAYHART,And raised this awful din.
101,LEMUEL KAYHART,
102,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Through woman, Christ with grief did mourn,"
103,LEMUEL KAYHART,For her He bled and died;
104,LEMUEL KAYHART,"For her He wore a crown of thorns,"
105,LEMUEL KAYHART,Was hung and crucified.
106,LEMUEL KAYHART,
107,LEMUEL KAYHART,"If Adam had reserved his bone,"
108,LEMUEL KAYHART,’Tis true he’d had no wife;
109,LEMUEL KAYHART,"’Tis better far to live alone,"
110,LEMUEL KAYHART,Than live in war and strife.
111,LEMUEL KAYHART,
112,LEMUEL KAYHART,"But now, you know, since Adam’s time,"
113,LEMUEL KAYHART,"That things are all made new,—"
114,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And now to end my little rhyme,"
115,LEMUEL KAYHART,I’ll call her Kind and True!

122,THE GREEN SHADY WOODS,
123,LEMUEL KAYHART,LEMUEL KAYHART
124,LEMUEL KAYHART,
125,LEMUEL KAYHART,Oh! give me the place where
126,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I roamed when a child,"
127,LEMUEL KAYHART,Where beauty and nature
128,LEMUEL KAYHART,Enchantingly smiled;
129,LEMUEL KAYHART,Where at twilight we heard
130,LEMUEL KAYHART,"The sweet whippoorwill,"
131,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
132,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
133,LEMUEL KAYHART,
134,LEMUEL KAYHART,’Twas there in my childhood
135,LEMUEL KAYHART,I rambled with glee;
136,LEMUEL KAYHART,’Twas there in my youth that
137,LEMUEL KAYHART,I longed so to be;
138,LEMUEL KAYHART,"The place that I loved, with"
139,LEMUEL KAYHART,"A hearty good will,"
140,LEMUEL KAYHART,Was the green shady woods
141,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
142,LEMUEL KAYHART,
143,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I’d go in the morning,"
144,LEMUEL KAYHART,"So happy and free,"
145,LEMUEL KAYHART,And linger till twilight
146,LEMUEL KAYHART,Approaching I’d see;
147,LEMUEL KAYHART,"With brothers, and sisters,"
148,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I played with a will,"
149,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
150,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
151,LEMUEL KAYHART,
152,LEMUEL KAYHART,Where the songs of the birds
153,LEMUEL KAYHART,Re-echo and die;
154,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Where the cool, fresh breezes"
155,LEMUEL KAYHART,So playfully sigh;
156,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Where we listened with joy,"
157,LEMUEL KAYHART,"To the rippling rill,"
158,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
159,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
160,LEMUEL KAYHART,
161,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And there to that clear, cool,"
162,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Crystal spring we’d go,"
163,LEMUEL KAYHART,And down on our knees to
164,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Its fountain bow low,"
165,LEMUEL KAYHART,Like the waters of life
166,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Our souls it would thrill,"
167,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
168,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
169,LEMUEL KAYHART,
170,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I’ve roamed over landscapes,"
171,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Through country and town,"
172,LEMUEL KAYHART,I’ve wandered through cities
173,LEMUEL KAYHART,The streets up and down;
174,LEMUEL KAYHART,"But no place do I find,"
175,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Though quiet and still,"
176,LEMUEL KAYHART,Like the green shady woods
177,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
178,LEMUEL KAYHART,
179,LEMUEL KAYHART,Oh! give me the place where
180,LEMUEL KAYHART,I wantonly strayed;
181,LEMUEL KAYHART,Where in hot summer days
182,LEMUEL KAYHART,My weary head laid;
183,LEMUEL KAYHART,Oh! give me the place where
184,LEMUEL KAYHART,"All’s quiet and still,"
185,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
186,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
187,LEMUEL KAYHART,
188,LEMUEL KAYHART,"And this be my wish,"
189,LEMUEL KAYHART,"In my last fleeting breath,"
190,LEMUEL KAYHART,When this mortal body
191,LEMUEL KAYHART,Is stricken in death:—
192,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Oh! lay me ’neath the turf,"
193,LEMUEL KAYHART,"All quiet and still,"
194,LEMUEL KAYHART,In the green shady woods
195,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.
196,LEMUEL KAYHART,
197,LEMUEL KAYHART,And there though my body
198,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Lies wrapped in green sod,"
199,LEMUEL KAYHART,My spirit will go
200,LEMUEL KAYHART,To the keeping of God;
201,LEMUEL KAYHART,Till Gabriel’s last trumpet
202,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Shall blow loud and shrill,"
203,LEMUEL KAYHART,May I sleep ’neath the woods
204,LEMUEL KAYHART,On the slope of the hill.

363,LEMUEL KAYHART,"There is a land beyond the skies,"

367,LEMUEL KAYHART,
368,LEMUEL KAYHART,"I fain would leave this world of woe,"

371,LEMUEL KAYHART,And reign with Him beyond the skies.
372,LEMUEL KAYHART,
373,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Who made this world, the shining sun,"

375,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Who formed the land, who made the trees,"
376,LEMUEL KAYHART,The mighty oceans and the seas?
377,LEMUEL KAYHART,
378,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Who reared the mountains crowned in green,"

392,LEMUEL KAYHART,
393,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Beautiful land, enchanted land,"
394,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Where angels to me beckoning stand,"

396,LEMUEL KAYHART,To reign with Christ in endless day.
397,LEMUEL KAYHART,
398,LEMUEL KAYHART,"By faith I see that happy land,"
399,LEMUEL KAYHART,The vacant seat at Christ’s right hand;
400,LEMUEL KAYHART,The place that waits me till I rise
401,LEMUEL KAYHART,To reign with Him beyond the skies.
402,LEMUEL KAYHART,
403,LEMUEL KAYHART,"By faith those pearly gates I see,"
404,LEMUEL KAYHART,Those gates stand open wide for me;
405,LEMUEL KAYHART,The angels there in waiting stand
406,LEMUEL KAYHART,To pass me to that happy land.
407,LEMUEL KAYHART,
408,LEMUEL KAYHART,"The dear ones in that happy land,"
409,LEMUEL KAYHART,Methinks I see them hand in hand;
410,LEMUEL KAYHART,"A sister and a darling boy,"
411,LEMUEL KAYHART,And oh! it thrills my soul with joy—
412,LEMUEL KAYHART,
413,LEMUEL KAYHART,"To think of meeting them again,"
414,LEMUEL KAYHART,Beyond this world of care and pain;
415,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Glorious anthems there will rise,"
416,LEMUEL KAYHART,When I get home beyond the skies.
417,LEMUEL KAYHART,
418,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Beautiful land, land of light,"
419,LEMUEL KAYHART,The angels robed in pearly white;
420,LEMUEL KAYHART,"My very soul within me sighs,"
421,LEMUEL KAYHART,To gain that land beyond the skies.
422,LEMUEL KAYHART,
423,LEMUEL KAYHART,"No troubles there will mar our peace,"
424,LEMUEL KAYHART,Our pleasures there will never cease;
425,LEMUEL KAYHART,"No tears of grief will dim our eyes,"
426,LEMUEL KAYHART,In that bright land beyond the skies.
427,LEMUEL KAYHART,
428,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Beautiful land with streets of gold,"
429,LEMUEL KAYHART,Thy splendors half can ne’er be told;
430,LEMUEL KAYHART,When shall my soul to thee arise—
431,LEMUEL KAYHART,Jehovah’s throne beyond the skies.
432,LEMUEL KAYHART,
433,LEMUEL KAYHART,This life is but a troubled dream;
434,LEMUEL KAYHART,When shall I cross cold Jordan’s stream?
435,LEMUEL KAYHART,"Oh! hasten death, my soul replies,"
436,LEMUEL KAYHART,To waft me home beyond the skies.
