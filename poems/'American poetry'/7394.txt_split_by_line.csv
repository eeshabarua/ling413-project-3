219,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,
220,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"As through the forest, disarrayed"
221,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"By chill November, late I strayed,"
222,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,A lonely minstrel of the wood
223,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Was singing to the solitude
224,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"I loved thy music, thus I said,"
225,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,When o'er thy perch the leaves were spread
226,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sweet was thy song, but sweeter now"
227,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Thy carol on the leafless bough.
228,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sing, little bird! thy note shall cheer"
229,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,The sadness of the dying year.
230,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,
231,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,When violets pranked the turf with blue
232,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"And morning filled their cups with dew,"
233,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Thy slender voice with rippling trill
234,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The budding April bowers would fill,"
235,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Nor passed its joyous tones away
236,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,When April rounded into May:
237,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Thy life shall hail no second dawn,--"
238,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sing, little bird! the spring is gone."
239,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,
240,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,And I remember--well-a-day!--
241,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Thy full-blown summer roundelay,"
242,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,As when behind a broidered screen
243,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Some holy maiden sings unseen
244,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"With answering notes the woodland rung,"
245,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,And every tree-top found a tongue.
246,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,How deep the shade! the groves how fair!
247,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sing, little bird! the woods are bare."
248,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,
249,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,The summer's throbbing chant is done
250,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,And mute the choral antiphon;
251,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,The birds have left the shivering pines
252,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"To flit among the trellised vines,"
253,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Or fan the air with scented plumes
254,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Amid the love-sick orange-blooms,"
255,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"And thou art here alone,--alone,--"
256,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sing, little bird! the rest have flown."

258,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The snow has capped yon distant hill,"
259,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"At morn the running brook was still,"
260,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,From driven herds the clouds that rise
261,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Are like the smoke of sacrifice;
262,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,Erelong the frozen sod shall mock
263,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The ploughshare, changed to stubborn rock,"
264,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The brawling streams shall soon be dumb,--"
265,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Sing, little bird! the frosts have come."
266,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,
267,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Fast, fast the lengthening shadows creep,"
268,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The songless fowls are half asleep,"
269,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The air grows chill, the setting sun"
270,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"May leave thee ere thy song is done,"
271,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"The pulse that warms thy breast grow cold,"
272,AN OLD-YEAR SONG,"Thy secret die with thee, untold"

284,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
285,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,I cannot tell the story of Dorothy Q. more simply in prose than I have
286,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"told it in verse, but I can add something to it. Dorothy was the daughter"
287,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"of Judge Edmund Quincy, and the niece of Josiah Quincy, junior, the young"
288,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"patriot and orator who died just before the American Revolution, of which"
289,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,he was one of the most eloquent and effective promoters. The son of the
290,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"latter, Josiah Quincy, the first mayor of Boston bearing that name, lived"
291,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"to a great age, one of the most useful and honored citizens of his time."
292,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,The canvas of the painting was so much decayed that it had to be replaced
293,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"by a new one, in doing which the rapier thrust was of course filled up."
294,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
295,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"GRANDMOTHER'S mother: her age, I guess,"
296,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Thirteen summers, or something less;"
297,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Girlish bust, but womanly air;"
298,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Smooth, square forehead with uprolled hair;"
299,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Lips that lover has never kissed;
300,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Taper fingers and slender wrist;
301,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade;
302,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,So they painted the little maid.
303,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
304,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,On her hand a parrot green
305,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Sits unmoving and broods serene.
306,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Hold up the canvas full in view,--"
307,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Look! there's a rent the light shines through,"
308,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Dark with a century's fringe of dust,--"
309,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,That was a Red-Coat's rapier-thrust!
310,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Such is the tale the lady old,"
311,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Dorothy's daughter's daughter, told."
312,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
313,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Who the painter was none may tell,--"
314,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,One whose best was not over well;
315,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Hard and dry, it must be confessed,"
316,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Flat as a rose that has long been pressed;
317,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Yet in her cheek the hues are bright,"
318,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Dainty colors of red and white,"
319,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And in her slender shape are seen
320,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Hint and promise of stately mien.
321,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
322,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Look not on her with eyes of scorn,--"
323,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Dorothy Q. was a lady born!
324,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Ay! since the galloping Normans came,"
325,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,England's annals have known her name;
326,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And still to the three-billed rebel town
327,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Dear is that ancient name's renown,"
328,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"For many a civic wreath they won,"
329,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,The youthful sire and the gray-haired son.
330,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
331,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,O Damsel Dorothy! Dorothy Q.!
332,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Strange is the gift that I owe to you;
333,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Such a gift as never a king
334,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Save to daughter or son might bring,--"
335,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"All my tenure of heart and hand,"
336,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,All my title to house and land;
337,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Mother and sister and child and wife
338,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And joy and sorrow and death and life!
339,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
340,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,What if a hundred years ago
341,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Those close-shut lips had answered No,"
342,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,When forth the tremulous question came
343,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"That cost the maiden her Norman name,"
344,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And under the folds that look so still
345,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,The bodice swelled with the bosom's thrill?
346,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Should I be I, or would it be"
347,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"One tenth another, to nine tenths me?"
348,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
349,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Soft is the breath of a maiden's YES
350,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Not the light gossamer stirs with less;
351,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,But never a cable that holds so fast
352,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Through all the battles of wave and blast,"
353,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And never an echo of speech or song
354,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,That lives in the babbling air so long!
355,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,There were tones in the voice that whispered then
356,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,You may hear to-day in a hundred men.
357,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
358,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"O lady and lover, how faint and far"
359,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Your images hover,--and here we are,"
360,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Solid and stirring in flesh and bone,--"
361,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Edward's and Dorothy's--all their own,--"
362,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,A goodly record for Time to show
363,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Of a syllable spoken so long ago!--
364,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Shall I bless you, Dorothy, or forgive"
365,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,For the tender whisper that bade me live?
366,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
367,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"It shall be a blessing, my little maid!"
368,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"I will heal the stab of the Red-Coat's blade,"
369,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame,"
370,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And gild with a rhyme your household name;
371,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,So you shall smile on us brave and bright
372,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"As first you greeted the morning's light,"
373,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And live untroubled by woes and fears
374,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Through a second youth of a hundred years.

388,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"A moment lost, the next half seen,"
389,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"His head above the scanty screen,"
390,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Still measuring out his deep salaams
391,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Through quavering hymns and panting psalms.
392,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
393,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"No priest that prays in gilded stole,"
394,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,To save a rich man's mortgaged soul;
395,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"No sister, fresh from holy vows,"
396,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"So humbly stoops, so meekly bows;"
397,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,His large obeisance puts to shame
398,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"The proudest genuflecting dame,"
399,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Whose Easter bonnet low descends
400,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,With all the grace devotion lends.
401,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
402,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"O brother with the supple spine,"
403,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,How much we owe those bows of thine
404,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Without thine arm to lend the breeze,"
405,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,How vain the finger on the keys!
406,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Though all unmatched the player's skill,"
407,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Those thousand throats were dumb and still:
408,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Another's art may shape the tone,"
409,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,The breath that fills it is thine own.
410,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
411,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Six days the silent Memnon waits
412,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Behind his temple's folded gates;
413,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,But when the seventh day's sunshine falls
414,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Through rainbowed windows on the walls,"
415,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"He breathes, he sings, he shouts, he fills"
416,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,The quivering air with rapturous thrills;
417,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"The roof resounds, the pillars shake,"
418,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,And all the slumbering echoes wake!
419,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
420,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,The Preacher from the Bible-text
421,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,With weary words my soul has vexed
422,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"(Some stranger, fumbling far astray"
423,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,To find the lesson for the day);
424,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"He tells us truths too plainly true,"
425,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"And reads the service all askew,--"
426,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Why, why the--mischief--can't he look"
427,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Beforehand in the service-book?
428,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,

465,AT THE PANTOMIME,Heads piled on heads at every door;
466,AT THE PANTOMIME,Half dead with August's seething heat
467,AT THE PANTOMIME,"I crowded on and found my seat,"
468,AT THE PANTOMIME,"My patience slightly out of joint,"
469,AT THE PANTOMIME,"My temper short of boiling-point,"
470,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Not quite at _Hate mankind as such_,"
471,AT THE PANTOMIME,Nor yet at _Love them overmuch_.
472,AT THE PANTOMIME,
473,AT THE PANTOMIME,Amidst the throng the pageant drew
474,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Were gathered Hebrews not a few,"
475,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Black-bearded, swarthy,--at their side"
476,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Dark, jewelled women, orient-eyed:"
477,AT THE PANTOMIME,If scarce a Christian hopes for grace
478,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Who crowds one in his narrow place,"

483,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Wedged up against me, close and warm;"

485,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Betrayed the mould of Abraham's race,--"
486,AT THE PANTOMIME,"That coal-black hair, that smoke-brown hue,--"
487,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Ah, cursed, unbelieving Jew"
488,AT THE PANTOMIME,"I started, shuddering, to the right,"
489,AT THE PANTOMIME,And squeezed--a second Israelite.
490,AT THE PANTOMIME,
491,AT THE PANTOMIME,Then woke the evil brood of rage
492,AT THE PANTOMIME,"That slumber, tongueless, in their cage;"
493,AT THE PANTOMIME,I stabbed in turn with silent oaths
494,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The hook-nosed kite of carrion clothes,"
495,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The snaky usurer, him that crawls"
496,AT THE PANTOMIME,"And cheats beneath the golden balls,"
497,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Moses and Levi, all the horde,"
498,AT THE PANTOMIME,Spawn of the race that slew its Lord.
499,AT THE PANTOMIME,
500,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Up came their murderous deeds of old,"
501,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The grisly story Chaucer told,"
502,AT THE PANTOMIME,And many an ugly tale beside
503,AT THE PANTOMIME,Of children caught and crucified;
504,AT THE PANTOMIME,I heard the ducat-sweating thieves
505,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Beneath the Ghetto's slouching eaves,"
506,AT THE PANTOMIME,"And, thrust beyond the tented green,"

512,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Who but their Maker is to blame?"""
513,AT THE PANTOMIME,"I thought of Judas and his bribe,"
514,AT THE PANTOMIME,And steeled my soul against their tribe
515,AT THE PANTOMIME,My neighbors stirred; I looked again
516,AT THE PANTOMIME,Full on the younger of the twain.
517,AT THE PANTOMIME,
518,AT THE PANTOMIME,A fresh young cheek whose olive hue
519,AT THE PANTOMIME,The mantling blood shows faintly through;
520,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Locks dark as midnight, that divide"
521,AT THE PANTOMIME,And shade the neck on either side;
522,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Soft, gentle, loving eyes that gleam"
523,AT THE PANTOMIME,Clear as a starlit mountain stream;--
524,AT THE PANTOMIME,"So looked that other child of Shem,"
525,AT THE PANTOMIME,The Maiden's Boy of Bethlehem!
526,AT THE PANTOMIME,
527,AT THE PANTOMIME,And thou couldst scorn the peerless blood
528,AT THE PANTOMIME,"That flows immingled from the Flood,--"
529,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy scutcheon spotted with the stains
530,AT THE PANTOMIME,Of Norman thieves and pirate Danes!
531,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The New World's foundling, in thy pride"
532,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Scowl on the Hebrew at thy side,"
533,AT THE PANTOMIME,And lo! the very semblance there
534,AT THE PANTOMIME,The Lord of Glory deigned to wear!
535,AT THE PANTOMIME,
536,AT THE PANTOMIME,"I see that radiant image rise,"
537,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The flowing hair, the pitying eyes,"
538,AT THE PANTOMIME,The faintly crimsoned cheek that shows
539,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The blush of Sharon's opening rose,--"
540,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy hands would clasp his hallowed feet
541,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Whose brethren soil thy Christian seat,"
542,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy lips would press his garment's hem
543,AT THE PANTOMIME,That curl in wrathful scorn for them!
544,AT THE PANTOMIME,
545,AT THE PANTOMIME,"A sudden mist, a watery screen,"
546,AT THE PANTOMIME,Dropped like a veil before the scene;
547,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The shadow floated from my soul,"
548,AT THE PANTOMIME,"And to my lips a whisper stole,--"
549,AT THE PANTOMIME,"""Thy prophets caught the Spirit's flame,"

561,AFTER THE FIRE,
562,AFTER THE FIRE,WHILE far along the eastern sky
563,AFTER THE FIRE,"I saw the flags of Havoc fly,"
564,AFTER THE FIRE,As if his forces would assault

566,AFTER THE FIRE,And hurl Him back the burning rain
567,AFTER THE FIRE,"That seared the cities of the plain,"

584,AFTER THE FIRE,Flashed the false jewels of the fire;
585,AFTER THE FIRE,"Girt with her belt of glittering panes,"
586,AFTER THE FIRE,"And crowned with starry-gleaming vanes,"
587,AFTER THE FIRE,Our northern queen in glory shone
588,AFTER THE FIRE,"With new-born splendors not her own,"

590,AFTER THE FIRE,A victim decked for sacrifice!
591,AFTER THE FIRE,

596,AFTER THE FIRE,His devious footprints sadly tell
597,AFTER THE FIRE,How changed the pathways known so well;
598,AFTER THE FIRE,"The scene, how new! The tale, how old"
599,AFTER THE FIRE,Ere yet the ashes have grown cold!
600,AFTER THE FIRE,
601,AFTER THE FIRE,Again I read the words that came
602,AFTER THE FIRE,Writ in the rubric of the flame
603,AFTER THE FIRE,"Howe'r we trust to mortal things,"
604,AFTER THE FIRE,Each hath its pair of folded wings;
605,AFTER THE FIRE,Though long their terrors rest unspread
606,AFTER THE FIRE,Their fatal plumes are never shed;
607,AFTER THE FIRE,"At last, at last they spread in flight,"
608,AFTER THE FIRE,And blot the day and blast then night!
609,AFTER THE FIRE,
610,AFTER THE FIRE,"Hope, only Hope, of all that clings"
611,AFTER THE FIRE,"Around us, never spreads her wings;"
612,AFTER THE FIRE,"Love, though he break his earthly chain,"
613,AFTER THE FIRE,Still whispers he will come again;
614,AFTER THE FIRE,But Faith that soars to seek the sky
615,AFTER THE FIRE,"Shall teach our half-fledged souls to fly,"
616,AFTER THE FIRE,"And find, beyond the smoke and flame,"
617,AFTER THE FIRE,The cloudless azure whence they came!

672,A BALLAD OF THE BOSTON TEA-PARTY,Out from the Millpond's purlieus gush
673,A BALLAD OF THE BOSTON TEA-PARTY,"The streams of white-faced millers,"
