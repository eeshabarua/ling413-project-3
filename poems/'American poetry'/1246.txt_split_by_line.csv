39,PART I.,
40,PART I.,
41,I.,I.
42,I.,
43,I.,The sun goes down in a cold pale flare of light.
44,I.,The trees grow dark: the shadows lean to the east:
45,I.,"And lights wink out through the windows, one by one."
46,I.,A clamor of frosty sirens mourns at the night.
47,I.,Pale slate-grey clouds whirl up from the sunken sun.
48,I.,
49,I.,"And the wandering one, the inquisitive dreamer of dreams,"
50,I.,"The eternal asker of answers, stands in the street,"
51,I.,And lifts his palms for the first cold ghost of rain.
52,I.,The purple lights leap down the hill before him.
53,I.,The gorgeous night has begun again.
54,I.,
55,I.,"'I will ask them all, I will ask them all their dreams,"
56,I.,I will hold my light above them and seek their faces.
57,I.,"I will hear them whisper, invisible in their veins . . .'"
58,I.,"The eternal asker of answers becomes as the darkness,"
59,I.,"Or as a wind blown over a myriad forest,"
60,I.,Or as the numberless voices of long-drawn rains.
61,I.,
62,I.,"We hear him and take him among us, like a wind of music,"
63,I.,Like the ghost of a music we have somewhere heard;
64,I.,"We crowd through the streets in a dazzle of pallid lamplight,"
65,I.,"We pour in a sinister wave, ascend a stair,"
66,I.,"With laughter and cry, and word upon murmured word;"
67,I.,"We flow, we descend, we turn . . . and the eternal dreamer"
68,I.,"Moves among us like light, like evening air . . ."
69,I.,
70,I.,"Good-night!  Good-night!  Good-night!  We go our ways,"
71,I.,"The rain runs over the pavement before our feet,"
72,I.,"The cold rain falls, the rain sings."
73,I.,"We walk, we run, we ride.  We turn our faces"
74,I.,To what the eternal evening brings.
75,I.,
76,I.,"Our hands are hot and raw with the stones we have laid,"
77,I.,"We have built a tower of stone high into the sky,"
78,I.,We have built a city of towers.
79,I.,
80,I.,"Our hands are light, they are singing with emptiness."
81,I.,Our souls are light; they have shaken a burden of hours . . .
82,I.,What did we build it for?  Was it all a dream? . . .
83,I.,Ghostly above us in lamplight the towers gleam . . .
84,I.,And after a while they will fall to dust and rain;
85,I.,Or else we will tear them down with impatient hands;
86,I.,"And hew rock out of the earth, and build them again."
87,I.,
88,I.,
89,II.,II.
90,II.,
91,II.,"One, from his high bright window in a tower,"
92,II.,"Leans out, as evening falls,"
93,II.,And sees the advancing curtain of the shower
94,II.,Splashing its silver on roofs and walls:
95,II.,"Sees how, swift as a shadow, it crosses the city,"
96,II.,"And murmurs beyond far walls to the sea,"
97,II.,"Leaving a glimmer of water in the dark canyons,"
98,II.,And silver falling from eave and tree.
99,II.,
100,II.,"One, from his high bright window, looking down,"
101,II.,"Peers like a dreamer over the rain-bright town,"
102,II.,And thinks its towers are like a dream.
103,II.,"The western windows flame in the sun's last flare,"
104,II.,Pale roofs begin to gleam.
105,II.,
106,II.,Looking down from a window high in a wall
107,II.,He sees us all;
108,II.,"Lifting our pallid faces towards the rain,"
109,II.,"Searching the sky, and going our ways again,"
110,II.,"Standing in doorways, waiting under the trees . . ."
111,II.,"There, in the high bright window he dreams, and sees"
112,II.,"What we are blind to,--we who mass and crowd"
113,II.,From wall to wall in the darkening of a cloud.
114,II.,
115,II.,"The gulls drift slowly above the city of towers,"
116,II.,Over the roofs to the darkening sea they fly;
117,II.,Night falls swiftly on an evening of rain.
118,II.,The yellow lamps wink one by one again.
119,II.,The towers reach higher and blacker against the sky.
120,II.,
121,II.,
122,III.,III.
123,III.,
124,III.,"One, where the pale sea foamed at the yellow sand,"
125,III.,"With wave upon slowly shattering wave,"
126,III.,Turned to the city of towers as evening fell;
127,III.,And slowly walked by the darkening road toward it;
128,III.,And saw how the towers darkened against the sky;
129,III.,And across the distance heard the toll of a bell.
130,III.,
131,III.,"Along the darkening road he hurried alone,"
132,III.,"With his eyes cast down,"
133,III.,"And thought how the streets were hoarse with a tide of people,"
134,III.,"With clamor of voices, and numberless faces . . ."
135,III.,"And it seemed to him, of a sudden, that he would drown"
136,III.,"Here in the quiet of evening air,"
137,III.,These empty and voiceless places . . .
138,III.,"And he hurried towards the city, to enter there."
139,III.,
140,III.,"Along the darkening road, between tall trees"
141,III.,"That made a sinister whisper, loudly he walked."
142,III.,"Behind him, sea-gulls dipped over long grey seas."
143,III.,"Before him, numberless lovers smiled and talked."
144,III.,"And death was observed with sudden cries,"
145,III.,And birth with laughter and pain.
146,III.,And the trees grew taller and blacker against the skies
147,III.,And night came down again.
148,III.,
149,III.,
150,IV.,IV.
151,IV.,
152,IV.,"Up high black walls, up sombre terraces,"
153,IV.,"Clinging like luminous birds to the sides of cliffs,"
154,IV.,The yellow lights went climbing towards the sky.
155,IV.,"From high black walls, gleaming vaguely with rain,"
156,IV.,Each yellow light looked down like a golden eye.
157,IV.,
158,IV.,"They trembled from coign to coign, and tower to tower,"
159,IV.,Along high terraces quicker than dream they flew.
160,IV.,"And some of them steadily glowed, and some soon vanished,"
161,IV.,And some strange shadows threw.
162,IV.,
163,IV.,"And behind them all the ghosts of thoughts went moving,"
164,IV.,"Restlessly moving in each lamplit room,"
165,IV.,"From chair to mirror, from mirror to fire;"
166,IV.,"From some, the light was scarcely more than a gloom:"
167,IV.,"From some, a dazzling desire."
168,IV.,
169,IV.,"And there was one, beneath black eaves, who thought,"
170,IV.,"Combing with lifted arms her golden hair,"
171,IV.,Of the lover who hurried towards her through the night;
172,IV.,And there was one who dreamed of a sudden death
173,IV.,As she blew out her light.
174,IV.,
175,IV.,"And there was one who turned from clamoring streets,"
176,IV.,"And walked in lamplit gardens among black trees,"
177,IV.,"And looked at the windy sky,"
178,IV.,And thought with terror how stones and roots would freeze
179,IV.,And birds in the dead boughs cry . . .
180,IV.,
181,IV.,"And she hurried back, as snow fell, mixed with rain,"
182,IV.,"To mingle among the crowds again,"
183,IV.,To jostle beneath blue lamps along the street;
184,IV.,"And lost herself in the warm bright coiling dream,"
185,IV.,With a sound of murmuring voices and shuffling feet.
186,IV.,
187,IV.,"And one, from his high bright window looking down"
188,IV.,"On luminous chasms that cleft the basalt town,"
189,IV.,"Hearing a sea-like murmur rise,"
190,IV.,"Desired to leave his dream, descend from the tower,"
191,IV.,And drown in waves of shouts and laughter and cries.
192,IV.,
193,IV.,
194,V.,V.
195,V.,
196,V.,"The snow floats down upon us, mingled with rain . . ."
197,V.,"It eddies around pale lilac lamps, and falls"
198,V.,Down golden-windowed walls.
199,V.,"We were all born of flesh, in a flare of pain,"
200,V.,"We do not remember the red roots whence we rose,"
201,V.,"But we know that we rose and walked, that after a while"
202,V.,We shall lie down again.
203,V.,
204,V.,"The snow floats down upon us, we turn, we turn,"
205,V.,Through gorges filled with light we sound and flow . . .
206,V.,"One is struck down and hurt, we crowd about him,"
207,V.,"We bear him away, gaze after his listless body;"
208,V.,But whether he lives or dies we do not know.
209,V.,
210,V.,"One of us sings in the street, and we listen to him;"
211,V.,The words ring over us like vague bells of sorrow.
212,V.,He sings of a house he lived in long ago.
213,V.,It is strange; this house of dust was the house I lived in;
214,V.,"The house you lived in, the house that all of us know."
215,V.,"And coiling slowly about him, and laughing at him,"
216,V.,"And throwing him pennies, we bear away"
217,V.,"A mournful echo of other times and places,"
218,V.,And follow a dream . . . a dream that will not stay.
219,V.,
220,V.,Down long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow;
221,V.,"Noisy, in scattered waves, crowding and shouting;"
222,V.,In broken slow cascades.
223,V.,The gardens extend before us . . .  We spread out swiftly;
224,V.,"Trees are above us, and darkness.  The canyon fades . . ."
225,V.,
226,V.,"And we recall, with a gleaming stab of sadness,"
227,V.,"Vaguely and incoherently, some dream"
228,V.,"Of a world we came from, a world of sun-blue hills . . ."
229,V.,"A black wood whispers around us, green eyes gleam;"
230,V.,"Someone cries in the forest, and someone kills."
231,V.,
232,V.,"We flow to the east, to the white-lined shivering sea;"
233,V.,"We reach to the west, where the whirling sun went down;"
234,V.,We close our eyes to music in bright cafees.
235,V.,We diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent.
236,V.,We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays.
237,V.,
238,V.,"And, growing tired, we turn aside at last,"
239,V.,"Remember our secret selves, seek out our towers,"
240,V.,"Lay weary hands on the banisters, and climb;"
241,V.,"Climbing, each, to his little four-square dream"
242,V.,Of love or lust or beauty or death or crime.
243,V.,
244,V.,
245,VI.,VI.
246,VI.,
247,VI.,"Over the darkened city, the city of towers,"
248,VI.,"The city of a thousand gates,"
249,VI.,"Over the gleaming terraced roofs, the huddled towers,"
250,VI.,"Over a somnolent whisper of loves and hates,"
251,VI.,"The slow wind flows, drearily streams and falls,"
252,VI.,With a mournful sound down rain-dark walls.
253,VI.,"On one side purples the lustrous dusk of the sea,"
254,VI.,And dreams in white at the city's feet;
255,VI.,"On one side sleep the plains, with heaped-up hills."
256,VI.,Oaks and beeches whisper in rings about it.
257,VI.,Above the trees are towers where dread bells beat.
258,VI.,
259,VI.,The fisherman draws his streaming net from the sea
260,VI.,"And sails toward the far-off city, that seems"
261,VI.,Like one vague tower.
262,VI.,"The dark bow plunges to foam on blue-black waves,"
263,VI.,And shrill rain seethes like a ghostly music about him
264,VI.,In a quiet shower.
265,VI.,
266,VI.,Rain with a shrill sings on the lapsing waves;
267,VI.,Rain thrills over the roofs again;
268,VI.,Like a shadow of shifting silver it crosses the city;
269,VI.,The lamps in the streets are streamed with rain;
270,VI.,"And sparrows complain beneath deep eaves,"
271,VI.,And among whirled leaves
272,VI.,"The sea-gulls, blowing from tower to lower tower,"
273,VI.,"From wall to remoter wall,"
274,VI.,Skim with the driven rain to the rising sea-sound
275,VI.,And close grey wings and fall . . .
276,VI.,
277,VI.,". . . Hearing great rain above me, I now remember"
278,VI.,A girl who stood by the door and shut her eyes:
279,VI.,"Her pale cheeks glistened with rain, she stood and shivered."
280,VI.,Into a forest of silver she vanished slowly . . .
281,VI.,Voices about me rise . . .
282,VI.,
283,VI.,"Voices clear and silvery, voices of raindrops,--"
284,VI.,"'We struck with silver claws, we struck her down."
285,VI.,We are the ghosts of the singing furies . . . '
286,VI.,A chorus of elfin voices blowing about me
287,VI.,Weaves to a babel of sound.  Each cries a secret.
288,VI.,"I run among them, reach out vain hands, and drown."
289,VI.,
290,VI.,"'I am the one who stood beside you and smiled,"
291,VI.,Thinking your face so strangely young . . . '
292,VI.,'I am the one who loved you but did not dare.'
293,VI.,"'I am the one you followed through crowded streets,"
294,VI.,"The one who escaped you, the one with red-gleamed hair.'"
295,VI.,
296,VI.,"'I am the one you saw to-day, who fell"
297,VI.,"Senseless before you, hearing a certain bell:"
298,VI.,A bell that broke great memories in my brain.'
299,VI.,"'I am the one who passed unnoticed before you,"
300,VI.,"Invisible, in a cloud of secret pain.'"
301,VI.,
302,VI.,"'I am the one who suddenly cried, beholding"
303,VI.,The face of a certain man on the dazzling screen.
304,VI.,They wrote me that he was dead.  It was long ago.
305,VI.,"I walked in the streets for a long while, hearing nothing,"
306,VI.,And returned to see it again.  And it was so.'
307,VI.,
308,VI.,
309,VI.,"Weave, weave, weave, you streaks of rain!"
310,VI.,I am dissolved and woven again . . .
311,VI.,Thousands of faces rise and vanish before me.
312,VI.,Thousands of voices weave in the rain.
313,VI.,
314,VI.,"'I am the one who rode beside you, blinking"
315,VI.,At a dazzle of golden lights.
316,VI.,Tempests of music swept me: I was thinking
317,VI.,Of the gorgeous promise of certain nights:
318,VI.,"Of the woman who suddenly smiled at me this day,"
319,VI.,"Smiled in a certain delicious sidelong way,"
320,VI.,"And turned, as she reached the door,"
321,VI.,To smile once more . . .
322,VI.,Her hands are whiter than snow on midnight water.
323,VI.,"Her throat is golden and full of golden laughter,"
324,VI.,Her eyes are strange as the stealth of the moon
325,VI.,On a night in June . . .
326,VI.,She runs among whistling leaves; I hurry after;
327,VI.,She dances in dreams over white-waved water;
328,VI.,"Her body is white and fragrant and cool,"
329,VI.,Magnolia petals that float on a white-starred pool . . .
330,VI.,"I have dreamed of her, dreaming for many nights"
331,VI.,"Of a broken music and golden lights,"
332,VI.,"Of broken webs of silver, heavily falling"
333,VI.,Between my hands and their white desire:
334,VI.,"And dark-leaved boughs, edged with a golden radiance,"
335,VI.,Dipping to screen a fire . . .
336,VI.,"I dream that I walk with her beneath high trees,"
337,VI.,"But as I lean to kiss her face,"
338,VI.,"She is blown aloft on wind, I catch at leaves,"
339,VI.,And run in a moonless place;
340,VI.,"And I hear a crashing of terrible rocks flung down,"
341,VI.,"And shattering trees and cracking walls,"
342,VI.,"And a net of intense white flame roars over the town,"
343,VI.,And someone cries; and darkness falls . . .
344,VI.,"But now she has leaned and smiled at me,"
345,VI.,"My veins are afire with music,"
346,VI.,"Her eyes have kissed me, my body is turned to light;"
347,VI.,I shall dream to her secret heart tonight . . . '
348,VI.,
349,VI.,"He rises and moves away, he says no word,"
350,VI.,He folds his evening paper and turns away;
351,VI.,I rush through the dark with rows of lamplit faces;
352,VI.,"Fire bells peal, and some of us turn to listen,"
353,VI.,And some sit motionless in their accustomed places.
354,VI.,
355,VI.,"Cold rain lashes the car-roof, scurries in gusts,"
356,VI.,Streams down the windows in waves and ripples of lustre;
357,VI.,The lamps in the streets are distorted and strange.
358,VI.,Someone takes his watch from his pocket and yawns.
359,VI.,One peers out in the night for the place to change.
360,VI.,
361,VI.,"Rain . . . rain . . . rain . . . we are buried in rain,"
362,VI.,"It will rain forever, the swift wheels hiss through water,"
363,VI.,Pale sheets of water gleam in the windy street.
364,VI.,The pealing of bells is lost in a drive of rain-drops.
365,VI.,Remote and hurried the great bells beat.
366,VI.,
367,VI.,"'I am the one whom life so shrewdly betrayed,"
368,VI.,"Misfortune dogs me, it always hunted me down."
369,VI.,And to-day the woman I love lies dead.
370,VI.,"I gave her roses, a ring with opals;"
371,VI.,These hands have touched her head.
372,VI.,
373,VI.,"'I bound her to me in all soft ways,"
374,VI.,"I bound her to me in a net of days,"
375,VI.,Yet now she has gone in silence and said no word.
376,VI.,"How can we face these dazzling things, I ask you?"
377,VI.,There is no use: we cry: and are not heard.
378,VI.,
379,VI.,'They cover a body with roses . . . I shall not see it . . .
380,VI.,Must one return to the lifeless walls of a city
381,VI.,Whose soul is charred by fire? . . . '
382,VI.,"His eyes are closed, his lips press tightly together."
383,VI.,Wheels hiss beneath us.  He yields us our desire.
384,VI.,
385,VI.,"'No, do not stare so--he is weak with grief,"
386,VI.,"He cannot face you, he turns his eyes aside;"
387,VI.,He is confused with pain.
388,VI.,I suffered this.  I know.  It was long ago . . .
389,VI.,He closes his eyes and drowns in death again.'
390,VI.,
391,VI.,"The wind hurls blows at the rain-starred glistening windows,"
392,VI.,The wind shrills down from the half-seen walls.
393,VI.,We flow on the mournful wind in a dream of dying;
394,VI.,And at last a silence falls.
395,VI.,
396,VI.,
397,VII.,VII.
398,VII.,
399,VII.,"Midnight; bells toll, and along the cloud-high towers"
400,VII.,The golden lights go out . . .
401,VII.,"The yellow windows darken, the shades are drawn,"
402,VII.,"In thousands of rooms we sleep, we await the dawn,"
403,VII.,"We lie face down, we dream,"
404,VII.,"We cry aloud with terror, half rise, or seem"
405,VII.,To stare at the ceiling or walls . . .
406,VII.,Midnight . . . the last of shattering bell-notes falls.
407,VII.,"A rush of silence whirls over the cloud-high towers,"
408,VII.,A vortex of soundless hours.
409,VII.,
410,VII.,'The bells have just struck twelve: I should be sleeping.
411,VII.,But I cannot delay any longer to write and tell you.
412,VII.,The woman is dead.
413,VII.,She died--you know the way.  Just as we planned.
414,VII.,"Smiling, with open sunlit eyes."
415,VII.,Smiling upon the outstretched fatal hand . . .'
416,VII.,
417,VII.,"He folds his letter, steps softly down the stairs."
418,VII.,The doors are closed and silent.  A gas-jet flares.
419,VII.,His shadow disturbs a shadow of balustrades.
420,VII.,The door swings shut behind.  Night roars above him.
421,VII.,Into the night he fades.
422,VII.,
423,VII.,Wind; wind; wind; carving the walls;
424,VII.,Blowing the water that gleams in the street;
425,VII.,"Blowing the rain, the sleet."
426,VII.,"In the dark alley, an old tree cracks and falls,"
427,VII.,Oak-boughs moan in the haunted air;
428,VII.,Lamps blow down with a crash and tinkle of glass . . .
429,VII.,Darkness whistles . . . Wild hours pass . . .
430,VII.,
431,VII.,"And those whom sleep eludes lie wide-eyed, hearing"
432,VII.,Above their heads a goblin night go by;
433,VII.,"Children are waked, and cry,"
434,VII.,"The young girl hears the roar in her sleep, and dreams"
435,VII.,"That her lover is caught in a burning tower,"
436,VII.,"She clutches the pillow, she gasps for breath, she screams . . ."
437,VII.,"And then by degrees her breath grows quiet and slow,"
438,VII.,"She dreams of an evening, long ago:"
439,VII.,"Of colored lanterns balancing under trees,"
440,VII.,Some of them softly catching afire;
441,VII.,"And beneath the lanterns a motionless face she sees,"
442,VII.,"Golden with lamplight, smiling, serene . . ."
443,VII.,"The leaves are a pale and glittering green,"
444,VII.,"The sound of horns blows over the trampled grass,"
445,VII.,Shadows of dancers pass . . .
446,VII.,"The face smiles closer to hers, she tries to lean"
447,VII.,"Backward, away, the eyes burn close and strange,"
448,VII.,"The face is beginning to change,--"
449,VII.,"It is her lover, she no longer desires to resist,"
450,VII.,She is held and kissed.
451,VII.,"She closes her eyes, and melts in a seethe of flame . . ."
452,VII.,With a smoking ghost of shame . . .
453,VII.,
454,VII.,"Wind, wind, wind . . .  Wind in an enormous brain"
455,VII.,Blowing dark thoughts like fallen leaves . . .
456,VII.,"The wind shrieks, the wind grieves;"
457,VII.,"It dashes the leaves on walls, it whirls then again;"
458,VII.,And the enormous sleeper vaguely and stupidly dreams
459,VII.,"And desires to stir, to resist a ghost of pain."
460,VII.,
461,VII.,"One, whom the city imprisoned because of his cunning,"
462,VII.,"Who dreamed for years in a tower,"
463,VII.,Seizes this hour
464,VII.,"Of tumult and wind.  He files through the rusted bar,"
465,VII.,"Leans his face to the rain, laughs up at the night,"
466,VII.,"Slides down the knotted sheet, swings over the wall,"
467,VII.,"To fall to the street with a cat-like fall,"
468,VII.,"Slinks round a quavering rim of windy light,"
469,VII.,"And at last is gone,"
470,VII.,Leaving his empty cell for the pallor of dawn . . .
471,VII.,
472,VII.,The mother whose child was buried to-day
473,VII.,Turns her face to the window; her face is grey;

550,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,More towers must yet be built--more towers destroyed--
551,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Great rocks hoisted in air;
552,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,And he must seek his bread in high pale sunlight
553,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"With gulls about him, and clouds just over his eyes . . ."
554,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,And so he did not mention his dream of falling
555,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"But drank his coffee in silence, and heard in his ears"
556,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"That horrible whistle of wind, and felt his breath"
557,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Sucked out of him, and saw the tower flash by"
558,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,And the small tree swell beneath him . . .
559,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He patted his boy on the head, and kissed his wife,"
560,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Looked quickly around the room, to remember it,--"
561,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And so went out . . .  For once, he forgot his pail."
562,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,
563,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Something had changed--but it was not the street--
564,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,The street was just the same--it was himself.
565,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Puddles flashed in the sun.  In the pawn-shop door
566,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,The same old black cat winked green amber eyes;
567,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,The butcher stood by his window tying his apron;
568,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"The same men walked beside him, smoking pipes,"
569,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Reading the morning paper . . .
570,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,
571,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He would not yield, he thought, and walk more slowly,"
572,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,As if he knew for certain he walked to death:
573,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"But with his usual pace,--deliberate, firm,"
574,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Looking about him calmly, watching the world,"
575,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Taking his ease . . .  Yet, when he thought again"
576,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Of the same dream, now dreamed three separate times,"
577,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Always the same, and heard that whistling wind,"
578,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And saw the windows flashing upward past him,--"
579,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He slowed his pace a little, and thought with horror"
580,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,How monstrously that small tree thrust to meet him! . . .
581,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,He slowed his pace a little and remembered his wife.
582,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,
583,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Was forty, then, too old for work like this?"
584,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Why should it be?  He'd never been afraid--
585,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"His eye was sure, his hand was steady . . ."
586,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,But dreams had meanings.
587,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He walked more slowly, and looked along the roofs,"
588,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"All built by men, and saw the pale blue sky;"
589,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And suddenly he was dizzy with looking at it,"
590,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"It seemed to whirl and swim,"
591,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"It seemed the color of terror, of speed, of death . . ."
592,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He lowered his eyes to the stones, he walked more slowly;"
593,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,His thoughts were blown and scattered like leaves;
594,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He thought of the pail . . . Why, then, was it forgotten?"
595,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Because he would not need it?
596,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,
597,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Then, just as he was grouping his thoughts again"
598,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"About that drug-store corner, under an arc-lamp,"
599,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Where first he met the girl whom he would marry,--"
600,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"That blue-eyed innocent girl, in a soft blouse,--"
601,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He waved his hand for signal, and up he went"
602,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,In the dusty chute that hugged the wall;
603,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Above the tree; from girdered floor to floor;
604,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Above the flattening roofs, until the sea"
605,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Lay wide and waved before him . . . And then he stepped
606,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Giddily out, from that security,"
607,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"To the red rib of iron against the sky,"
608,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And walked along it, feeling it sing and tremble;"
609,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And looking down one instant, saw the tree"
610,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Just as he dreamed it was; and looked away,"
611,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And up again, feeling his blood go wild."
612,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,
613,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,He gave the signal; the long girder swung
614,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Closer to him, dropped clanging into place,"
615,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Almost pushing him off.  Pneumatic hammers
616,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Began their madhouse clatter, the white-hot rivets"
617,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Were tossed from below and deftly caught in pails;
618,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"He signalled again, and wiped his mouth, and thought"
619,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,A place so high in the air should be more quiet.
620,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"The tree, far down below, teased at his eyes,"
621,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Teased at the corners of them, until he looked,"
622,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,And felt his body go suddenly small and light;
623,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,Felt his brain float off like a dwindling vapor;
624,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"And heard a whistle of wind, and saw a tree"
625,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"Come plunging up to him, and thought to himself,"
626,II. THE FULFILLED DREAM,"'By God--I'm done for now, the dream was right . . .'"

771,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Yellows and greens in the dark,--she walked again"
772,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Those nightmare streets which she had walked so often . . .
773,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Here, at a certain corner, under an arc-lamp,"
774,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Blown by a bitter wind, she stopped and looked"
775,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"In through the brilliant windows of a drug-store,"
776,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,And wondered if she dared to ask for poison:
777,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"But it was late, few customers were there,"
778,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"The eyes of all the clerks would freeze upon her,"
779,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"And she would wilt, and cry . . .  Here, by the river,"

784,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Struck her cheek, and withered her veins . . . And so"

786,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,
787,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Paul hadn't guessed it yet--though twice, already,"
788,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She'd fainted--once, the first time, on the stage."
789,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,So she must tell him soon--or else--get out . . .
790,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,How could she say it?  That was the hideous thing.
791,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She'd rather die than say it! . . . and all the trouble,"
792,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Months when she couldn't earn a cent, and then,"
793,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"If he refused to marry her . . . well, what?"
794,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She saw him laughing, making a foolish joke,"
795,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,His grey eyes turning quickly; and the words
796,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Fled from her tongue . . .  She saw him sitting silent,"
797,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Brooding over his morning coffee, maybe,"
798,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"And tried again . . . she bit her lips, and trembled,"
799,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"And looked away, and said . . . 'Say Paul, boy,--listen--"
800,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"There's something I must tell you . . . '  There she stopped,"

803,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,'But what I've got to say--IS--serious!'

805,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"His eyes would darken, he'd look so terrifying--"
806,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,He always did--and what could she do but cry?
807,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Perhaps, then, he would guess--perhaps he wouldn't."
808,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"And if he didn't, but asked her 'What's the matter?'--"
809,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,She knew she'd never tell--just say she was sick . . .
810,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"And after that, when would she dare again?"
811,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,And what would he do--even suppose she told him?
812,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,
813,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,If it were Felix!  If it were only Felix!--
814,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She wouldn't mind so much.  But as it was,"
815,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"Bitterness choked her, she had half a mind"
816,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"To pay out Felix for never having liked her,"
817,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,By making people think that it was he . . .
818,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She'd write a letter to someone, before she died,--"
819,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Just saying 'Felix did it--and wouldn't marry.'
820,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,And then she'd die . . .  But that was hard on Paul . . .
821,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Paul would never forgive her--he'd never forgive her!
822,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Sometimes she almost thought Paul really loved her . . .
823,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,She saw him look reproachfully at her coffin.
824,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,
825,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,And then she closed her eyes and walked again
826,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Those nightmare streets that she had walked so often:
827,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Under an arc-lamp swinging in the wind
828,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"She stood, and stared in through a drug-store window,"
829,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Watching a clerk wrap up a little pill-box.
830,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,"But it was late.  No customers were there,--"
831,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,Pitiless eyes would freeze her secret in her!
832,VI. ADELE AND DAVIS,And then--what poison would she dare to ask for?

846,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Only, their words like music seem to play;"

848,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,
849,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,'I brought you this . . . ' the soft words float like stars

854,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Glisten and murmur among the trees.
855,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Someone calls from the house.  She does not answer.
856,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Backward she leans her head,"
857,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"And dreamily smiles at the peach-tree leaves, wherethrough"
858,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,She sees an infinite May sky spread
859,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,A vault profoundly blue.
860,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"The voice from the house fades far away,"
861,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,The glistening leaves more vaguely ripple and sway . .
862,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"The tap is closed, the water ceases to hiss . . ."
863,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Silence . . . blue sky . . . and then, 'I brought you this . . . '"

866,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,
867,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,She turns to him and smiles . . . Sunlight above him
868,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Roars like a vast invisible sea,"
869,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Gold is beaten before him, shrill bells of silver;"
870,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"He is released of weight, his body is free,"
871,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"He lifts his arms to swim,"
872,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Dark years like sinister tides coil under him . . .
873,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,The lazy sea-waves crumble along the beach
874,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"With a whirring sound like wind in bells,"
875,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,He lies outstretched on the yellow wind-worn sands
876,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Reaching his lazy hands

895,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"She saw the lightning, with long blue quiver of light,"
896,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Ripping the darkness . . . and as she turned in terror
897,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"A soft face leaned above her, leaned softly down,"
898,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"Softly around her a breath of roses was blown,"
899,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"She sank in waves of quiet, she seemed to float"

909,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"We press upon them, we hold them, and let them pass;"
910,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,A chord of music strikes us and straight we tremble;
911,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,We tremble like wind-blown grass.
912,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,
913,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"What was this dream we had, a dream of music,"
914,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,Music that rose from the opening earth like magic
915,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,And shook its beauty upon us and died away?
916,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,The long cold streets extend once more before us.
917,VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES,"The red sun drops, the walls grow grey."

921,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,
922,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Well,--it was two days after my husband died--"
923,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Two days!  And the earth still raw above him.
924,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,And I was sweeping the carpet in their hall.
925,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,In number four--the room with the red wall-paper--
926,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Some chorus girls and men were singing that song
927,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,'They'll soon be lighting candles
928,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Round a box with silver handles'--and hearing them sing it
929,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,I started to cry.  Just then he came along
930,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me,"
931,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,And took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled
932,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And said, 'Say, what's the matter?' and then came down"
933,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Where I was leaning against the wall,"
934,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And touched my shoulder, and put his arm around me . . ."
935,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And I was so sad, thinking about it,--"
936,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Thinking that it was raining, and a cold night,"
937,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"With Jim so unaccustomed to being dead,--"
938,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"That I was happy to have him sympathize,"
939,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"To feel his arm, and leaned against him and cried."
940,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And before I knew it, he got me into a room"
941,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Where a table was set, and no one there,"
942,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And sat me down on a sofa, and held me close,"
943,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And talked to me, telling me not to cry,"
944,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"That it was all right, he'd look after me,--"
945,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"But not to cry, my eyes were getting red,"
946,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Which didn't make me pretty.  And he was so nice,"
947,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"That when he turned my face between his hands,"
948,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And looked at me, with those blue eyes of his,"
949,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And smiled, and leaned, and kissed me--"
950,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Somehow I couldn't tell him not to do it,"
951,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Somehow I didn't mind, I let him kiss me,"
952,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And closed my eyes! . . . Well, that was how it started."
953,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"For when my heart was eased with crying, and grief"
954,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Had passed and left me quiet, somehow it seemed"
955,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"As if it wasn't honest to change my mind,"
956,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"To send him away, or say I hadn't meant it--"
957,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And, anyway, it seemed so hard to explain!"
958,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And so we sat and talked, not talking much,"
959,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"But meaning as much in silence as in words,"
960,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"There in that empty room with palms about us,"
961,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,That private dining-room . . . And as we sat there
962,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"I felt my future changing, day by day,"
963,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"With unknown streets opening left and right,"
964,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"New streets with farther lights, new taller houses,"
965,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Doors swinging into hallways filled with light,"
966,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Half-opened luminous windows, with white curtains"
967,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Streaming out in the night, and sudden music,--"
968,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And thinking of this, and through it half remembering"
969,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"A quick and horrible death, my husband's eyes,"
970,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"The broken-plastered walls, my boy asleep,--"
971,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,It seemed as if my brain would break in two.
972,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"My voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood,"
973,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And told him I must go, and said good-night--"
974,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,I couldn't see the end.  How would it end?
975,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Would he return to-morrow?  Or would he not?
976,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,And did I want him to--or would I rather
977,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Look for another job?--He took my shoulders
978,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"Between his hands, and looked down into my eyes,"
979,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And smiled, and said good-night.  If he had kissed me,"
980,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"That would have--well, I don't know; but he didn't . ."
981,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And so I went downstairs, then, half elated,"
982,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,Hoping to close the door before that party
983,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,In number four should sing that song again--
984,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,'They'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles'--
985,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,"And sure enough, I did.  I faced the darkness."
986,VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES,And my eyes were filled with tears.  And I was happy.

1011,IX. INTERLUDE,Hands reach up to tear me.  My brain will fail.

1199,I,"Laces her golden slippers, and runs through the door"
1200,I,"To dance once more,"
1201,I,"Hearing swift music like an enchantment rise,"
1202,I,Feeling the praise of a thousand eyes.
1203,I,
1204,I,As darkness falls
1205,I,"The walls grow luminous and warm, the walls"
1206,I,"Tremble and glow with the lives within them moving,"
1207,I,"Moving like music, secret and rich and warm."
1208,I,How shall we live tonight?  Where shall we turn?
1209,I,To what new light or darkness yearn?
1210,I,A thousand winding stairs lead down before us;
1211,I,And one by one in myriads we descend
1212,I,"By lamplit flowered walls, long balustrades,"
1213,I,Through half-lit halls which reach no end.

1217,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1218,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"You read--what is it, then that you are reading?"
1219,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,What music moves so silently in your mind?
1220,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Your bright hand turns the page.
1221,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"I watch you from my window, unsuspected:"
1222,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"You move in an alien land, a silent age . . ."
1223,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1224,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,. . .  The poet--what was his name--?  Tokkei--Tokkei--
1225,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The poet walked alone in a cold late rain,"
1226,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And thought his grief was like the crying of sea-birds;
1227,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"For his lover was dead, he never would love again."
1228,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1229,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Rain in the dreams of the mind--rain forever--
1230,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Rain in the sky of the heart--rain in the willows--
1231,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"But then he saw this face, this face like flame,"
1232,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"This quiet lady, this portrait by Hiroshigi;"
1233,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And took it home with him; and with it came
1234,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1235,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"What unexpected changes, subtle as weather!"
1236,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The dark room, cold as rain,"
1237,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Grew faintly fragrant, stirred with a stir of April,"
1238,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Warmed its corners with light again,"
1239,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1240,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And smoke of incense whirled about this portrait,"
1241,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And the quiet lady there,"
1242,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"So young, so quietly smiling, with calm hands,"
1243,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Seemed ready to loose her hair,"
1244,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1245,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And smile, and lean from the picture, or say one word,"
1246,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The word already clear,"
1247,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Which seemed to rise like light between her eyelids . .
1248,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"He held his breath to hear,"
1249,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1250,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And smiled for shame, and drank a cup of wine,"
1251,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And held a candle, and searched her face"
1252,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Through all the little shadows, to see what secret"
1253,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Might give so warm a grace . . .
1254,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1255,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Was it the quiet mouth, restrained a little?"
1256,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The eyes, half-turned aside?"
1257,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The jade ring on her wrist, still almost swinging? . . ."
1258,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The secret was denied,"
1259,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1260,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"He chose his favorite pen and drew these verses,"
1261,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And slept; and as he slept
1262,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"A dream came into his heart, his lover entered,"
1263,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And chided him, and wept."
1264,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1265,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And in the morning, waking, he remembered,"
1266,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And thought the dream was strange.
1267,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Why did his darkened lover rise from the garden?
1268,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"He turned, and felt a change,"
1269,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1270,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,As if a someone hidden smiled and watched him . . .
1271,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Yet there was only sunlight there.
1272,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Until he saw those young eyes, quietly smiling,"
1273,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And held his breath to stare,"
1274,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1275,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And could have sworn her cheek had turned--a little . . .
1276,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Had slightly turned away . . .
1277,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Sunlight dozed on the floor . . . He sat and wondered,"
1278,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Nor left his room that day.
1279,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1280,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And that day, and for many days thereafter,"
1281,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"He sat alone, and thought"
1282,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,No lady had ever lived so beautiful
1283,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,As Hiroshigi wrought . . .
1284,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1285,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Or if she lived, no matter in what country,"
1286,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"By what far river or hill or lonely sea,"
1287,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,He would look in every face until he found her . . .
1288,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,There was no other as fair as she.
1289,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1290,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And before her quiet face he burned soft incense,"
1291,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And brought her every day
1292,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Boughs of the peach, or almond, or snow-white cherry,"
1293,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And somehow, she seemed to say,"
1294,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1295,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"That silent lady, young, and quietly smiling,"
1296,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,That she was happy there;
1297,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And sometimes, seeing this, he started to tremble,"
1298,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And desired to touch her hair,"
1299,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1300,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"To lay his palm along her hand, touch faintly"
1301,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,With delicate finger-tips
1302,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,The ghostly smile that seemed to hover and vanish
1303,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Upon her lips . . .
1304,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1305,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Until he knew he loved this quiet lady;
1306,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And night by night a dread
1307,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Leered at his dreams, for he knew that Hiroshigi"
1308,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Was many centuries dead,--"
1309,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1310,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And the lady, too, was dead, and all who knew her . ."
1311,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Dead, and long turned to dust . . ."
1312,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The thin moon waxed and waned, and left him paler,"
1313,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The peach leaves flew in a gust,"
1314,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1315,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And he would surely have died; but there one day
1316,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"A wise man, white with age,"
1317,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Stared at the portrait, and said, 'This Hiroshigi"
1318,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Knew more than archimage,--"
1319,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1320,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Cunningly drew the body, and called the spirit,"
1321,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Till partly it entered there . . .
1322,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Sometimes, at death, it entered the portrait wholly . ."
1323,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Do all I say with care,"
1324,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1325,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And she you love may come to you when you call her . . . '
1326,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"So then this ghost, Tokkei,"
1327,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Ran in the sun, bought wine of a hundred merchants,"
1328,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And alone at the end of day
1329,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1330,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Entered the darkening room, and faced the portrait,"
1331,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And saw the quiet eyes
1332,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Gleaming and young in the dusk, and held the wine-cup,"
1333,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And knelt, and did not rise,"
1334,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1335,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And said, aloud, 'Lo-san, will you drink this wine?'"
1336,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Said it three times aloud.
1337,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And at the third the faint blue smoke of incense
1338,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Rose to the walls in a cloud,"
1339,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1340,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And the lips moved faintly, and the eyes, and the calm hands stirred;"
1341,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And suddenly, with a sigh,"
1342,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"The quiet lady came slowly down from the portrait,"
1343,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And stood, while worlds went by,"
1344,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1345,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And lifted her young white hands and took the wine cup;
1346,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And the poet trembled, and said,"
1347,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"'Lo-san, will you stay forever?'--'Yes, I will stay.'--"
1348,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,'But what when I am dead?'
1349,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1350,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"'When you are dead your spirit will find my spirit,"
1351,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,And then we shall die no more.'
1352,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"Music came down upon them, and spring returning,"
1353,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"They remembered worlds before,"
1354,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,
1355,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And years went over the earth, and over the sea,"
1356,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"And lovers were born and spoke and died,"
1357,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,"But forever in sunlight went these two immortal,"
1358,II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN,Tokkei and the quiet bride . . .

1371,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,Elaine was married and soon to have a child.

1380,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,
1381,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,We walk with you.  Where is it that you lead us?
1382,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,We climb the muffled stairs beneath high lanterns.
1383,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,We descend again.  We grope through darkened cells.
1384,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,"You say: this darkness, here, will slowly kill me."
1385,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,It creeps and weighs upon me . . . Is full of bells.

1390,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,"Fatigue! it says, and points its finger at me;"
1391,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,Touches my throat and stops my breath.
1392,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,
1393,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,My fans--my jewels--the portrait of my husband--
1394,III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS,The torn certificate for my daughter's grave--

1408,IV. ILLICIT,Of what she said to me that night--no matter.
1409,IV. ILLICIT,The strange thing came next day.
1410,IV. ILLICIT,My brain was full of music--something she played me--;
1411,IV. ILLICIT,"I couldn't remember it all, but phrases of it"
1412,IV. ILLICIT,"Wreathed and wreathed among faint memories,"
1413,IV. ILLICIT,"Seeking for something, trying to tell me something,"
1414,IV. ILLICIT,Urging to restlessness: verging on grief.
1415,IV. ILLICIT,"I tried to play the tune, from memory,--"
1416,IV. ILLICIT,But memory failed: the chords and discords climbed
1417,IV. ILLICIT,"And found no resolution--only hung there,"
1418,IV. ILLICIT,"And left me morbid . . . Where, then, had I heard it? . . ."
1419,IV. ILLICIT,What secret dusty chamber was it hinting?
1420,IV. ILLICIT,"'Dust', it said, 'dust . . . and dust . . . and sunlight . ."
1421,IV. ILLICIT,"A cold clear April evening . . . snow, bedraggled,"
1422,IV. ILLICIT,"Rain-worn snow, dappling the hideous grass . . ."
1423,IV. ILLICIT,And someone walking alone; and someone saying
1424,IV. ILLICIT,"That all must end, for the time had come to go . . . '"
1425,IV. ILLICIT,"These were the phrases . . . but behind, beneath them"
1426,IV. ILLICIT,A greater shadow moved: and in this shadow
1427,IV. ILLICIT,I stood and guessed . . . Was it the blue-eyed lady?
1428,IV. ILLICIT,The one who always danced in golden slippers--
1429,IV. ILLICIT,"And had I danced with her,--upon this music?"
1430,IV. ILLICIT,Or was it further back--the unplumbed twilight
1431,IV. ILLICIT,Of childhood?--No--much recenter than that.
1432,IV. ILLICIT,
1433,IV. ILLICIT,"You know, without my telling you, how sometimes"
1434,IV. ILLICIT,"A word or name eludes you, and you seek it"
1435,IV. ILLICIT,"Through running ghosts of shadow,--leaping at it,"
1436,IV. ILLICIT,"Lying in wait for it to spring upon it,"
1437,IV. ILLICIT,Spreading faint snares for it of sense or sound:
1438,IV. ILLICIT,"Until, of a sudden, as if in a phantom forest,"
1439,IV. ILLICIT,"You hear it, see it flash among the branches,"
1440,IV. ILLICIT,"And scarcely knowing how, suddenly have it--"
1441,IV. ILLICIT,"Well, it was so I followed down this music,"
1442,IV. ILLICIT,"Glimpsing a face in darkness, hearing a cry,"
1443,IV. ILLICIT,"Remembering days forgotten, moods exhausted,"
1444,IV. ILLICIT,"Corners in sunlight, puddles reflecting stars--;"
1445,IV. ILLICIT,"Until, of a sudden, and least of all suspected,"
1446,IV. ILLICIT,The thing resolved itself: and I remembered
1447,IV. ILLICIT,"An April afternoon, eight years ago--"
1448,IV. ILLICIT,Or was it nine?--no matter--call it nine--
1449,IV. ILLICIT,A room in which the last of sunlight faded;
1450,IV. ILLICIT,"A vase of violets, fragrance in white curtains;"
1451,IV. ILLICIT,"And, she who played the same thing later, playing."
1452,IV. ILLICIT,
1453,IV. ILLICIT,She played this tune.  And in the middle of it
1454,IV. ILLICIT,"Abruptly broke it off, letting her hands"
1455,IV. ILLICIT,"Fall in her lap.  She sat there so a moment,"
1456,IV. ILLICIT,"With shoulders drooped, then lifted up a rose,"
1457,IV. ILLICIT,"One great white rose, wide opened like a lotos,"
1458,IV. ILLICIT,"And pressed it to her cheek, and closed her eyes."
1459,IV. ILLICIT,
1460,IV. ILLICIT,'You know--we've got to end this--Miriam loves you . . .
1461,IV. ILLICIT,"If she should ever know, or even guess it,--"
1462,IV. ILLICIT,What would she do?--Listen!--I'm not absurd . . .
1463,IV. ILLICIT,"I'm sure of it.  If you had eyes, for women--"
1464,IV. ILLICIT,To understand them--which you've never had--
1465,IV. ILLICIT,"You'd know it too . . . '  So went this colloquy,"
1466,IV. ILLICIT,"Half humorous, with undertones of pathos,"
1467,IV. ILLICIT,"Half grave, half flippant . . . while her fingers, softly,"
1468,IV. ILLICIT,"Felt for this tune, played it and let it fall,"
1469,IV. ILLICIT,"Now note by singing note, now chord by chord,"
1470,IV. ILLICIT,Repeating phrases with a kind of pleasure . . .
1471,IV. ILLICIT,Was it symbolic of the woman's weakness
1472,IV. ILLICIT,That she could neither break it--nor conclude?
1473,IV. ILLICIT,"It paused . . . and wandered . . . paused again; while she,"
1474,IV. ILLICIT,"Perplexed and tired, half told me I must go,--"
1475,IV. ILLICIT,Half asked me if I thought I ought to go . . .
1476,IV. ILLICIT,
1477,IV. ILLICIT,"Well, April passed with many other evenings,"
1478,IV. ILLICIT,"Evenings like this, with later suns and warmer,"
1479,IV. ILLICIT,"With violets always there, and fragrant curtains . . ."
1480,IV. ILLICIT,And she was right: and Miriam found it out . . .
1481,IV. ILLICIT,"And after that, when eight deep years had passed--"
1482,IV. ILLICIT,"Or nine--we met once more,--by accident . . ."
1483,IV. ILLICIT,"But was it just by accident, I wonder,"
1484,IV. ILLICIT,"She played this tune?--Or what, then, was intended? . . ."

1548,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,And the floorless room in which she called you 'friend.'
1549,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"So many times, in doubt, she ran between them!--"
1550,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Through windy corridors of darkening end.
1551,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1552,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Here she could stand with one dim light above her
1553,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"And hear far music, like a sea in caverns,"
1554,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Murmur away at hollowed walls of stone.
1555,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"And here, in a roofless room where it was raining,"
1556,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,She bore the patient sorrow of rain alone.
1557,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1558,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Your words were walls which suddenly froze around her.
1559,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Your words were windows,--large enough for moonlight,"
1560,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Too small to let her through.
1561,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Your letters--fragrant cloisters faint with music.
1562,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,The music that assuaged her there was you.
1563,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1564,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,How many times she heard your step ascending
1565,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Yet never saw your face!
1566,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"She heard them turn again, ring slowly fainter,"
1567,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Till silence swept the place.
1568,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Why had you gone? . . .  The door, perhaps, mistaken . . ."
1569,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,You would go elsewhere.  The deep walls were shaken.
1570,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1571,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,A certain rose-leaf--sent without intention--
1572,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Became, with time, a woven web of fire--"
1573,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"She wore it, and was warm."
1574,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"A certain hurried glance, let fall at parting,"
1575,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Became, with time, the flashings of a storm."
1576,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1577,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Yet, there was nothing asked, no hint to tell you"
1578,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Of secret idols carved in secret chambers
1579,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,From all you did and said.
1580,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Nothing was done, until at last she knew you."
1581,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Nothing was known, till, somehow, she was dead."
1582,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1583,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"How did she die?--You say, she died of poison."
1584,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Simple and swift.  And much to be regretted.
1585,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,You did not see her pass
1586,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"So many thousand times from light to darkness,"
1587,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,Pausing so many times before her glass;
1588,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1589,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,You did not see how many times she hurried
1590,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"To lean from certain windows, vainly hoping,"
1591,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Passionate still for beauty, remembered spring."
1592,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"You did not know how long she clung to music,"
1593,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,You did not hear her sing.
1594,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1595,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Did she, then, make the choice, and step out bravely"
1596,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"From sound to silence--close, herself, those windows?"
1597,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"Or was it true, instead,"
1598,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"That darkness moved,--for once,--and so possessed her? . . ."
1599,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,"We'll never know, you say, for she is dead."
1600,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1601,VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD,
1602,VII. PORCELAIN,VII. PORCELAIN
1603,VII. PORCELAIN,
1604,VII. PORCELAIN,You see that porcelain ranged there in the window--
1605,VII. PORCELAIN,"Platters and soup-plates done with pale pink rosebuds,"
1606,VII. PORCELAIN,"And tiny violets, and wreaths of ivy?"
1607,VII. PORCELAIN,See how the pattern clings to the gleaming edges!
1608,VII. PORCELAIN,"They're works of art--minutely seen and felt,"
1609,VII. PORCELAIN,Each petal done devoutly.  Is it failure
1610,VII. PORCELAIN,To spend your blood like this?
1611,VII. PORCELAIN,
1612,VII. PORCELAIN,"Study them . . . you will see there, in the porcelain,"
1613,VII. PORCELAIN,"If you stare hard enough, a sort of swimming"
1614,VII. PORCELAIN,"Of lights and shadows, ghosts within a crystal--"
1615,VII. PORCELAIN,My brain unfolding!  There you'll see me sitting
1616,VII. PORCELAIN,"Day after day, close to a certain window,"
1617,VII. PORCELAIN,"Looking down, sometimes, to see the people . . ."
1618,VII. PORCELAIN,
1619,VII. PORCELAIN,Sometimes my wife comes there to speak to me . . .
1620,VII. PORCELAIN,Sometimes the grey cat waves his tail around me . . .
1621,VII. PORCELAIN,"Goldfish swim in a bowl, glisten in sunlight,"
1622,VII. PORCELAIN,"Dilate to a gorgeous size, blow delicate bubbles,"
1623,VII. PORCELAIN,"Drowse among dark green weeds.  On rainy days,"
1624,VII. PORCELAIN,You'll see a gas-light shedding light behind me--
1625,VII. PORCELAIN,"An eye-shade round my forehead.  There I sit,"
1626,VII. PORCELAIN,"Twirling the tiny brushes in my paint-cups,"
1627,VII. PORCELAIN,"Painting the pale pink rosebuds, minute violets,"
1628,VII. PORCELAIN,Exquisite wreaths of dark green ivy leaves.
1629,VII. PORCELAIN,"On this leaf, goes a dream I dreamed last night"
1630,VII. PORCELAIN,"Of two soft-patterned toads--I thought them stones,"
1631,VII. PORCELAIN,"Until they hopped!  And then a great black spider,--"
1632,VII. PORCELAIN,"Tarantula, perhaps, a hideous thing,--"
1633,VII. PORCELAIN,It crossed the room in one tremendous leap.
1634,VII. PORCELAIN,"Here,--as I coil the stems between two leaves,--"
1635,VII. PORCELAIN,"It is as if, dwindling to atomy size,"
1636,VII. PORCELAIN,I cried the secret between two universes . . .
1637,VII. PORCELAIN,"A friend of mine took hasheesh once, and said"
1638,VII. PORCELAIN,"Just as he fell asleep he had a dream,--"
1639,VII. PORCELAIN,"Though with his eyes wide open,--"
1640,VII. PORCELAIN,"And felt, or saw, or knew himself a part"
1641,VII. PORCELAIN,"Of marvelous slowly-wreathing intricate patterns,"
1642,VII. PORCELAIN,"Plane upon plane, depth upon coiling depth,"
1643,VII. PORCELAIN,"Amazing leaves, folding one on another,"
1644,VII. PORCELAIN,"Voluted grasses, twists and curves and spirals--"
1645,VII. PORCELAIN,"All of it darkly moving . . . as for me,"
1646,VII. PORCELAIN,I need no hasheesh for it--it's too easy!
1647,VII. PORCELAIN,Soon as I shut my eyes I set out walking
1648,VII. PORCELAIN,"In a monstrous jungle of monstrous pale pink roseleaves,"
1649,VII. PORCELAIN,"Violets purple as death, dripping with water,"
1650,VII. PORCELAIN,And ivy-leaves as big as clouds above me.
1651,VII. PORCELAIN,
1652,VII. PORCELAIN,"Here, in a simple pattern of separate violets--"
1653,VII. PORCELAIN,With scalloped edges gilded--here you have me
1654,VII. PORCELAIN,"Thinking of something else.  My wife, you know,--"
1655,VII. PORCELAIN,"There's something lacking--force, or will, or passion,"
1656,VII. PORCELAIN,"I don't know what it is--and so, sometimes,"
1657,VII. PORCELAIN,"When I am tired, or haven't slept three nights,"
1658,VII. PORCELAIN,"Or it is cloudy, with low threat of rain,"
1659,VII. PORCELAIN,I get uneasy--just like poplar trees
1660,VII. PORCELAIN,Ruffling their leaves--and I begin to think
1661,VII. PORCELAIN,"Of poor Pauline, so many years ago,"
1662,VII. PORCELAIN,And that delicious night.  Where is she now?
1663,VII. PORCELAIN,"I meant to write--but she has moved, by this time,"
1664,VII. PORCELAIN,"And then, besides, she might find out I'm married."
1665,VII. PORCELAIN,"Well, there is more--I'm getting old and timid--"
1666,VII. PORCELAIN,The years have gnawed my will.  I've lost my nerve!
1667,VII. PORCELAIN,I never strike out boldly as I used to--
1668,VII. PORCELAIN,"But sit here, painting violets, and remember"
1669,VII. PORCELAIN,"That thrilling night.  Photographers, she said,"
1670,VII. PORCELAIN,"Asked her to pose for them; her eyes and forehead,--"
1671,VII. PORCELAIN,"Dark brown eyes, and a smooth and pallid forehead,--"
1672,VII. PORCELAIN,Were thought so beautiful.--And so they were.
1673,VII. PORCELAIN,Pauline . . .  These violets are like words remembered . . .
1674,VII. PORCELAIN,Darling! she whispered . . . Darling! . . . Darling! . . . Darling!
1675,VII. PORCELAIN,"Well, I suppose such days can come but once."
1676,VII. PORCELAIN,"Lord, how happy we were! . . ."
1677,VII. PORCELAIN,
1678,VII. PORCELAIN,"Here, if you only knew it, is a story--"
1679,VII. PORCELAIN,"Here, in these leaves.  I stopped my work to tell it,"
1680,VII. PORCELAIN,"And then, when I had finished, went on thinking:"
1681,VII. PORCELAIN,A man I saw on a train . . .  I was still a boy . . .
1682,VII. PORCELAIN,Who killed himself by diving against a wall.
1683,VII. PORCELAIN,"Here is a recollection of my wife,"
1684,VII. PORCELAIN,"When she was still my sweetheart, years ago."
1685,VII. PORCELAIN,"It's funny how things change,--just change, by growing,"
1686,VII. PORCELAIN,"Without an effort . . .  And here are trivial things,--"
1687,VII. PORCELAIN,"A chill, an errand forgotten, a cut while shaving;"
1688,VII. PORCELAIN,A friend of mine who tells me he is married . . .
1689,VII. PORCELAIN,"Or is that last so trivial?  Well, no matter!"
1690,VII. PORCELAIN,
1691,VII. PORCELAIN,"This is the sort of thing you'll see of me,"
1692,VII. PORCELAIN,"If you look hard enough.  This, in its way,"
1693,VII. PORCELAIN,Is a kind of fame.  My life arranged before you
1694,VII. PORCELAIN,"In scrolls of leaves, rosebuds, violets, ivy,"
1695,VII. PORCELAIN,Clustered or wreathed on plate and cup and platter . . .
1696,VII. PORCELAIN,"Sometimes, I say, I'm just like John the Baptist--"
1697,VII. PORCELAIN,You have my head before you . . . on a platter.
1698,VII. PORCELAIN,

1700,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE
1701,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1702,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Wind blows.  Snow falls.  The great clock in its tower
1703,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Ticks with reverberant coil and tolls the hour:
1704,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,At the deep sudden stroke the pigeons fly . . .
1705,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,The fine snow flutes the cracks between the flagstones.
1706,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"We close our coats, and hurry, and search the sky."
1707,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1708,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"We are like music, each voice of it pursuing"
1709,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"A golden separate dream, remote, persistent,"
1710,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Climbing to fire, receding to hoarse despair."
1711,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"What do you whisper, brother?  What do you tell me? . . ."
1712,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"We pass each other, are lost, and do not care."
1713,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1714,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"One mounts up to beauty, serenely singing,"
1715,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Forgetful of the steps that cry behind him;
1716,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,One drifts slowly down from a waking dream.
1717,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"One, foreseeing, lingers forever unmoving . . ."
1718,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Upward and downward, past him there, we stream."
1719,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1720,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,One has death in his eyes: and walks more slowly.
1721,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Death, among jonquils, told him a freezing secret."
1722,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"A cloud blows over his eyes, he ponders earth."
1723,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,He sees in the world a forest of sunlit jonquils:
1724,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,A slow black poison huddles beneath that mirth.
1725,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1726,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Death, from street to alley, from door to window,"
1727,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Cries out his news,--of unplumbed worlds approaching,"
1728,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Of a cloud of darkness soon to destroy the tower.
1729,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"But why comes death,--he asks,--in a world so perfect?"
1730,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Or why the minute's grey in the golden hour?
1731,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1732,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Music, a sudden glissando, sinister, troubled,"
1733,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"A drift of wind-torn petals, before him passes"
1734,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Down jangled streets, and dies."
1735,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"The bodies of old and young, of maimed and lovely,"
1736,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Are slowly borne to earth, with a dirge of cries."
1737,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1738,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Down cobbled streets they come; down huddled stairways;
1739,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Through silent halls; through carven golden doorways;
1740,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,From freezing rooms as bare as rock.
1741,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,The curtains are closed across deserted windows.
1742,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,Earth streams out of the shovel; the pebbles knock.
1743,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1744,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Mary, whose hands rejoiced to move in sunlight;"
1745,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Silent Elaine; grave Anne, who sang so clearly;"
1746,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Fugitive Helen, who loved and walked alone;"
1747,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Miriam too soon dead, darkly remembered;"
1748,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Childless Ruth, who sorrowed, but could not atone;"
1749,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1750,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Jean, whose laughter flashed over depths of terror,"
1751,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"And Eloise, who desired to love but dared not;"
1752,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"Doris, who turned alone to the dark and cried,--"
1753,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"They are blown away like windflung chords of music,"
1754,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,They drift away; the sudden music has died.
1755,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,
1756,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"And one, with death in his eyes, comes walking slowly"
1757,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"And sees the shadow of death in many faces,"
1758,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,And thinks the world is strange.
1759,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,"He desires immortal music and spring forever,"
1760,VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE,And beauty that knows no change.

1764,IX. CABARET,
1765,IX. CABARET,"We sit together and talk, or smoke in silence."
1766,IX. CABARET,You say (but use no words) 'this night is passing
1767,IX. CABARET,As other nights when we are dead will pass . . .'
1768,IX. CABARET,"Perhaps I misconstrue you: you mean only,"
1769,IX. CABARET,'How deathly pale my face looks in that glass . . .'
1770,IX. CABARET,
1771,IX. CABARET,"You say: 'We sit and talk, of things important . . ."
1772,IX. CABARET,"How many others like ourselves, this instant,"
1773,IX. CABARET,Mark the pendulum swinging against the wall?
1774,IX. CABARET,"How many others, laughing, sip their coffee--"
1775,IX. CABARET,"Or stare at mirrors, and do not talk at all? . . ."
1776,IX. CABARET,
1777,IX. CABARET,"'This is the moment' (so you would say, in silence)"
1778,IX. CABARET,When suddenly we have had too much of laughter:
1779,IX. CABARET,"And a freezing stillness falls, no word to say."
1780,IX. CABARET,Our mouths feel foolish . . .  For all the days hereafter
1781,IX. CABARET,"What have we saved--what news, what tune, what play?"
1782,IX. CABARET,
1783,IX. CABARET,"'We see each other as vain and futile tricksters,--"
1784,IX. CABARET,Posturing like bald apes before a mirror;
1785,IX. CABARET,No pity dims our eyes . . .
1786,IX. CABARET,"How many others, like ourselves, this instant,"
1787,IX. CABARET,"See how the great world wizens, and are wise? . . .'"
1788,IX. CABARET,
1789,IX. CABARET,"Well, you are right . . .  No doubt, they fall, these seconds . . ."
1790,IX. CABARET,"When suddenly all's distempered, vacuous, ugly,"
1791,IX. CABARET,And even those most like angels creep for schemes.
1792,IX. CABARET,"The one you love leans forward, smiles, deceives you,"
1793,IX. CABARET,Opens a door through which you see dark dreams.
1794,IX. CABARET,
1795,IX. CABARET,"But this is momentary . . . or else, enduring,"
1796,IX. CABARET,Leads you with devious eyes through mists and poisons
1797,IX. CABARET,"To horrible chaos, or suicide, or crime . . ."
1798,IX. CABARET,And all these others who at your conjuration
1799,IX. CABARET,"Grow pale, feeling the skeleton touch of time,--"
1800,IX. CABARET,
1801,IX. CABARET,"Or, laughing sadly, talk of things important,"
1802,IX. CABARET,"Or stare at mirrors, startled to see their faces,"
1803,IX. CABARET,"Or drown in the waveless vacuum of their days,--"
1804,IX. CABARET,"Suddenly, as from sleep, awake, forgetting"
1805,IX. CABARET,"This nauseous dream; take up their accustomed ways,"
1806,IX. CABARET,
1807,IX. CABARET,"Exhume the ghost of a joke, renew loud laughter,"
1808,IX. CABARET,"Forget the moles above their sweethearts' eyebrows,"
1809,IX. CABARET,"Lean to the music, rise,"
1810,IX. CABARET,And dance once more in a rose-festooned illusion
1811,IX. CABARET,With kindness in their eyes . . .
1812,IX. CABARET,
1813,IX. CABARET,"They say (as we ourselves have said, remember)"
1814,IX. CABARET,'What wizardry this slow waltz works upon us!
1815,IX. CABARET,And how it brings to mind forgotten things!'
1816,IX. CABARET,They say 'How strange it is that one such evening
1817,IX. CABARET,Can wake vague memories of so many springs!'
1818,IX. CABARET,
1819,IX. CABARET,"And so they go . . .  In a thousand crowded places,"
1820,IX. CABARET,"They sit to smile and talk, or rise to ragtime,"
1821,IX. CABARET,"And, for their pleasures, agree or disagree."
1822,IX. CABARET,With secret symbols they play on secret passions.
1823,IX. CABARET,With cunning eyes they see
1824,IX. CABARET,
1825,IX. CABARET,"The innocent word that sets remembrance trembling,"
1826,IX. CABARET,The dubious word that sets the scared heart beating . . .
1827,IX. CABARET,The pendulum on the wall
1828,IX. CABARET,"Shakes down seconds . . .  They laugh at time, dissembling;"
1829,IX. CABARET,Or coil for a victim and do not talk at all.

1834,X. LETTER,"From time to time, lifting his eyes, he sees"
1835,X. LETTER,"The soft blue starlight through the one small window,"
1836,X. LETTER,"The moon above black trees, and clouds, and Venus,--"
1837,X. LETTER,"And turns to write . . .  The clock, behind ticks softly."
1838,X. LETTER,
1839,X. LETTER,"It is so long, indeed, since I have written,--"
1840,X. LETTER,"Two years, almost, your last is turning yellow,--"
1841,X. LETTER,That these first words I write seem cold and strange.
1842,X. LETTER,"Are you the man I knew, or have you altered?"
1843,X. LETTER,"Altered, of course--just as I too have altered--"
1844,X. LETTER,"And whether towards each other, or more apart,"
1845,X. LETTER,We cannot say . . .  I've just re-read your letter--
1846,X. LETTER,"Not through forgetfulness, but more for pleasure--"
1847,X. LETTER,
1848,X. LETTER,Pondering much on all you say in it
1849,X. LETTER,Of mystic consciousness--divine conversion--
1850,X. LETTER,"The sense of oneness with the infinite,--"
1851,X. LETTER,"Faith in the world, its beauty, and its purpose . . ."
1852,X. LETTER,"Well, you believe one must have faith, in some sort,"
1853,X. LETTER,If one's to talk through this dark world contented.
1854,X. LETTER,But is the world so dark?  Or is it rather
1855,X. LETTER,"Our own brute minds,--in which we hurry, trembling,"
1856,X. LETTER,"Through streets as yet unlighted?  This, I think."
1857,X. LETTER,
1858,X. LETTER,"You have been always, let me say, ""romantic,""--"
1859,X. LETTER,"Eager for color, for beauty, soon discontented"
1860,X. LETTER,With a world of dust and stones and flesh too ailing:
1861,X. LETTER,Even before the question grew to problem
1862,X. LETTER,"And drove you bickering into metaphysics,"
1863,X. LETTER,"You met on lower planes the same great dragon,"
1864,X. LETTER,"Seeking release, some fleeting satisfaction,"
1865,X. LETTER,"In strange aesthetics . . .  You tried, as I remember,"
1866,X. LETTER,"One after one, strange cults, and some, too, morbid,"
1867,X. LETTER,"The cruder first, more violent sensations,"
1868,X. LETTER,"Gorgeously carnal things, conceived and acted"
1869,X. LETTER,"With splendid animal thirst . . .  Then, by degrees,--"
1870,X. LETTER,Savoring all more delicate gradations
1871,X. LETTER,
1872,X. LETTER,"In all that hue and tone may play on flesh,"
1873,X. LETTER,"Or thought on brain,--you passed, if I may say so,"
1874,X. LETTER,From red and scarlet through morbid greens to mauve.
1875,X. LETTER,"Let us regard ourselves, you used to say,"
1876,X. LETTER,"As instruments of music, whereon our lives"
1877,X. LETTER,Will play as we desire: and let us yield
1878,X. LETTER,These subtle bodies and subtler brains and nerves
1879,X. LETTER,To all experience plays . . . And so you went
1880,X. LETTER,"From subtle tune to subtler, each heard once,"
1881,X. LETTER,"Twice or thrice at the most, tiring of each;"
1882,X. LETTER,"And closing one by one your doors, drew in"
1883,X. LETTER,"Slowly, through darkening labyrinths of feeling,"
1884,X. LETTER,Towards the central chamber . . .  Which now you've reached.
1885,X. LETTER,
1886,X. LETTER,"What, then's, the secret of this ultimate chamber--"
1887,X. LETTER,"Or innermost, rather?  If I see it clearly"
1888,X. LETTER,"It is the last, and cunningest, resort"
1889,X. LETTER,"Of one who has found this world of dust and flesh,--"
1890,X. LETTER,"This world of lamentations, death, injustice,"
1891,X. LETTER,"Sickness, humiliation, slow defeat,"
1892,X. LETTER,"Bareness, and ugliness, and iteration,--"
1893,X. LETTER,"Too meaningless; or, if it has a meaning,"
1894,X. LETTER,Too tiresomely insistent on one meaning:
1895,X. LETTER,
1896,X. LETTER,"Futility . . .  This world, I hear you saying,--"
1897,X. LETTER,"With lifted chin, and arm in outflung gesture,"
1898,X. LETTER,"Coldly imperious,--this transient world,"
1899,X. LETTER,"What has it then to give, if not containing"
1900,X. LETTER,"Deep hints of nobler worlds?  We know its beauties,--"
1901,X. LETTER,"Momentary and trivial for the most part,"
1902,X. LETTER,"Perceived through flesh, passing like flesh away,--"
1903,X. LETTER,And know how much outweighed they are by darkness.
1904,X. LETTER,"We are like searchers in a house of darkness,"
1905,X. LETTER,"A house of dust; we creep with little lanterns,"
1906,X. LETTER,"Throwing our tremulous arcs of light at random,"
1907,X. LETTER,"Now here, now there, seeing a plane, an angle,"
1908,X. LETTER,"An edge, a curve, a wall, a broken stairway"
1909,X. LETTER,Leading to who knows what; but never seeing
1910,X. LETTER,"The whole at once . . .  We grope our way a little,"
1911,X. LETTER,"And then grow tired.  No matter what we touch,"
1912,X. LETTER,Dust is the answer--dust: dust everywhere.
1913,X. LETTER,"If this were all--what were the use, you ask?"
1914,X. LETTER,"But this is not: for why should we be seeking,"
1915,X. LETTER,"Why should we bring this need to seek for beauty,"
1916,X. LETTER,"To lift our minds, if there were only dust?"
1917,X. LETTER,This is the central chamber you have come to:
1918,X. LETTER,"Turning your back to the world, until you came"
1919,X. LETTER,"To this deep room, and looked through rose-stained windows,"
1920,X. LETTER,And saw the hues of the world so sweetly changed.
1921,X. LETTER,
1922,X. LETTER,"Well, in a measure, so only do we all."
1923,X. LETTER,I am not sure that you can be refuted.
1924,X. LETTER,"At the very last we all put faith in something,--"
1925,X. LETTER,"You in this ghost that animates your world,"
1926,X. LETTER,"This ethical ghost,--and I, you'll say, in reason,--"
1927,X. LETTER,"Or sensuous beauty,--or in my secret self . . ."
1928,X. LETTER,"Though as for that you put your faith in these,"
1929,X. LETTER,"As much as I do--and then, forsaking reason,--"
1930,X. LETTER,"Ascending, you would say, to intuition,--"
1931,X. LETTER,"You predicate this ghost of yours, as well."
1932,X. LETTER,"Of course, you might have argued,--and you should have,--"
1933,X. LETTER,That no such deep appearance of design
1934,X. LETTER,Could shape our world without entailing purpose:
1935,X. LETTER,For can design exist without a purpose?
1936,X. LETTER,Without conceiving mind? . . .  We are like children
1937,X. LETTER,"Who find, upon the sands, beside a sea,"
1938,X. LETTER,"Strange patterns drawn,--circles, arcs, ellipses,"
1939,X. LETTER,"Moulded in sand . . .  Who put them there, we wonder?"
1940,X. LETTER,
1941,X. LETTER,Did someone draw them here before we came?
1942,X. LETTER,"Or was it just the sea?--We pore upon them,"
1943,X. LETTER,But find no answer--only suppositions.
1944,X. LETTER,And if these perfect shapes are evidence
1945,X. LETTER,"Of immanent mind, it is but circumstantial:"
1946,X. LETTER,"We never come upon him at his work,"
1947,X. LETTER,He never troubles us.  He stands aloof--
1948,X. LETTER,"Well, if he stands at all: is not concerned"
1949,X. LETTER,"With what we are or do.  You, if you like,"
1950,X. LETTER,"May think he broods upon us, loves us, hates us,"
1951,X. LETTER,Conceives some purpose of us.  In so doing
1952,X. LETTER,"You see, without much reason, will in law."
1953,X. LETTER,"I am content to say, 'this world is ordered,"
1954,X. LETTER,"Happily so for us, by accident:"
1955,X. LETTER,We go our ways untroubled save by laws
1956,X. LETTER,Of natural things.'  Who makes the more assumption?
1957,X. LETTER,
1958,X. LETTER,If we were wise--which God knows we are not--
1959,X. LETTER,(Notice I call on God!) we'd plumb this riddle
1960,X. LETTER,"Not in the world we see, but in ourselves."
1961,X. LETTER,These brains of ours--these delicate spinal clusters--
1962,X. LETTER,"Have limits: why not learn them, learn their cravings?"
1963,X. LETTER,"Which of the two minds, yours or mine, is sound?"
1964,X. LETTER,"Yours, which scorned the world that gave it freedom,"
1965,X. LETTER,"Until you managed to see that world as omen,--"
1966,X. LETTER,"Or mine, which likes the world, takes all for granted,"
1967,X. LETTER,"Sorrow as much as joy, and death as life?--"
1968,X. LETTER,"You lean on dreams, and take more credit for it."
1969,X. LETTER,"I stand alone . . .  Well, I take credit, too."
1970,X. LETTER,You find your pleasure in being at one with all things--
1971,X. LETTER,"Fusing in lambent dream, rising and falling"
1972,X. LETTER,As all things rise and fall . . .  I do that too--
1973,X. LETTER,With reservations.  I find more varied pleasure
1974,X. LETTER,In understanding: and so find beauty even
1975,X. LETTER,In this strange dream of yours you call the truth.
1976,X. LETTER,
1977,X. LETTER,"Well, I have bored you.  And it's growing late."
1978,X. LETTER,"For household news--what have you heard, I wonder?"
1979,X. LETTER,"You must have heard that Paul was dead, by this time--"
1980,X. LETTER,Of spinal cancer.  Nothing could be done--
1981,X. LETTER,"We found it out too late.  His death has changed me,"
1982,X. LETTER,"Deflected much of me that lived as he lived,"
1983,X. LETTER,"Saddened me, slowed me down.  Such things will happen,"
1984,X. LETTER,Life is composed of them; and it seems wisdom
1985,X. LETTER,"To see them clearly, meditate upon them,"
1986,X. LETTER,And understand what things flow out of them.
1987,X. LETTER,"Otherwise, all goes on here much as always."
1988,X. LETTER,"Why won't you come and see us, in the spring,"
1989,X. LETTER,And bring old times with you?--If you could see me
1990,X. LETTER,"Sitting here by the window, watching Venus"
1991,X. LETTER,"Go down behind my neighbor's poplar branches,--"
1992,X. LETTER,"Just where you used to sit,--I'm sure you'd come."
1993,X. LETTER,"This year, they say, the springtime will be early."

1999,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,You narrow your long dark eyes to fascinate me;
2000,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"You smile a little. . . . Outside, the night goes by."
2001,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,I walk alone in a forest of ghostly trees . . .
2002,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Your pale hands rest palm downwards on your knees.
2003,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2004,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"'These lines--converging, they suggest such distance!"
2005,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"The soul is drawn away, beyond horizons."
2006,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Lured out to what?  One dares not think.
2007,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Sometimes, I glimpse these infinite perspectives"
2008,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,In intimate talk (with such as you) and shrink . . .
2009,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2010,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,'One feels so petty!--One feels such--emptiness!--'
2011,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"You mimic horror, let fall your lifted hand,"
2012,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,And smile at me; with brooding tenderness . . .
2013,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Alone on darkened waters I fall and rise;
2014,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Slow waves above me break, faint waves of cries."
2015,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2016,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,'And then these colors . . . but who would dare describe them?
2017,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,This faint rose-coral pink . . this green--pistachio?--
2018,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,So insubstantial!  Like the dim ghostly things
2019,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Two lovers find in love's still-twilight chambers . . .
2020,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Old peacock-fans, and fragrant silks, and rings . . ."

2022,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"'Rings, let us say, drawn from the hapless fingers"
2023,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Of some great lady, many centuries nameless,--"
2024,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Or is that too sepulchral?--dulled with dust;
2025,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,And necklaces that crumble if you touch them;
2026,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"And gold brocades that, breathed on, fall to rust."
2027,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2028,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,'No--I am wrong . . . it is not these I sought for--!
2029,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Why did they come to mind?  You understand me--
2030,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,You know these strange vagaries of the brain!--'
2031,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,--I walk alone in a forest of ghostly trees;
2032,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Your pale hands rest palm downwards on your knees;
2033,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,These strange vagaries of yours are all too plain.
2034,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2035,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,'But why perplex ourselves with tedious problems
2036,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Of art or . . . such things? . . . while we sit here, living,"
2037,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,With all that's in our secret hearts to say!--'
2038,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Hearts?--Your pale hand softly strokes the satin.
2039,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,You play deep music--know well what you play.
2040,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"You stroke the satin with thrilling of finger-tips,"
2041,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"You smile, with faintly perfumed lips,"
2042,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"You loose your thoughts like birds,"
2043,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Brushing our dreams with soft and shadowy words . .
2044,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"We know your words are foolish, yet sit here bound"
2045,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,In tremulous webs of sound.
2046,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2047,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,'How beautiful is intimate talk like this!--
2048,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"It is as if we dissolved grey walls between us,"

2051,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Lean to a giant size on the windy walls,"

2054,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Music sings far off, flows suddenly near,"
2055,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,And dies away like rain . . .
2056,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"We walk through subterranean caves again,--"
2057,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Vaguely above us feeling
2058,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"A shadowy weight of frescos on the ceiling,"
2059,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Strange half-lit things,"
2060,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Soundless grotesques with writhing claws and wings . . .
2061,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,And here a beautiful face looks down upon us;
2062,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"And someone hurries before, unseen, and sings . . ."
2063,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Have we seen all, I wonder, in these chambers--"
2064,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"Or is there yet some gorgeous vault, arched low,"
2065,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Where sleeps an amazing beauty we do not know? . . '
2066,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,
2067,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"The question falls: we walk in silence together,"
2068,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Thinking of that deep vault and of its secret . . .
2069,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,"This lamp, these books, this fire"
2070,XI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES,Are suddenly blown away in a whistling darkness.

2077,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And the cold clear dark of starlight fell,"
2078,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,He heard in his blood the well-known bell
2079,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Tolling slowly in heaves of sound,"
2080,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Slowly beating, slowly beating,"
2081,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Shaking its pulse on the stagnant air:
2082,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Sometimes it swung completely round,"
2083,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Horribly gasping as if for breath;
2084,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Falling down with an anguished cry . . .
2085,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Now the red bat, he mused, will fly;"
2086,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Something is marked, this night, for death . . ."
2087,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And while he mused, along his blood"
2088,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Flew ghostly voices, remote and thin,"
2089,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They rose in the cavern of his brain,"
2090,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Like ghosts they died away again;
2091,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And hands upon his heart were laid,"
2092,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And music upon his flesh was played,"
2093,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Until, as he was bidden to do,"
2094,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,He walked the wood he so well knew.
2095,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Through the cold dew he moved his feet,"
2096,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And heard far off, as under the earth,"
2097,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Discordant music in shuddering tones,"
2098,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Screams of laughter, horrible mirth,"
2099,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Clapping of hands, and thudding of drums,"
2100,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,And the long-drawn wail of one in pain.
2101,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"To-night, he thought, I shall die again,"
2102,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,We shall die again in the red-eyed fire
2103,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,To meet on the edge of the wood beyond
2104,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,With the placid gaze of fed desire . . .
2105,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"He walked; and behind the whisper of trees,"
2106,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"In and out, one walked with him:"
2107,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"She parted the branches and peered at him,"
2108,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Through lowered lids her two eyes burned,"
2109,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"He heard her breath, he saw her hand,"
2110,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Wherever he turned his way, she turned:"
2111,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Kept pace with him, now fast, now slow;"
2112,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Moving her white knees as he moved . . .
2113,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,This is the one I have always loved;
2114,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,This is the one whose bat-soul comes
2115,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"To dance with me, flesh to flesh,"
2116,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,In the starlight dance of horns and drums . . .
2117,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,
2118,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The walls and roofs, the scarlet towers,"
2119,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Sank down behind a rushing sky.
2120,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,He heard a sweet song just begun
2121,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Abruptly shatter in tones and die.
2122,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,It whirled away.  Cold silence fell.
2123,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,And again came tollings of a bell.

2128,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Swifter than smoke on the starlit wind.
2129,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"In the clear darkness, while the moon hides,"
2130,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They come like dreams, like something remembered . ."
2131,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Let us hurry! beloved; take my hand,"
2132,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Forget these things that trouble your eyes,"
2133,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Forget, forget!  Our flesh is changed,"
2134,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Lighter than smoke we wreathe and rise . . .
2135,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,
2136,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The cold air hisses between us . . . Beloved, beloved,"
2137,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,What was the word you said?
2138,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Something about clear music that sang through water . . .
2139,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,I cannot remember.  The storm-drops break on the leaves.
2140,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Something was lost in the darkness.  Someone is dead.
2141,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Someone lies in the garden and grieves.
2142,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Look how the branches are tossed in this air,"
2143,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Flinging their green to the earth!
2144,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Black clouds rush to devour the stars in the sky,"
2145,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,The moon stares down like a half-closed eye.
2146,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The leaves are scattered, the birds are blown,"
2147,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Oaks crash down in the darkness,"

2154,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Like a thing of smoke it crossed the sky,"
2155,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The witch! he said.  And he heard a cry,"
2156,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And another came, and another came,"
2157,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And one, grown duskily red with blood,"
2158,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Floated an instant across the moon,"
2159,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Hung like a dull fantastic flame . . .
2160,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The earth has veins: they throb to-night,"
2161,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The earth swells warm beneath my feet,"
2162,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The tips of the trees grow red and bright,"
2163,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The leaves are swollen, I feel them beat,"
2164,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They press together, they push and sigh,"
2165,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They listen to hear the great bat cry,"
2166,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,The great red bat with the woman's face . . .
2167,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Hurry! he said.  And pace for pace
2168,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"That other, who trod the dark with him,"
2169,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Crushed the live leaves, reached out white hands"
2170,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And closed her eyes, the better to see"
2171,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The priests with claws, the lovers with hooves,"
2172,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The fire-lit rock, the sarabands."
2173,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,I am here! she said.  The bough he broke--
2174,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Was it the snapping bough that spoke?
2175,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,I am here! she said.  The white thigh gleamed
2176,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Cold in starlight among dark leaves,"
2177,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The head thrown backward as he had dreamed,"
2178,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,The shadowy red deep jasper mouth;
2179,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And the lifted hands, and the virgin breasts,"
2180,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Passed beside him, and vanished away."
2181,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,I am here! she cried.  He answered 'Stay!'
2182,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"And laughter arose, and near and far"
2183,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Answering laughter rose and died . . .
2184,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Who is there? in the dark? he cried.
2185,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"He stood in terror, and heard a sound"
2186,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Of terrible hooves on the hollow ground;
2187,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They rushed, were still; a silence fell;"
2188,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,And he heard deep tollings of a bell.
2189,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,
2190,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,*     *     *     *     *
2191,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,
2192,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Look beloved!  Why do you hide your face?
2193,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Look, in the centre there, above the fire,"
2194,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,They are bearing the boy who blasphemed love!
2195,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,They are playing a piercing music upon him
2196,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,With a bow of living wire! . . .
2197,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"The virgin harlot sings,"
2198,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"She leans above the beautiful anguished body,"
2199,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,And draws slow music from those strings.
2200,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They dance around him, they fling red roses upon him,"
2201,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They trample him with their naked feet,"
2202,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"His cries are lost in laughter,"
2203,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Their feet grow dark with his blood, they beat and"

2205,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"They dance upon him, until he cries no more . . ."
2206,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,Have we not heard that cry before?
2207,XII. WITCHES' SABBATH,"Somewhere, somewhere,"

2529,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,
2530,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,. . . . She falls.  We lift her head.  The wasted body
2531,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,Weighs nothing in our hands.  Does no one know her?
2532,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,Was no one with her when she fell? . . .
2533,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,"We eddy about her, move away in silence."
2534,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,We hear slow tollings of a bell.
2535,II. DEATH: AND A DERISIVE CHORUS,

2537,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT
2538,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2539,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Well, as you say, we live for small horizons:"
2540,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"We move in crowds, we flow and talk together,"
2541,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Seeing so many eyes and hands and faces,"
2542,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"So many mouths, and all with secret meanings,--"
2543,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Yet know so little of them; only seeing
2544,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The small bright circle of our consciousness,"
2545,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Beyond which lies the dark.  Some few we know--
2546,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or think we know. . .  Once, on a sun-bright morning,"
2547,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I walked in a certain hallway, trying to find"
2548,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"A certain door: I found one, tried it, opened,"
2549,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And there in a spacious chamber, brightly lighted,"
2550,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"A hundred men played music, loudly, swiftly,"
2551,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,While one tall woman sent her voice above them
2552,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,In powerful sweetness. . . . Closing then the door
2553,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I heard it die behind me, fade to whisper,--"
2554,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And walked in a quiet hallway as before.
2555,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Just such a glimpse, as through that opened door,"
2556,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Is all we know of those we call our friends. . . .
2557,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"We hear a sudden music, see a playing"
2558,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Of ordered thoughts--and all again is silence.
2559,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The music, we suppose, (as in ourselves)"
2560,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Goes on forever there, behind shut doors,--"
2561,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"As it continues after our departure,"
2562,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"So, we divine, it played before we came . . ."
2563,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"What do you know of me, or I of you? . . ."
2564,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Little enough. . . . We set these doors ajar
2565,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Only for chosen movements of the music:
2566,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This passage, (so I think--yet this is guesswork)"
2567,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Will please him,--it is in a strain he fancies,--"
2568,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"More brilliant, though, than his; and while he likes it"
2569,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,He will be piqued . . . He looks at me bewildered
2570,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And thinks (to judge from self--this too is guesswork)
2571,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2572,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The music strangely subtle, deep in meaning,"
2573,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Perplexed with implications; he suspects me
2574,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of hidden riches, unexpected wisdom. . . ."
2575,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or else I let him hear a lyric passage,--"
2576,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Simple and clear; and all the while he listens
2577,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,I make pretence to think my doors are closed.
2578,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,This too bewilders him.  He eyes me sidelong
2579,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Wondering 'Is he such a fool as this?
2580,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Or only mocking?'--There I let it end. . . .
2581,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Sometimes, of course, and when we least suspect it--"
2582,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"When we pursue our thoughts with too much passion,"
2583,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Talking with too great zeal--our doors fly open
2584,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Without intention; and the hungry watcher
2585,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Stares at the feast, carries away our secrets,"
2586,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And laughs. . . . but this, for many counts, is seldom."
2587,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And for the most part we vouchsafe our friends,"
2588,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Our lovers too, only such few clear notes"
2589,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,As we shall deem them likely to admire:
2590,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"'Praise me for this' we say, or 'laugh at this,'"
2591,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Or 'marvel at my candor'. . . . all the while
2592,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Withholding what's most precious to ourselves,--"
2593,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Some sinister depth of lust or fear or hatred,"
2594,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,The sombre note that gives the chord its power;
2595,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Or a white loveliness--if such we know--
2596,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Too much like fire to speak of without shame.
2597,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2598,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Well, this being so, and we who know it being"
2599,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"So curious about those well-locked houses,"
2600,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The minds of those we know,--to enter softly,"
2601,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And steal from floor to floor up shadowy stairways,"
2602,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"From room to quiet room, from wall to wall,"
2603,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Breathing deliberately the very air,"
2604,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Pressing our hands and nerves against warm darkness
2605,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"To learn what ghosts are there,--"
2606,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Suppose for once I set my doors wide open
2607,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And bid you in. . . . Suppose I try to tell you
2608,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The secrets of this house, and how I live here;"
2609,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Suppose I tell you who I am, in fact. . . ."
2610,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Deceiving you--as far as I may know it--
2611,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Only so much as I deceive myself.
2612,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2613,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,If you are clever you already see me
2614,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,As one who moves forever in a cloud
2615,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Of warm bright vanity: a luminous cloud
2616,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Which falls on all things with a quivering magic,"
2617,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Changing such outlines as a light may change,"
2618,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Brightening what lies dark to me, concealing"
2619,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Those things that will not change . . . I walk sustained
2620,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,In a world of things that flatter me: a sky
2621,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Just as I would have had it; trees and grass
2622,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Just as I would have shaped and colored them;
2623,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Pigeons and clouds and sun and whirling shadows,"
2624,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And stars that brightening climb through mist at nightfall,--"
2625,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,In some deep way I am aware these praise me:
2626,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Where they are beautiful, or hint of beauty,"
2627,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"They point, somehow, to me. . . . This water says,--"
2628,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Shimmering at the sky, or undulating"
2629,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"In broken gleaming parodies of clouds,"
2630,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Rippled in blue, or sending from cool depths"
2631,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"To meet the falling leaf the leaf's clear image,--"
2632,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This water says, there is some secret in you"
2633,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Akin to my clear beauty, silently responsive"
2634,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"To all that circles you.  This bare tree says,--"
2635,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Austere and stark and leafless, split with frost,"
2636,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Resonant in the wind, with rigid branches"
2637,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Flung out against the sky,--this tall tree says,"
2638,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"There is some cold austerity in you,"
2639,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"A frozen strength, with long roots gnarled on rocks,"
2640,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Fertile and deep; you bide your time, are patient,"
2641,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Serene in silence, bare to outward seeming,"
2642,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Concealing what reserves of power and beauty!
2643,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,What teeming Aprils!--chorus of leaves on leaves!
2644,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"These houses say, such walls in walls as ours,"
2645,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Such streets of walls, solid and smooth of surface,"
2646,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Such hills and cities of walls, walls upon walls;"
2647,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Motionless in the sun, or dark with rain;"
2648,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Walls pierced with windows, where the light may enter;"
2649,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Walls windowless where darkness is desired;
2650,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Towers and labyrinths and domes and chambers,--"
2651,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Amazing deep recesses, dark on dark,--"
2652,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,All these are like the walls which shape your spirit:
2653,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"You move, are warm, within them, laugh within them,"
2654,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Proud of their depth and strength; or sally from them,"
2655,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"When you are bold, to blow great horns at the world. ."
2656,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This deep cool room, with shadowed walls and ceiling,"
2657,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Tranquil and cloistral, fragrant of my mind,"
2658,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This cool room says,--just such a room have you,"
2659,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"It waits you always at the tops of stairways,"
2660,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Withdrawn, remote, familiar to your uses,"
2661,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Where you may cease pretence and be yourself. . . .
2662,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And this embroidery, hanging on this wall,"
2663,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Hung there forever,--these so soundless glidings"
2664,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of dragons golden-scaled, sheer birds of azure,"
2665,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Coilings of leaves in pale vermilion, griffins"
2666,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Drawing their rainbow wings through involutions
2667,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of mauve chrysanthemums and lotus flowers,--"
2668,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This goblin wood where someone cries enchantment,--"
2669,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This says, just such an involuted beauty"
2670,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of thought and coiling thought, dream linked with dream,"
2671,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Image to image gliding, wreathing fires,"
2672,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Soundlessly cries enchantment in your mind:
2673,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,You need but sit and close your eyes a moment
2674,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,To see these deep designs unfold themselves.
2675,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2676,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And so, all things discern me, name me, praise me--"
2677,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I walk in a world of silent voices, praising;"
2678,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And in this world you see me like a wraith
2679,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Blown softly here and there, on silent winds."
2680,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"'Praise me'--I say; and look, not in a glass,"
2681,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"But in your eyes, to see my image there--"
2682,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or in your mind; you smile, I am contented;"
2683,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"You look at me, with interest unfeigned,"
2684,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And listen--I am pleased; or else, alone,"
2685,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,I watch thin bubbles veering brightly upward
2686,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"From unknown depths,--my silver thoughts ascending;"
2687,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Saying now this, now that, hinting of all things,--"
2688,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Dreams, and desires, velleities, regrets,"
2689,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Faint ghosts of memory, strange recognitions,--"
2690,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"But all with one deep meaning: this is I,"
2691,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This is the glistening secret holy I,"
2692,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This silver-winged wonder, insubstantial,"
2693,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This singing ghost. . . . And hearing, I am warmed."
2694,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2695,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,*     *     *     *     *
2696,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2697,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"You see me moving, then, as one who moves"
2698,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Forever at the centre of his circle:
2699,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,A circle filled with light.  And into it
2700,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Come bulging shapes from darkness, loom gigantic,"
2701,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or huddle in dark again. . . . A clock ticks clearly,"
2702,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"A gas-jet steadily whirs, light streams across me;"
2703,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Two church bells, with alternate beat, strike nine;"
2704,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And through these things my pencil pushes softly
2705,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,To weave grey webs of lines on this clear page.
2706,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Snow falls and melts; the eaves make liquid music;
2707,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Black wheel-tracks line the snow-touched street; I turn
2708,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And look one instant at the half-dark gardens,"
2709,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Where skeleton elm-trees reach with frozen gesture
2710,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Above unsteady lamps,--with black boughs flung"
2711,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Against a luminous snow-filled grey-gold sky.
2712,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"'Beauty!' I cry. . . . My feet move on, and take me"
2713,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Between dark walls, with orange squares for windows."
2714,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Beauty; beheld like someone half-forgotten,"
2715,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Remembered, with slow pang, as one neglected . . ."
2716,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Well, I am frustrate; life has beaten me,"
2717,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The thing I strongly seized has turned to darkness,"
2718,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And darkness rides my heart. . . . These skeleton elm-trees--
2719,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Leaning against that grey-gold snow filled sky--
2720,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Beauty! they say, and at the edge of darkness"
2721,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Extend vain arms in a frozen gesture of protest . . .
2722,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,A clock ticks softly; a gas-jet steadily whirs:
2723,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The pencil meets its shadow upon clear paper,"
2724,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Voices are raised, a door is slammed.  The lovers,"
2725,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Murmuring in an adjacent room, grow silent,"
2726,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The eaves make liquid music. . . . Hours have passed,"
2727,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And nothing changes, and everything is changed."
2728,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Exultation is dead, Beauty is harlot,--"
2729,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And walks the streets.  The thing I strongly seized
2730,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Has turned to darkness, and darkness rides my heart."
2731,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2732,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,If you could solve this darkness you would have me.
2733,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This causeless melancholy that comes with rain,"
2734,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Or on such days as this when large wet snowflakes
2735,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Drop heavily, with rain . . . whence rises this?"
2736,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Well, so-and-so, this morning when I saw him,"
2737,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Seemed much preoccupied, and would not smile;"
2738,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And you, I saw too much; and you, too little;"
2739,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And the word I chose for you, the golden word,"
2740,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The word that should have struck so deep in purpose,"
2741,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And set so many doors of wish wide open,"
2742,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"You let it fall, and would not stoop for it,"
2743,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And smiled at me, and would not let me guess"
2744,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Whether you saw it fall. . . These things, together,"
2745,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"With other things, still slighter, wove to music,"
2746,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And this in time drew up dark memories;
2747,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And there I stand.  This music breaks and bleeds me,"
2748,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Turning all frustrate dreams to chords and discords,"
2749,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Faces and griefs, and words, and sunlit evenings,"
2750,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And chains self-forged that will not break nor lengthen,"
2751,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And cries that none can answer, few will hear."
2752,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Have these things meaning?  Or would you see more clearly
2753,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"If I should say 'My second wife grows tedious,"
2754,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or, like gay tulip, keeps no perfumed secret'?"
2755,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2756,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or 'one day dies eventless as another,"
2757,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Leaving the seeker still unsatisfied,"
2758,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And more convinced life yields no satisfaction'?
2759,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Or 'seek too hard, the sight at length grows callous,"
2760,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And beauty shines in vain'?--
2761,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2762,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"These things you ask for,"
2763,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"These you shall have. . . So, talking with my first wife,"
2764,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"At the dark end of evening, when she leaned"
2765,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And smiled at me, with blue eyes weaving webs"
2766,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of finest fire, revolving me in scarlet,--"
2767,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Calling to mind remote and small successions
2768,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Of countless other evenings ending so,--"
2769,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I smiled, and met her kiss, and wished her dead;"
2770,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Dead of a sudden sickness, or by my hands"
2771,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Savagely killed; I saw her in her coffin,"
2772,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I saw her coffin borne downstairs with trouble,"
2773,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"I saw myself alone there, palely watching,"
2774,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Wearing a masque of grief so deeply acted
2775,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"That grief itself possessed me.  Time would pass,"
2776,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And I should meet this girl,--my second wife--"
2777,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And drop the masque of grief for one of passion.
2778,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Forward we move to meet, half hesitating,"
2779,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"We drown in each others' eyes, we laugh, we talk,"
2780,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Looking now here, now there, faintly pretending"
2781,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,We do not hear the powerful pulsing prelude
2782,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Roaring beneath our words . . . The time approaches.
2783,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"We lean unbalanced.  The mute last glance between us,"
2784,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Profoundly searching, opening, asking, yielding,"
2785,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Is steadily met: our two lives draw together . . .
2786,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,. . . .'What are you thinking of?'. . . . My first wife's voice
2787,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Scattered these ghosts.  'Oh nothing--nothing much--
2788,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Just wondering where we'd be two years from now,"
2789,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And what we might be doing . . . ' And then remorse
2790,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Turned sharply in my mind to sudden pity,"
2791,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And pity to echoed love.  And one more evening
2792,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Drew to the usual end of sleep and silence.
2793,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2794,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And, as it is with this, so too with all things."
2795,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,The pages of our lives are blurred palimpsest:
2796,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"New lines are wreathed on old lines half-erased,"
2797,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,And those on older still; and so forever.
2798,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The old shines through the new, and colors it."
2799,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"What's new?  What's old?  All things have double meanings,--"
2800,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,All things return.  I write a line with passion
2801,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"(Or touch a woman's hand, or plumb a doctrine)"
2802,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Only to find the same thing, done before,--"
2803,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Only to know the same thing comes to-morrow. . . .
2804,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This curious riddled dream I dreamed last night,--"
2805,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Six years ago I dreamed it just as now;
2806,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The same man stooped to me; we rose from darkness,"
2807,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And broke the accustomed order of our days,"
2808,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And struck for the morning world, and warmth, and freedom. . . ."
2809,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,What does it mean?  Why is this hint repeated?
2810,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"What darkness does it spring from, seek to end?"
2811,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,
2812,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"You see me, then, pass up and down these stairways,"
2813,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Now through a beam of light, and now through shadow,--"
2814,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Pursuing silent ends.  No rest there is,--"
2815,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"No more for me than you.  I move here always,"
2816,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"From quiet room to room, from wall to wall,"
2817,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Searching and plotting, weaving a web of days."
2818,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"This is my house, and now, perhaps, you know me. . ."
2819,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"Yet I confess, for all my best intentions,"
2820,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,Once more I have deceived you. . . . I withhold
2821,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"The one thing precious, the one dark thing that guides me;"
2822,III. PALIMPSEST: A DECEITFUL PORTRAIT,"And I have spread two snares for you, of lies."

2831,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"She, by the window, smiles at a starlight night,"
2832,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,
2833,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,His watch--the same he has heard these cycles of ages--
2834,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Wearily chimes at seconds beneath his pillow.
2835,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"The clock, upon her mantelpiece, strikes nine."
2836,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,The night wears on.  She hears dull steps above her.
2837,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,The world whirs on. . . . New stars come up to shine.
2838,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,
2839,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,His youth--far off--he sees it brightly walking
2840,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,In a golden cloud. . . . Wings flashing about it. . . . Darkness
2841,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Walls it around with dripping enormous walls.
2842,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Old age--far off--her death--what do they matter?
2843,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Down the smooth purple night a streaked star falls.
2844,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,
2845,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,She hears slow steps in the street--they chime like music;
2846,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"They climb to her heart, they break and flower in beauty,"
2847,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Along her veins they glisten and ring and burn. . . .
2848,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,He hears his own slow steps tread down to silence.
2849,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Far off they pass.  He knows they will never return.
2850,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,
2851,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Far off--on a smooth dark road--he hears them faintly.
2852,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"The road, like a sombre river, quietly flowing,"
2853,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Moves among murmurous walls.  A deeper breath
2854,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Swells them to sound: he hears his steps more clearly.
2855,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,And death seems nearer to him: or he to death.
2856,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,
2857,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,What's death?--She smiles.  The cool stone hurts her elbows.

2867,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,Under the lamp a circle of wet street gleams. . . .
2868,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"And death seems far away, a thing of roses,"
2869,IV. COUNTERPOINT: TWO ROOMS,"A golden portal, where golden music closes,"

2889,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"No, if I tell at all, I shall tell in silence . . ."
2890,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,I'll say--my childhood broke through chords of music
2891,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"--Or were they chords of sun?--wherein fell shadows,"
2892,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,Or silences; I rose through seas of sunlight;
2893,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,Or sometimes found a darkness stooped above me
2894,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"With wings of death, and a face of cold clear beauty. ."

2909,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"No, I shall not say 'this is why I praise you--"

2941,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"These presences. . . . I drowse, they stream above me,"
2942,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,"I struggle, I yield and love, I am warmed to dream."
2943,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,
2944,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,You are the window (if I could tell I'd tell you)
2945,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,Through which I see a clear far world of sunlight.
2946,V. THE BITTER LOVE-SONG,You are the silence (if you could hear you'd hear me)

2959,VI. CINEMA,"Moving like music, secret and rich and warm."
2960,VI. CINEMA,"How shall we live to-night, where shall we turn?"
2961,VI. CINEMA,To what new light or darkness yearn?
2962,VI. CINEMA,A thousand winding stairs lead down before us;
2963,VI. CINEMA,And one by one in myriads we descend
2964,VI. CINEMA,"By lamplit flowered walls, long balustrades,"
2965,VI. CINEMA,Through half-lit halls which reach no end. . . .
2966,VI. CINEMA,
2967,VI. CINEMA,"Take my arm, then, you or you or you,"
2968,VI. CINEMA,And let us walk abroad on the solid air:
2969,VI. CINEMA,"Look how the organist's head, in silhouette,"
2970,VI. CINEMA,Leans to the lamplit music's orange square! . . .
2971,VI. CINEMA,"The dim-globed lamps illumine rows of faces,"

2974,VI. CINEMA,From windy chambers next to the skies. . . .
2975,VI. CINEMA,"The music comes upon us. . . . it shakes the darkness,"
2976,VI. CINEMA,It shakes the darkness in our minds. . . .
2977,VI. CINEMA,"And brilliant figures suddenly fill the darkness,"
2978,VI. CINEMA,"Down the white shaft of light they run through darkness,"
2979,VI. CINEMA,And in our hearts a dazzling dream unwinds . . .
2980,VI. CINEMA,
2981,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand, then, walk with me"
2982,VI. CINEMA,By the slow soundless crashings of a sea
2983,VI. CINEMA,"Down miles on miles of glistening mirrorlike sand,--"
2984,VI. CINEMA,Take my hand
2985,VI. CINEMA,And walk with me once more by crumbling walls;
2986,VI. CINEMA,"Up mouldering stairs where grey-stemmed ivy clings,"
2987,VI. CINEMA,"To hear forgotten bells, as evening falls,"
2988,VI. CINEMA,Rippling above us invisibly their slowly widening rings. . . .
2989,VI. CINEMA,Did you once love me?  Did you bear a name?
2990,VI. CINEMA,Did you once stand before me without shame? . . .
2991,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand: your face is one I know,"
2992,VI. CINEMA,"I loved you, long ago:"
2993,VI. CINEMA,"You are like music, long forgotten, suddenly come to mind;"
2994,VI. CINEMA,You are like spring returned through snow.
2995,VI. CINEMA,"Once, I know, I walked with you in starlight,"
2996,VI. CINEMA,And many nights I slept and dreamed of you;
2997,VI. CINEMA,"Come, let us climb once more these stairs of starlight,"
2998,VI. CINEMA,This midnight stream of cloud-flung blue! . . .
2999,VI. CINEMA,"Music murmurs beneath us like a sea,"
3000,VI. CINEMA,And faints to a ghostly whisper . . . Come with me.
3001,VI. CINEMA,
3002,VI. CINEMA,"Are you still doubtful of me--hesitant still,"
3003,VI. CINEMA,"Fearful, perhaps, that I may yet remember"
3004,VI. CINEMA,"What you would gladly, if you could, forget?"
3005,VI. CINEMA,"You were unfaithful once, you met your lover;"
3006,VI. CINEMA,Still in your heart you bear that red-eyed ember;
3007,VI. CINEMA,"And I was silent,--you remember my silence yet . . ."
3008,VI. CINEMA,"You knew, as well as I, I could not kill him,"
3009,VI. CINEMA,"Nor touch him with hot hands, nor yet with hate."
3010,VI. CINEMA,"No, and it was not you I saw with anger."
3011,VI. CINEMA,"Instead, I rose and beat at steel-walled fate,"
3012,VI. CINEMA,"Cried till I lay exhausted, sick, unfriended,"
3013,VI. CINEMA,"That life, so seeming sure, and love, so certain,"
3014,VI. CINEMA,"Should loose such tricks, be so abruptly ended,"
3015,VI. CINEMA,Ring down so suddenly an unlooked-for curtain.
3016,VI. CINEMA,
3017,VI. CINEMA,"How could I find it in my heart to hurt you,"
3018,VI. CINEMA,"You, whom this love could hurt much more than I?"
3019,VI. CINEMA,"No, you were pitiful, and I gave you pity;"
3020,VI. CINEMA,And only hated you when I saw you cry.
3021,VI. CINEMA,"We were two dupes; if I could give forgiveness,--"
3022,VI. CINEMA,"Had I the right,--I should forgive you now . . ."
3023,VI. CINEMA,"We were two dupes . . . Come, let us walk in starlight,"
3024,VI. CINEMA,"And feed our griefs: we do not break, but bow."
3025,VI. CINEMA,
3026,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand, then, come with me"
3027,VI. CINEMA,By the white shadowy crashings of a sea . . .
3028,VI. CINEMA,Look how the long volutes of foam unfold
3029,VI. CINEMA,To spread their mottled shimmer along the sand! . . .
3030,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand,"
3031,VI. CINEMA,"Do not remember how these depths are cold,"
3032,VI. CINEMA,"Nor how, when you are dead,"
3033,VI. CINEMA,Green leagues of sea will glimmer above your head.
3034,VI. CINEMA,"You lean your face upon your hands and cry,"
3035,VI. CINEMA,"The blown sand whispers about your feet,"
3036,VI. CINEMA,"Terrible seems it now to die,--"
3037,VI. CINEMA,"Terrible now, with life so incomplete,"
3038,VI. CINEMA,"To turn away from the balconies and the music,"
3039,VI. CINEMA,"The sunlit afternoons,"
3040,VI. CINEMA,To hear behind you there a far-off laughter
3041,VI. CINEMA,Lost in a stirring of sand among dry dunes . . .
3042,VI. CINEMA,"Die not sadly, you whom life has beaten!"
3043,VI. CINEMA,"Lift your face up, laughing, die like a queen!"
3044,VI. CINEMA,Take cold flowers of foam in your warm white fingers!
3045,VI. CINEMA,Death's but a change of sky from blue to green . . .
3046,VI. CINEMA,
3047,VI. CINEMA,"As evening falls,"
3048,VI. CINEMA,"The walls grow luminous and warm, the walls"
3049,VI. CINEMA,"Tremble and glow . . . the music breathes upon us,"
3050,VI. CINEMA,"The rayed white shaft plays over our heads like magic,"
3051,VI. CINEMA,And to and fro we move and lean and change . . .
3052,VI. CINEMA,"You, in a world grown strange,"
3053,VI. CINEMA,"Laugh at a darkness, clench your hands despairing,"
3054,VI. CINEMA,"Smash your glass on a floor, no longer caring,"
3055,VI. CINEMA,Sink suddenly down and cry . . .
3056,VI. CINEMA,"You hear the applause that greets your latest rival,"
3057,VI. CINEMA,You are forgotten: your rival--who knows?--is I . . .
3058,VI. CINEMA,"I laugh in the warm bright light of answering laughter,"
3059,VI. CINEMA,I am inspired and young . . . and though I see
3060,VI. CINEMA,"You sitting alone there, dark, with shut eyes crying,"
3061,VI. CINEMA,"I bask in the light, and in your hate of me . . ."
3062,VI. CINEMA,"Failure . . . well, the time comes soon or later . . ."
3063,VI. CINEMA,"The night must come . . . and I'll be one who clings,"
3064,VI. CINEMA,"Desperately, to hold the applause, one instant,--"
3065,VI. CINEMA,To keep some youngster waiting in the wings.
3066,VI. CINEMA,
3067,VI. CINEMA,"The music changes tone . . . a room is darkened,"
3068,VI. CINEMA,"Someone is moving . . . the crack of white light widens,"
3069,VI. CINEMA,And all is dark again; till suddenly falls
3070,VI. CINEMA,"A wandering disk of light on floor and walls,"
3071,VI. CINEMA,"Winks out, returns again, climbs and descends,"
3072,VI. CINEMA,"Gleams on a clock, a glass, shrinks back to darkness;"
3073,VI. CINEMA,"And then at last, in the chaos of that place,"
3074,VI. CINEMA,Dazzles like frozen fire on your clear face.
3075,VI. CINEMA,"Well, I have found you.  We have met at last."
3076,VI. CINEMA,Now you shall not escape me: in your eyes
3077,VI. CINEMA,"I see the horrible huddlings of your past,--"
3078,VI. CINEMA,"All you remember blackens, utters cries,"
3079,VI. CINEMA,Reaches far hands and faint.  I hold the light
3080,VI. CINEMA,"Close to your cheek, watch the pained pupils shrink,--"
3081,VI. CINEMA,Watch the vile ghosts of all you vilely think . . .
3082,VI. CINEMA,Now all the hatreds of my life have met
3083,VI. CINEMA,"To hold high carnival . . . we do not speak,"
3084,VI. CINEMA,"My fingers find the well-loved throat they seek,"
3085,VI. CINEMA,"And press, and fling you down . . . and then forget."
3086,VI. CINEMA,
3087,VI. CINEMA,Who plays for me?  What sudden drums keep time
3088,VI. CINEMA,To the ecstatic rhythm of my crime?
3089,VI. CINEMA,What flute shrills out as moonlight strikes the floor? . .
3090,VI. CINEMA,What violin so faintly cries
3091,VI. CINEMA,Seeing how strangely in the moon he lies? . . .
3092,VI. CINEMA,"The room grows dark once more,"
3093,VI. CINEMA,"The crack of white light narrows around the door,"
3094,VI. CINEMA,"And all is silent, except a slow complaining"
3095,VI. CINEMA,"Of flutes and violins, like music waning."
3096,VI. CINEMA,
3097,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand, then, walk with me"
3098,VI. CINEMA,By the slow soundless crashings of a sea . . .
3099,VI. CINEMA,"Look, how white these shells are, on this sand!"
3100,VI. CINEMA,"Take my hand,"
3101,VI. CINEMA,And watch the waves run inward from the sky
3102,VI. CINEMA,Line upon foaming line to plunge and die.
3103,VI. CINEMA,"The music that bound our lives is lost behind us,"
3104,VI. CINEMA,Paltry it seems . . . here in this wind-swung place
3105,VI. CINEMA,Motionless under the sky's vast vault of azure
3106,VI. CINEMA,"We stand in a terror of beauty, face to face."
3107,VI. CINEMA,"The dry grass creaks in the wind, the blown sand whispers,"
3108,VI. CINEMA,
3109,VI. CINEMA,"The soft sand seethes on the dunes, the clear grains glisten,"
3110,VI. CINEMA,Once they were rock . . . a chaos of golden boulders . . .
3111,VI. CINEMA,Now they are blown by the wind . . . we stand and listen
3112,VI. CINEMA,To the sliding of grain upon timeless grain
3113,VI. CINEMA,And feel our lives go past like a whisper of pain.
3114,VI. CINEMA,"Have I not seen you, have we not met before"
3115,VI. CINEMA,Here on this sun-and-sea-wrecked shore?
3116,VI. CINEMA,You shade your sea-gray eyes with a sunlit hand
3117,VI. CINEMA,"And peer at me . . . far sea-gulls, in your eyes,"
3118,VI. CINEMA,"Flash in the sun, go down . . . I hear slow sand,"
3119,VI. CINEMA,And shrink to nothing beneath blue brilliant skies . . .

3123,VI. CINEMA,The music ends.  The screen grows dark.  We hurry
3124,VI. CINEMA,"To go our devious secret ways, forgetting"
3125,VI. CINEMA,"Those many lives . . .  We loved, we laughed, we killed,"
3126,VI. CINEMA,"We danced in fire, we drowned in a whirl of sea-waves."
3127,VI. CINEMA,"The flutes are stilled, and a thousand dreams are stilled."
3128,VI. CINEMA,
3129,VI. CINEMA,"Whose body have I found beside dark waters,"
3130,VI. CINEMA,"The cold white body, garlanded with sea-weed?"
3131,VI. CINEMA,Staring with wide eyes at the sky?
3132,VI. CINEMA,"I bent my head above it, and cried in silence."
3133,VI. CINEMA,Only the things I dreamed of heard my cry.
3134,VI. CINEMA,
3135,VI. CINEMA,"Once I loved, and she I loved was darkened."
3136,VI. CINEMA,"Again I loved, and love itself was darkened."
3137,VI. CINEMA,Vainly we follow the circle of shadowy days.
3138,VI. CINEMA,"The screen at last grows dark, the flutes are silent."
3139,VI. CINEMA,The doors of night are closed.  We go our ways.

3144,VII.,The sun goes down in a cold pale flare of light.
3145,VII.,The trees grow dark: the shadows lean to the east:
3146,VII.,"And lights wink out through the windows, one by one."
3147,VII.,A clamor of frosty sirens mourns at the night.
3148,VII.,Pale slate-grey clouds whirl up from the sunken sun.
3149,VII.,
3150,VII.,"And the wandering one, the inquisitive dreamer of dreams,"
3151,VII.,"The eternal asker of answers, stands in the street,"
3152,VII.,And lifts his palms for the first cold ghost of rain.
3153,VII.,The purple lights leap down the hill before him.
3154,VII.,The gorgeous night has begun again.
3155,VII.,
3156,VII.,"'I will ask them all, I will ask them all their dreams,"
3157,VII.,"I will hold my light above them and seek their faces,"
3158,VII.,"I will hear them whisper, invisible in their veins. . . . '"
3159,VII.,"The eternal asker of answers becomes as the darkness,"
3160,VII.,"Or as a wind blown over a myriad forest,"
3161,VII.,Or as the numberless voices of long-drawn rains.
3162,VII.,
3163,VII.,"We hear him and take him among us like a wind of music,"
3164,VII.,Like the ghost of a music we have somewhere heard;
3165,VII.,"We crowd through the streets in a dazzle of pallid lamplight,"
3166,VII.,"We pour in a sinister mass, we ascend a stair,"
3167,VII.,"With laughter and cry, with word upon murmured word,"
3168,VII.,"We flow, we descend, we turn. . . . and the eternal dreamer"
3169,VII.,"Moves on among us like light, like evening air . . ."
3170,VII.,
3171,VII.,"Good night! good night! good night! we go our ways,"
3172,VII.,"The rain runs over the pavement before our feet,"
3173,VII.,"The cold rain falls, the rain sings."
3174,VII.,"We walk, we run, we ride.  We turn our faces"
3175,VII.,To what the eternal evening brings.
3176,VII.,
3177,VII.,"Our hands are hot and raw with the stones we have laid,"
3178,VII.,We have built a tower of stone high into the sky.
3179,VII.,We have built a city of towers.
3180,VII.,"Our hands are light, they are singing with emptiness."
3181,VII.,Our souls are light.  They have shaken a burden of hours. . . .
3182,VII.,What did we build it for?  Was it all a dream? . . .
3183,VII.,Ghostly above us in lamplight the towers gleam . . .
3184,VII.,And after a while they will fall to dust and rain;
3185,VII.,Or else we will tear them down with impatient hands;
3186,VII.,"And hew rock out of the earth, and build them again."
