179,SILENCE,
180,SILENCE,"I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea,"
181,SILENCE,"And the silence of the city when it pauses,"
182,SILENCE,"And the silence of a man and a maid,"
183,SILENCE,"And the silence for which music alone finds the word,"
184,SILENCE,"And the silence of the woods before the winds of spring begin,"
185,SILENCE,And the silence of the sick
186,SILENCE,When their eyes roam about the room.
187,SILENCE,And I ask: For the depths
188,SILENCE,Of what use is language?
189,SILENCE,A beast of the field moans a few times
190,SILENCE,When death takes its young:
191,SILENCE,And we are voiceless in the presence of realities--
192,SILENCE,We cannot speak.
193,SILENCE,
194,SILENCE,A curious boy asks an old soldier
195,SILENCE,"Sitting in front of the grocery store,"
196,SILENCE,"""How did you lose your leg?"""
197,SILENCE,"And the old soldier is struck with silence,"
198,SILENCE,"Or his mind flies away,"
199,SILENCE,Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg.
200,SILENCE,It comes back jocosely
201,SILENCE,"And he says, ""A bear bit it off."""
202,SILENCE,"And the boy wonders, while the old soldier"
203,SILENCE,"Dumbly, feebly lives over"
204,SILENCE,"The flashes of guns, the thunder of cannon,"
205,SILENCE,"The shrieks of the slain,"
206,SILENCE,"And himself lying on the ground,"
207,SILENCE,"And the hospital surgeons, the knives,"
208,SILENCE,And the long days in bed.
209,SILENCE,But if he could describe it all
210,SILENCE,He would be an artist.
211,SILENCE,But if he were an artist there would be deeper wounds
212,SILENCE,Which he could not describe.
213,SILENCE,
214,SILENCE,"There is the silence of a great hatred,"
215,SILENCE,"And the silence of a great love,"
216,SILENCE,"And the silence of a deep peace of mind,"
217,SILENCE,And the silence of an embittered friendship.
218,SILENCE,"There is the silence of a spiritual crisis,"
219,SILENCE,"Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured,"
220,SILENCE,Comes with visions not to be uttered
221,SILENCE,Into a realm of higher life.
222,SILENCE,And the silence of the gods who understand each other without speech.
223,SILENCE,There is the silence of defeat.
224,SILENCE,There is the silence of those unjustly punished;
225,SILENCE,And the silence of the dying whose hand
226,SILENCE,Suddenly grips yours.
227,SILENCE,"There is the silence between father and son,"
228,SILENCE,"When the father cannot explain his life,"
229,SILENCE,Even though he be misunderstood for it.
230,SILENCE,
231,SILENCE,There is the silence that comes between husband and wife.
232,SILENCE,There is the silence of those who have failed;
233,SILENCE,And the vast silence that covers
234,SILENCE,Broken nations and vanquished leaders.
235,SILENCE,"There is the silence of Lincoln,"
236,SILENCE,Thinking of the poverty of his youth.
237,SILENCE,And the silence of Napoleon
238,SILENCE,After Waterloo.
239,SILENCE,And the silence of Jeanne d'Arc
240,SILENCE,"Saying amid the flames, ""Blessed Jesus""--"
241,SILENCE,"Revealing in two words all sorrow, all hope."
242,SILENCE,"And there is the silence of age,"
243,SILENCE,Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it
244,SILENCE,In words intelligible to those who have not lived
245,SILENCE,The great range of life.
246,SILENCE,
247,SILENCE,And there is the silence of the dead.
248,SILENCE,If we who are in life cannot speak
249,SILENCE,"Of profound experiences,"
250,SILENCE,Why do you marvel that the dead
251,SILENCE,Do not tell you of death?
252,SILENCE,Their silence shall be interpreted
253,SILENCE,As we approach them.

259,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
260,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
261,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Antonio loved the Lady Clare.
262,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,He caught her to him on the stair
263,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"And pressed her breasts and kissed her hair,"
264,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"And drew her lips in his, and drew"
265,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her soul out like a torch's flare.
266,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Her breath came quick, her blood swirled round;"
267,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her senses in a vortex swound.
268,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She tore him loose and turned around,"
269,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And reached her chamber in a bound
270,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her cheeks turned to a poppy's hue.
271,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
272,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She closed the door and turned the lock,"
273,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her breasts and flesh were turned to rock.
274,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She reeled as drunken from the shock.
275,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Before her eyes the devils skipped,"
276,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She thought she heard the devils mock.
277,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,For had her soul not been as pure
278,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"As sifted snow, could she endure"
279,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Antonio's passion and be sure
280,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Against his passion's strength and lure?
281,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Lean fears along her wonder slipped.
282,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
283,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Outside she heard a drunkard call,"
284,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She heard a beggar against the wall
285,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Shaking his cup, a harlot's squall"
286,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Struck through the riot like a sword,"
287,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And gashed the midnight's festival.
288,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She watched the city through the pane,"
289,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The old Silenus half insane,"
290,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,The idiot crowd that drags its chain--
291,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"And then she heard the bells again,"
292,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And heard the voices with the word:
293,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
294,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Ecco il santo! Up the street
295,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,There was the sound of running feet
296,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"From closing door and window seat,"
297,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And all the crowd turned on its way
298,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,The Saint of Poverty to greet.
299,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"He passed. And then a circling thrill,"
300,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"As water troubled which was still,"
301,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Went through her body like a chill,"
302,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Who of Antonio thought until
303,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She heard the Saint begin to pray.
304,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
305,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And then she turned into the room
306,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Her soul was cloven through with doom,"
307,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Treading the softness and the gloom
308,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Of Asia's silk and Persia's wool,"
309,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And China's magical perfume.
310,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She sickened from the vases hued
311,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"In corals, yellows, greens, the lewd"
312,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Twined dragon shapes and figures nude,"
313,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And tapestries that showed a brood
314,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Of leopards by a pool!
315,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
316,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Candles of wax she lit before
317,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,A pier glass standing from the floor;
318,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Up to the ceiling, off she tore"
319,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"With eager hands her jewels, then"
320,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,The silken vesture which she wore.
321,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her little breasts so round to see
322,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Were budded like the peony.
323,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Her arms were white as ivory,"
324,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And all her sunny hair lay free
325,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,As marigold or celandine.
326,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
327,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her blue eyes sparkled like a vase
328,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Of crackled turquoise, in her face"
329,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Was memory of the mad embrace
330,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Antonio gave her on the stair,"
331,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And on her cheeks a salt tear's trace.
332,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Like pigeon blood her lips were red.
333,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She clasped her bands above her head.
334,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Under her arms the waxlight shed
335,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Delicate halos where was spread
336,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,The downy growth of hair.
337,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
338,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Such sudden sin the virgin knew
339,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She quenched the tapers as she blew
340,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Puff! puff! upon them, then she threw"
341,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Herself in tears upon her knees,"
342,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And round her couch the curtain drew.
343,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She called upon St. Francis' name,"
344,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Feeling Antonio's passion maim
345,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her body with his passion's flame
346,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"To save her, save her from the shame"
347,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Of fancies such as these!
348,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
349,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"""Go by mad life and old pursuits,"
350,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The wine cup and the golden fruits,"
351,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The gilded mirrors, rosewood flutes,"
352,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,I would praise God forevermore
353,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"With harps of gold and silver lutes."""
354,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She stripped the velvet from her couch
355,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her broken spirit to avouch.
356,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She saw the devils slink and slouch,"
357,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And passion like a leopard crouch
358,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Half mirrored on the polished floor.
359,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
360,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Next day she found the saint and said:
361,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"I would be God's bride, I would wed"
362,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Poverty and I would eat the bread
363,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"That you for anchorites prepare,"
364,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,For my soul's sake I am in dread.
365,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Go then, said Francis, nothing loth,"
366,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Put off this gown of green snake cloth,"
367,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Put on one somber as a moth,"
368,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Then come to me and make your troth
369,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And I will clip your golden hair.
370,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
371,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"She went and came. But still there lay,"
372,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"A gem she did not put away,"
373,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"A locket twixt her breasts, all gay"
374,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"In shimmering pearls and tints of blue,"
375,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And inlay work of fruit and spray.
376,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,St. Francis felt it as he slipped
377,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,His hand across her breast and whipped
378,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her golden tresses ere he clipped--
379,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,He closed his eyes then as he gripped
380,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The shears, plunged the shears through."
381,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
382,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,The waterfall of living gold.
383,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The locks fell to the floor and rolled,"
384,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And curled like serpents which unfold.
385,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And there sat Lady Clare despoiled.
386,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Of worldly glory manifold.
387,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,She thrilled to feel him take and hide
388,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"The locket from her breast, a tide"
389,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Of passion caught them side by side.
390,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"He was the bridegroom, she the bride--"
391,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Their flesh but not their spirits foiled.
392,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
393,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Thus was the Lady Clare debased
394,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,To sack cloth and around her waist
395,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,A rope the jeweled belt replaced.
396,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Her feet made free of silken hose
397,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Naked in wooden sandals cased
398,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Went bruised to Bastia's chapel, then"
399,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,They housed her in St. Damian
400,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And here she prayed for poor women
401,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And here St. Francis sought her when
402,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,His faith sank under earthly woes.
403,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
404,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Antonio cursed St. Clare in rhyme
405,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And took to wine and got the lime
406,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Of hatred on his soul, in time"
407,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Grew healed though left a little lame,"
408,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,And laughed about it in his prime;
409,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,When he could see with crystal eyes
410,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,That love is a winged thing which flies;
411,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,"Some break the wings, some let them rise"
412,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,From earth like God's dove to the skies
413,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,Diffused in heavenly flame.
414,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,
415,ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE,

418,THE COCKED HAT,THE COCKED HAT
419,THE COCKED HAT,
420,THE COCKED HAT,Would that someone would knock Mr. Bryan into a cocked hat.--WOODROW
421,WILSON.,WILSON.
422,WILSON.,
423,WILSON.,
424,WILSON.,"It ain't really a hat at all, Ed:"
425,WILSON.,"You know that, don't you?"
426,WILSON.,"When you bowl over six out of the nine pins,"
427,WILSON.,And the three that are standing
428,WILSON.,"Are the triangular three in front,"
429,WILSON.,You've knocked the nine into a cocked hat.
430,WILSON.,"If it was really a hat, he would be knocked in, too."
431,WILSON.,"Which he hardly is. For a man with money,"
432,WILSON.,And a man who can draw a crowd to listen
433,WILSON.,"To what he says, ain't all-in yet...."
434,WILSON.,"Oh yes, defeated"
435,WILSON.,"And killed off a dozen times, but still"
436,WILSON.,He's one of the three nine pins that's standing ...
437,WILSON.,"Eh? Why, the other is Teddy, the other"
438,WILSON.,"Wilson, we'll say. We'll see, perhaps."
439,WILSON.,But six are down to make the cocked hat--
440,WILSON.,"That's me and thousands of others like me,"
441,WILSON.,And the first-rate men who were cuffed about
442,WILSON.,"After the Civil War,"
443,WILSON.,And most of the more than six million men
444,WILSON.,"Who followed this fellow into the ditch,"
445,WILSON.,While he walked down the ditch and stepped to the level--
446,WILSON.,Following an ideal!
447,WILSON.,
448,WILSON.,*       *       *       *       *
449,WILSON.,
450,WILSON.,"Do you remember how slim he was,"
451,WILSON.,"And trim he was,"
452,WILSON.,"With black hair and pale brow,"
453,WILSON.,"And the hawk-like nose and flashing eyes,"
454,WILSON.,Not turning slowly like an owl
455,WILSON.,But with a sudden eagle motion?...
456,WILSON.,
457,WILSON.,"One time, in '96, he came here"
458,WILSON.,And we had just a dollar and sixty cents
459,WILSON.,In the treasury of the organization.
460,WILSON.,So I stuck his lithograph on a pole
461,WILSON.,And started out for the station.
462,WILSON.,By the time we got back here to Clark street
463,WILSON.,"Four thousand men were marching in line,"
464,WILSON.,And a band that was playing for an opening
465,WILSON.,Of a restaurant on Franklin street
466,WILSON.,Had left the job and was following his carriage.
467,WILSON.,"Why, it took all the money Mark Hanna could raise"
468,WILSON.,"To beat me, with nothing but a pole"
469,WILSON.,And a lithograph.
470,WILSON.,And it wasn't because he was one of the prophets
471,WILSON.,Come back to earth again.
472,WILSON.,It shows how human hearts are hungry
473,WILSON.,How wonderfully true they are--
474,WILSON.,And how they will rise and follow a man
475,WILSON.,Who seems to see the truth!
476,WILSON.,"Well, these fellows who marched are the cocked hat,"
477,WILSON.,"And I am the cocked hat and the six millions,"
478,WILSON.,"And more are the cocked hat,"
479,WILSON.,Who got themselves despised or suspected
480,WILSON.,Of ignorance or something for being with him.
481,WILSON.,"But still, he's one of the pins that's standing."
482,WILSON.,"He got the money that he went after,"
483,WILSON.,"And he has a place in history, perhaps--"
484,WILSON.,Because we took the blow and fell down
485,WILSON.,When the ripping ball went wild on the alley.
486,WILSON.,
487,WILSON.,*       *       *       *       *
488,WILSON.,
489,WILSON.,"For we were radicals,"
490,WILSON.,And he wasn't a radical.
491,WILSON.,"Eh? Why, a radical stands for freedom,"
492,WILSON.,And for truth--which he never finds
493,WILSON.,But always looks for.
494,WILSON.,A radical is not a moralist.
495,WILSON.,A radical doesn't say:
496,WILSON.,"""This is true and you must believe it;"
497,WILSON.,"This is good and you must accept it,"
498,WILSON.,And if you don't believe it and accept it
499,WILSON.,"We'll get a law and make you,"
500,WILSON.,"And if you don't obey the law, we'll kill you--"""
501,WILSON.,Oh no! A radical stands for freedom.
502,WILSON.,
503,WILSON.,*       *       *       *       *
504,WILSON.,
505,WILSON.,Do you remember that banquet at the Tremont
506,WILSON.,In '97 on Jackson's day?
507,WILSON.,Bryan and Altgeld walked together
508,WILSON.,Out to the banquet room.
509,WILSON.,That's the time he said the bolters must
510,WILSON.,"Bring fruits meet for repentance--ha! ha! Oh, Gawd!--"
511,WILSON.,"They never did it and they didn't have to,"
512,WILSON.,"For they had made friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,"
513,WILSON.,"Even as he did, a little later, in his own way."
514,WILSON.,"Well, Darrow was there that night."
515,WILSON.,"I thought it was terribly raw in him,"
516,WILSON.,"But he said to Bryan, there, in a group:"
517,WILSON.,"""You'd better go back to Lincoln and study"
518,WILSON.,"Science, history, philosophy,"
519,WILSON.,"And read Flaubert's Madam something-or-other,"
520,WILSON.,And quit this village religious stuff.
521,WILSON.,You're head of the party before you are ready
522,WILSON.,"And a leader should lead with thought."""
523,WILSON.,And Bryan turned to the others and said:
524,WILSON.,"""Darrow's the only man in the world"
525,WILSON.,"Who looks down on me for believing in God."""
526,WILSON.,"""Your kind of a God,"" snapped Darrow."
527,WILSON.,"Honest, Ed, I didn't see this religious business"
528,WILSON.,In Bryan in '96 or 1900.
529,WILSON.,"Oh well, I knew he went to Church,"
530,WILSON.,And talked as statesmen do of God--
531,WILSON.,"But McKinley did it, and I used to laugh:"
532,WILSON.,"""We've got a man to match McKinley,"
533,WILSON.,"And it's good for us, in a squeeze like this,"
534,WILSON.,We didn't nominate some fellow
535,WILSON.,"Ethical culture or Unitarian."""
536,WILSON.,"You see, the newspapers and preachers then"
537,WILSON.,Were raising such a hullabaloo
538,WILSON.,"About irreligion and dishonesty,"
539,WILSON.,"And calling old Altgeld an anarchist,"
540,WILSON.,And comparing us to Robespierre
541,WILSON.,And the guillotine boys in France.
542,WILSON.,And a little of this religion came in handy.
543,WILSON.,"The same as if you saw a Mason button on me,"
544,WILSON.,"You'd know, you see--but Gee!"
545,WILSON.,"He was 24-carat religious,"
546,WILSON.,A cover-to-cover man....
547,WILSON.,"He was a trained collie,"
548,WILSON.,"And he looked like a lion,"
549,WILSON.,There in the convention of '96--What do you know about that?
550,WILSON.,
551,WILSON.,*       *       *       *       *
552,WILSON.,
553,WILSON.,"But right here, I tell you he ain't a hypocrite,"
554,WILSON.,This ain't a pose. But I'll tell you:
555,WILSON.,"In '96 when they knocked him out,"
556,WILSON.,I know what he said to himself as well
557,WILSON.,As if I heard him say it ...
558,WILSON.,I'll tell you in a minute.
559,WILSON.,"But suppose you were giving a lecture on the constitution,"
560,WILSON.,"And you got mixed on your dates,"
561,WILSON.,"And the audience rotten-egged you,"
562,WILSON.,And some one in the confusion
563,WILSON.,"Stole the door receipts,"
564,WILSON.,"And there you were, disgraced and broke!"
565,WILSON.,"But suppose you could just change your clothes,"
566,WILSON.,And lecture to the same audience
567,WILSON.,"On the religious nature of Washington,"
568,WILSON.,And be applauded and make money--
569,WILSON.,"You'd do it, wouldn't you?"
570,WILSON.,"Well, this is what Bill said to himself:"
571,WILSON.,"""I'm naturally regular and religious."
572,WILSON.,I'm a moral man and I can prove it
573,WILSON.,"By any one in Marion County,"
574,WILSON.,"Or Jacksonville or Lincoln, Nebraska."
575,WILSON.,"I'm a radical, but a radical"
576,WILSON.,Alone can be religious.
577,WILSON.,"I belong to the church, if not to the bank,"
578,WILSON.,Of the people who defeated me.
579,WILSON.,And I'll prove to religious people
580,WILSON.,That I'm a man to be trusted--
581,WILSON.,And just what a radical is.
582,WILSON.,And I'll make some money while winning the votes
583,WILSON.,"Of the churches over the country.""..."
584,WILSON.,
585,WILSON.,"That's it--it ain't hypocrisy,"
586,WILSON.,"It's using what you are for ends,"
587,WILSON.,When you find yourself in trouble.
588,WILSON.,"And this accounts for ""The Prince of Peace""--"
589,WILSON.,Except no one but him could write it--
590,WILSON.,"And ""The Value of an Ideal""--"
591,WILSON.,(Which is money in bank and several farms) ...
592,WILSON.,
593,WILSON.,His place in history?
594,WILSON.,"One time my grandfather, who was nearly blind,"
595,WILSON.,Went out to sow some grass seed.
596,WILSON.,"They had two sacks in the barn,"
597,WILSON.,"One with grass seed, one with fertilizer,"
598,WILSON.,"And he got the sack with fertilizer,"
599,WILSON.,"And scattered it over the ground,"
600,WILSON.,Thinking he was sowing grass.
601,WILSON.,"And as he was finishing up, a grandchild,"
602,WILSON.,"Dorothy, eight years old,"
603,WILSON.,"Followed him, dropping flower seeds."
604,WILSON.,"Well, after a time"
605,WILSON.,That was the greatest patch of weeds
606,WILSON.,"You ever saw! And the old man sat,"
607,WILSON.,"Half blind, on the porch, and said:"
608,WILSON.,"""Good land, that grass is growing!"""
609,WILSON.,And there was nothing but weeds except
610,WILSON.,A few nasturtiums here and there
611,WILSON.,That Dorothy had sown....
612,WILSON.,"Well, I forgot."
613,WILSON.,There was a sunflower in one corner
614,WILSON.,That looked like a man with a golden beard
615,WILSON.,"And a mass of tangled, curly hair--"
616,WILSON.,And a pumpkin growing near it....
617,WILSON.,
618,WILSON.,*       *       *       *       *
619,WILSON.,
620,WILSON.,"Say, Ed! lend me eighty dollars"
621,WILSON.,To pay my life insurance.

626,THE VISION,THE VISION
627,THE VISION,
628,THE VISION,
629,THE VISION,Of that dear vale where you and I have lain
630,THE VISION,Scanning the mysteries of life and death
631,THE VISION,"I dreamed, though how impassable the space"
632,THE VISION,Of time between the present and the past!
633,THE VISION,This was the vision that possessed my mind;
634,THE VISION,I thought the weird and gusty days of March
635,THE VISION,Had eased themselves in melody and peace.
636,THE VISION,"Pale lights, swift shadows, lucent stalks, clear streams,"
637,THE VISION,"Cool, rosy eves behind the penciled mesh"
638,THE VISION,"Of hazel thickets, and the huge feathered boughs"
639,THE VISION,Of walnut trees stretched singing to the blast;
640,THE VISION,And the first pleasantries of sheep and kine;
641,THE VISION,The cautioned twitterings of hidden birds;
642,THE VISION,The flight of geese among the scattered clouds;
643,THE VISION,Night's weeping stars and all the pageantries
644,THE VISION,"Of awakened life had blossomed into May,"
645,THE VISION,Whilst she with trailing violets in her hair
646,THE VISION,"Blew music from the stops of watery stems,"
647,THE VISION,"And swept the grasses with her viewless robes,"
648,THE VISION,"Which dreaming men thought voices, dreaming still."
649,THE VISION,Now as I lay in vision by the stream
650,THE VISION,"That flows amidst our well beloved vale,"
651,THE VISION,I looked throughout the vista stretched between
652,THE VISION,Two ranging hills; one meadowed rich in grass;
653,THE VISION,"The other wooded, thick and quite obscure"
654,THE VISION,"With overgrowth, rank in the luxury"
655,THE VISION,"Of all wild places, but ever growing sparse"
656,THE VISION,Of trees or saplings on the sudden slope
657,THE VISION,That met the grassy level of the vale;--
658,THE VISION,"But still within the shadow of those woods,"
659,THE VISION,"Which sprinkled all beneath with fragrant dew,"
660,THE VISION,"There grew all flowers, which tempted little paths"
661,THE VISION,"Between them, up and on into the wood."
662,THE VISION,"Here, as the sun had left his midday peak"
663,THE VISION,The incommunicable blue of heaven blent
664,THE VISION,"With his fierce splendor, filling all the air"
665,THE VISION,"With softened glory, while the pasturage"
666,THE VISION,Trembled with color of the poppy blooms
667,THE VISION,Shook by the steps of the swift-sandaled wind.
668,THE VISION,Nor any sound beside disturbed the dream
669,THE VISION,Of Silence slumbering on the drowsy flowers.
670,THE VISION,Then as I looked upon the widest space
671,THE VISION,Of open meadow where the sunlight fell
672,THE VISION,"In veils of tempered radiance, I saw"
673,THE VISION,The form of one who had escaped the care
674,THE VISION,And equal dullness of our common day.
675,THE VISION,For like a bright mist rising from the earth
676,THE VISION,"He made appearance, growing more distinct"
677,THE VISION,"Until I saw the stole, likewise the lyre"
678,THE VISION,Grasped by the fingers of the modeled hand.
679,THE VISION,"Yea, I did see the glory of his hair"
680,THE VISION,Against the deep green bay-leaves filleting
681,THE VISION,The ungathered locks. And so throughout the vale
682,THE VISION,His figure stood distinct and his own shade
683,THE VISION,Was the sole shadow. Deeming this approach
684,THE VISION,"Augur of good, as if in hidden ways"
685,THE VISION,Of loveliness the gods do still appear
686,THE VISION,"The counselors of men, and even where"
687,THE VISION,"Wonder and meditation wooed us oft,"
688,THE VISION,"I cried, ""Apollo""--and his form dissolved,"
689,THE VISION,"As if the nymphs of echo, who took up"
690,THE VISION,"The voice and bore it to the hollow wood,"
691,THE VISION,By that same flight had startled the great god
692,THE VISION,To vanishment. And thereupon I woke
693,THE VISION,And disarrayed the figment of my thought.
694,THE VISION,"For of the very air, magic with hues,"
695,THE VISION,"Blent with the distant objects, I had formed"
696,THE VISION,"The splendid apparition, and so knew"
697,THE VISION,"It was, alas! a dream within a dream!"

1096,THE LOOP,A legless man fastened upon a board
1097,THE LOOP,With casters 'neath it by a sudden shove
1098,THE LOOP,Darts out of danger. And upon the corner
1099,THE LOOP,"A lassie tells a man that God is love,"
1100,THE LOOP,Holding a tambourine with its copper hoard
1101,THE LOOP,To be augmented by the drunken scorner.
1102,THE LOOP,A woman with no eyeballs in her sockets
1103,THE LOOP,"Plays ""Rock of Ages"" on a wheezy organ."
1104,THE LOOP,A newsboy with cold hands thrust in his pockets
1105,THE LOOP,"Cries, ""All about the will of Pierpont Morgan!"""
1106,THE LOOP,The roofline of the street now sinks and dwindles.
1107,THE LOOP,The windows are begrimed with dust and beer.
1108,THE LOOP,"A child half clothed, with legs as thin as spindles,"
1109,THE LOOP,Carries a basket with some bits of coal.
1110,THE LOOP,"Between lace curtains eyes of yellow leer,"
1111,THE LOOP,The cheeks splotched with white places like the skin
1112,THE LOOP,Inside an eggshell--destitute of soul.
1113,THE LOOP,One sees a brass lamp oozing kerosene
1114,THE LOOP,Upon a stand whereon her elbows lean;
1115,THE LOOP,"Lighted, it soon will welcome negroes in."
1116,THE LOOP,
1117,THE LOOP,The railroad tracks are near. We almost choke
1118,THE LOOP,From filth whirled from the street and stinging vapors.
1119,THE LOOP,Great engines vomit gas and heavy smoke
1120,THE LOOP,"Upon a north wind driving tattered papers,"
1121,THE LOOP,Dry dung and dust and refuse down the street.
1122,THE LOOP,A circumambient roar as of a wheel
1123,THE LOOP,Whirring far off--a monster's heart whose beat
1124,THE LOOP,"Is full of murmurs, comes as we retreat"
1125,THE LOOP,Towards Twenty-second. And a man with jaw
1126,THE LOOP,"Set like a tiger's, with a dirty beard,"
1127,THE LOOP,"Skulks toward the loop, with heavy wrists red-raw"
1128,THE LOOP,Glowing above his pockets where his hands
1129,THE LOOP,"Pushed tensely round his hips the coat tails draw,"
1130,THE LOOP,And show what seems a slender piece of metal
1131,THE LOOP,In his hip pocket. On these barren strands
1132,THE LOOP,He waits for midnight for old scores to settle
1133,THE LOOP,"Against his ancient foe society,"
1134,THE LOOP,Who keeps the soup house and who builds the jails.
1135,THE LOOP,Switchmen and firemen with their dinner pails
1136,THE LOOP,"Go by him homeward, and he wonders if"
1137,THE LOOP,These fellows know a hundred thousand workers
1138,THE LOOP,"Walk up and down the city's highways, stiff"
1139,THE LOOP,"From cold and hunger, doomed to poverty,"
1140,THE LOOP,As wretched as the thieves and crooks and shirkers.
1141,THE LOOP,"He scurries to the lake front, loiters past"
1142,THE LOOP,"The windows of wax lights with scarlet shades,"
1143,THE LOOP,Where smiling diners back of ambuscades
1144,THE LOOP,Of silk and velvet hear not winter's blast
1145,THE LOOP,Blowing across the lake. He has a thought
1146,THE LOOP,"Of Michigan, where once at picking berries"
1147,THE LOOP,He spent a summer--then his eye is caught
1148,THE LOOP,"At Randolph street by written light which tarries,"
1149,THE LOOP,Then like a film runs into sentences.
1150,THE LOOP,He sees it all as from a black abyss.
1151,THE LOOP,"Taxis with skid chains rattle, limousines"
1152,THE LOOP,Draw up to awnings; for a space he catches
1153,THE LOOP,"A scent of musk or violets, sees the patches"
1154,THE LOOP,On powdered cheeks of furred and jeweled queens.
1155,THE LOOP,"The color round his cruel mouth grows whiter,"
1156,THE LOOP,He thrusts his coarse hands in his pockets tighter:
1157,THE LOOP,"He is a thief, he knows he is a thief,"
1158,THE LOOP,"He is a thief found out, and, as he knows,"
1159,THE LOOP,The whole loop is a kingdom held in fief
1160,THE LOOP,By men who work with laws instead of blows
1161,THE LOOP,"From sling shots, so he curses under breath"
1162,THE LOOP,The money and the invisible hand that owns
1163,THE LOOP,"From year to year, in spite of change and death,"
1164,THE LOOP,"The wires for the lights and telephones,"
1165,THE LOOP,"The railways on the streets, and overhead"
1166,THE LOOP,"The railways, and beneath the winding tunnel"
1167,THE LOOP,Which crooks stole from the city for a runnel
1168,THE LOOP,To drain her nickels; and the pipes of lead
1169,THE LOOP,"Which carry gas, wrapped round us like a snake,"
1170,THE LOOP,"And round the courts, whose grip no court can break."
1171,THE LOOP,"He curses bitterly all those who rise,"
1172,THE LOOP,And rule by just the spirit which he plies
1173,THE LOOP,Coarsely against the world's great store of wealth;
1174,THE LOOP,Bankers and usurers and cliques whose stealth
1175,THE LOOP,"Works witchcraft through the market and the press,"
1176,THE LOOP,"And hires editors, or owns the stock"
1177,THE LOOP,"Controlling papers, playing with finesse"
1178,THE LOOP,"The city's thinking, that they may unlock"
1179,THE LOOP,Treasures and powers like burglars in the dark.
1180,THE LOOP,"And thinking thus and cursing, through a flurry"
1181,THE LOOP,Of sudden snow he hastens on to Clark.
1182,THE LOOP,In a cheap room there is an eye to mark
1183,THE LOOP,His coming and be glad. His footsteps hurry.
1184,THE LOOP,"She will have money, earned this afternoon"
1185,THE LOOP,Through men who took her from a near saloon
1186,THE LOOP,Wherein she sits at table to dragoon
1187,THE LOOP,Roughnecks or simpletons upon a lark.
1188,THE LOOP,Within a little hall a fierce-eyed youth
1189,THE LOOP,Rants of the burdens on the people's backs--
1190,THE LOOP,He would cure all things with the single tax.
1191,THE LOOP,"A clergyman demands more gospel truth,"
1192,THE LOOP,Speaking to Christians at a weekly dinner.
1193,THE LOOP,"A parlor Marxian, for a beginner"
1194,THE LOOP,Would take the railways. And amid applause
1195,THE LOOP,"Where lawyers dine, a judge says all will be"
1196,THE LOOP,Well if we hand down to posterity
1197,THE LOOP,Respect for courts and judges and the laws.
1198,THE LOOP,"An anarchist would fight. Upon the whole,"
1199,THE LOOP,"Another thinks, to cultivate one's soul"
1200,THE LOOP,Is most important--let the passing show
1201,THE LOOP,"Go where it wills, and where it wills to go."
1202,THE LOOP,

1204,THE LOOP,To be so quiet and indifferent.

1241,IN THE CAR,"As we thought for a little while,"
1242,IN THE CAR,"Alone in the car, in the corner"
1243,IN THE CAR,Around the turn of the aisle.
1244,IN THE CAR,
1245,IN THE CAR,"A quiver came in your voice,"
1246,IN THE CAR,Your eyes were sorrowful too;
1247,IN THE CAR,"'Twas over--I strode to the doorway,"
1248,IN THE CAR,Then turned to wave an adieu.
1249,IN THE CAR,
1250,IN THE CAR,"But you had not come from the corner,"
1251,IN THE CAR,"And though I had gone so far,"
1252,IN THE CAR,"I retraced, and faced you coming"
1253,IN THE CAR,Into the aisle of the car.
1254,IN THE CAR,
1255,IN THE CAR,You stopped as one who was caught
1256,IN THE CAR,In an evil mood by surprise.--
1257,IN THE CAR,"I want to forget, I am trying"
1258,IN THE CAR,To forget the look in your eyes.
1259,IN THE CAR,
1260,IN THE CAR,"Your face was blank and cold,"
1261,IN THE CAR,Like Lot's wife turned to salt.
1262,IN THE CAR,I suddenly trapped and discovered
1263,IN THE CAR,Your soul in a hidden fault.
1264,IN THE CAR,
1265,IN THE CAR,"Your eyes were tearless and wide,"
1266,IN THE CAR,And your wide eyes looked on me
1267,IN THE CAR,"Like a Mænad musing murder,"
1268,IN THE CAR,Or the mask of Melpomene.
1269,IN THE CAR,
1270,IN THE CAR,And there in a flash of lightning

1272,IN THE CAR,"That your heart contained no sorrow,"
1273,IN THE CAR,And your heart contained no love.
1274,IN THE CAR,
1275,IN THE CAR,"And my heart is light and heavy,"

1289,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Word on the leaf--
1290,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"How did you, Peter, when ne'er on His breast"
1291,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,You leaned and were blest--
1292,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,And none except Judas and you broke the faith
1293,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"To the day of His death,--"
1294,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You, Peter, the fisherman, worthy of blame,"
1295,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Arise to this fame?
1296,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,
1297,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,'Twas you in the garden who fell into sleep
1298,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"And the watch failed to keep,"
1299,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,When Jesus was praying and pressed with the weight
1300,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Of the oncoming fate.
1301,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,'Twas you in the court of the palace who warmed
1302,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Your hands as you stormed
1303,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"At the damsel, denying Him thrice, when she cried:"
1304,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"""He walked at his side!"""
1305,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You, Peter, a wave, a star among clouds, a reed in the wind,"
1306,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"A guide of the blind,"
1307,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Both smiter and flyer, but human alway, I protest,"
1308,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Beyond all the rest.
1309,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,
1310,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,When at night by the boat on the sea He appeared
1311,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Did you wait till he neared?
1312,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You leaped in the water, not dreading the worst"
1313,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,In your joy to be first
1314,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,To greet Him and tell Him of all that had passed
1315,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Since you saw Him the last.
1316,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You had slept while He watched, but fierce were you, fierce and awake"
1317,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"When they sought Him to take,"
1318,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"And cursing, no doubt, as you smote off, as one of the least,"
1319,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,The ear of the priest.
1320,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Then Andrew and all of them fled, but you followed Him,"
1321,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,hoping for strength
1322,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,To save him at length
1323,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Till you lied to the damsel, oh penitent Peter, and crept,"
1324,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Into hiding and wept.
1325,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,
1326,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Oh well! But he asked all the twelve, ""Who am I?"""
1327,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,And who made reply?
1328,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"As you leaped in the sea, so you spoke as you smote with the sword;"
1329,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"""Thou art Christ, even Lord!"""
1330,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"John leaned on His breast, but he asked you, your strength to foresee,"
1331,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"""Nay, lovest thou me?"""
1332,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Thrice over, as thrice you denied Him, and chose you to lead"
1333,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,His sheep and to feed;
1334,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"And gave you, He said, the keys of the den and the fold"
1335,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,To have and to hold.
1336,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You were a poor jailer, oh Peter, the dreamer, who saw"
1337,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,The death of the law
1338,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"In the dream of the vessel that held all the four-footed beasts,"
1339,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Unclean for the priests;
1340,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,And heard in the vision a trumpet that all men are worth
1341,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,The peace of the earth
1342,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"And rapture of heaven hereafter,--oh Peter, what power"
1343,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Was yours in that hour:
1344,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You warder and jailer and sealer of fates and decrees,"
1345,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,To use the big keys
1346,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,With which to reveal and fling wide all the soul and the scheme
1347,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Of the Galilee dream,"
1348,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"When you flashed in a trice, as later you smote with the sword:"
1349,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"""Thou art Christ, even Lord!"""
1350,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,
1351,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"We men, Simon Peter, we men also give you the crown"

1353,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"We write you in capitals, make you the chief"
1354,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Word on the leaf.
1355,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"We know you as one of our flesh, and 'tis well"
1356,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You are warder of hell,"
1357,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,And heaven's gatekeeper forever to bind and to loose--
1358,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Keep the keys if you choose.
1359,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Not rock of you, fire of you make you sublime"
1360,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,In the annals of time.
1361,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"You were called by Him, Peter, a rock, but we give you the name"
1362,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Of Peter the Flame.
1363,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"For you struck a spark, as the spark from the shock"
1364,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Of steel upon rock.
1365,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,The rock has his use but the flame gives the light
1366,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,In the way in the night:--
1367,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,"Oh Peter, the dreamer, impetuous, human, divine,"
1368,SIMON SURNAMED PETER,Gnarled branch of the vine!

1373,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE
1374,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1375,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1376,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,His father had a large family
1377,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of girls and boys and he was born and bred
1378,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,In a barn or kind of cattle shed.
1379,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But he was a hardy youngster and grew to be
1380,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,A boy with eyes that sparkled like a rod
1381,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of white hot iron in the blacksmith shop.
1382,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"His face was ruddy like a rising moon,"
1383,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And his hair was black as sheep's wool that is black.
1384,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And he had rugged arms and legs and a strong back.
1385,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And he had a voice half flute and half bassoon.
1386,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And from his toes up to his head's top
1387,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He was a man, simple but intricate."
1388,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And most men differ who try to delineate
1389,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,His life and fate.
1390,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1391,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,He never seemed ashamed
1392,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of poverty or of his origin. He was a wayward child,"
1393,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Nevertheless though wise and mild,"
1394,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And thoughtful but when angered then he flamed
1395,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,As fire does in a forge.
1396,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,When he was ten years old he ran away
1397,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"To be alone and watch the sea, and the stars"
1398,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,At midnight from a mountain gorge.
1399,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1400,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,When he returned his parents scolded him
1401,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And threatened him with bolts and bars.
1402,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Then they grew soft for his return and gay
1403,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And with their love would have enfolded him.
1404,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But even at ten years old he had a way
1405,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of gazing at you with a look austere
1406,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Which gave his kinfolk fear.
1407,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He had no childlike love for father or mother,"
1408,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Sister or brother,"
1409,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,They were the same to him as any other.
1410,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He was a little cold, a little queer."
1411,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1412,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,His father was a laborer and now
1413,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,They made the boy work for his daily bread.
1414,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,They say he read
1415,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,A book or two during these years of work.
1416,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But if there was a secret prone to lurk
1417,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Between the pages under the light of his brow
1418,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,It came forth. And if he had a woman
1419,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"In love or out of love, or a companion or a chum,"
1420,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,History is dumb.
1421,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,So far as we know he dreamed and worked with hands
1422,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And learned to know his genius' commands
1423,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Or what is called one's dæmon.
1424,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1425,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And this became at last the city's call.
1426,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He had now reached the age of thirty years,"
1427,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And found a Dream of Life and a solution
1428,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For slavery of soul and even all
1429,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Miseries that flow from things material.
1430,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,To free the world was his soul's resolution.
1431,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But his family had great fears
1432,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"For him, knowing the evil"
1433,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Which might befall him, seeing that the light"
1434,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of his own dream had blinded his mind's eyes.
1435,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,They could not tell but what he had a devil.
1436,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"But still in their tears despite,"
1437,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And warnings he departed with replies
1438,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,That when a man's genius calls him
1439,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,He must obey no matter what befalls him.
1440,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1441,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,What he had in his mind was growth
1442,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of soul by watching,"
1443,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And the creation of eyes
1444,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Over your mind's eyes to supervise
1445,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,A clear activity and to ward off sloth.
1446,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,What he had in his mind was scotching
1447,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove
1448,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire
1449,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of Falsehood and Unbrotherly Desire.--
1450,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,What he had in his mind was simply Love.
1451,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And it was strange he preached the sword and force
1452,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"To establish Love, but it was not strange,"
1453,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Since he did this, his life took on a change."
1454,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And what he taught seems muddled at its source
1455,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,With moralizing and with moral strife.
1456,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For morals are merely the Truth diluted
1457,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And sweetened up and suited
1458,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,To the business and bread of Life.
1459,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1460,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And now this City was just what you'd find
1461,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"A city anywhere,"
1462,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"A turmoil and a Vanity Fair,"
1463,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,A sort of heaven and a sort of Tophet.
1464,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,There were so many leaders of his kind
1465,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The city didn't care
1466,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For one additional prophet.
1467,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,He said some extravagant things
1468,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And planted a few stings
1469,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Under the rich man's hide.
1470,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And one of the sensational newspapers
1471,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Gave him a line or two for cutting capers
1472,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,In front of the Palace of Justice and the Church.
1473,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But all of the first grade people took the other side
1474,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of the street when they saw him coming
1475,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With a rag tag crowd singing and humming,"
1476,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And curious boys and men up in a perch
1477,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of a tree or window taking the spectacle in,"
1478,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And the Corybantic din
1479,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of a Salvation Army as it were.
1480,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And whatever he dreamed when he lived in a little town
1481,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"The intelligent people ignored him, and this is the stir"
1482,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And the only stir he made in the city.
1483,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1484,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But there was a certain sinister
1485,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Fellow who came to him hearing of his renown
1486,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And said ""You can be Mayor of this city,"
1487,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"We need a man like you for Mayor."""
1488,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And others said ""You'd make a lawyer or a politician,"
1489,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Look how the people follow you;
1490,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Why don't you hire out as a special writer,"
1491,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"You could become a business man, a rhetorician,"
1492,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"You could become a player,"
1493,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"You can grow rich. There's nothing for a fighter,"
1494,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Fighting as you are, but to end in ruin."""
1495,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But he turned from them on his way pursuing
1496,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The dream he had in view.
1497,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1498,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,He had a rich man or two
1499,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Who took up with him against the powerful frown
1500,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Which looked him down.
1501,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For you'll always find a rich man or two
1502,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,To take up with anything.
1503,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,There are those who can't get into society or bring
1504,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Their riches to a social recognition;
1505,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Or ill-formed souls who lack the real patrician
1506,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Spirit for life.
1507,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"But as for him he didn't care, he passed"
1508,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Where the richness of living was rife.
1509,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And like wise Goethe talking to the last
1510,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,With cabmen rather than with lords
1511,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He sat about the markets and the fountains,"
1512,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He walked about the country and the mountains,"
1513,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Took trips upon the lakes and waded fords
1514,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Barefooted, laughing as a young animal"
1515,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Disports itself amid the festival
1516,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of warm winds, sunshine, summer's carnival--"
1517,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With laborers, carpenters, seamen"
1518,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And some loose women.
1519,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And certain notable sinners
1520,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Gave him dinners.
1521,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And he went to weddings and to places where youth slakes
1522,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Its thirst for happiness, and they served him cakes"
1523,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And wine wherever he went.
1524,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And he ate and drank and spent
1525,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"His time in feasting and in telling stories,"
1526,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And singing poems of lilies and of trees,"
1527,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,With crowds of people crowded around his knees
1528,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,That searched with lightning secrets hidden
1529,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of life and of life's glories,"
1530,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of death and of the soul's way after death.
1531,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1532,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Time makes amends usually for scandal's breath,"
1533,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Which touched him to his earthly ruination.
1534,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"But this city had a Civic Federation,"
1535,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And a certain social order which intrigues
1536,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Through churches, courts, with an endless ramification"
1537,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of money and morals to save itself.
1538,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And this city had a Bar Association,"
1539,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Also its Public Efficiency Leagues
1540,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For laying honest men upon the shelf
1541,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,While making private pelf
1542,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Secure and free to increase.
1543,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And this city had illustrious Pharisees
1544,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And this city had a legion
1545,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of men who make a business of religion,"
1546,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With eyes one inch apart,"
1547,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Dark and narrow of heart,"
1548,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Who give themselves and give the city no peace,"
1549,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And who are everywhere the best police
1550,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For Life as business.
1551,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And when they saw this youth
1552,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Was telling the truth,"
1553,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And that his followers were multiplying,"
1554,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And were going about rejoicing and defying
1555,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The social order and were stirring up
1556,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The dregs of discontent in the cup
1557,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With the hand of their own happiness,"
1558,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,They saw dynamic mysteries
1559,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"In the poems of lilies and trees,"
1560,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Therefore they held him for a felony.
1561,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1562,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,If you will take a kernel of wheat
1563,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And first make free
1564,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The outer flake and then pare off the meat
1565,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of edible starch you'll find at the kernel's core
1566,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,The life germ. And this young man's words were dim
1567,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With blasphemy, sedition at the rim,"
1568,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Which fired the heads of dreamers like new wine.
1569,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But this was just the outward force of him.
1570,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,For this young man's philosophy was more
1571,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Than such external ferment, being divine"
1572,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,With secrets so profound no plummet line
1573,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Can altogether sound it. It means growth
1574,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of soul by watching,"
1575,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And the creation of eyes
1576,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Over your mind's eyes to supervise
1577,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,A clear activity and to ward off sloth.
1578,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,What he had in mind was scotching
1579,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove
1580,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire
1581,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of falsehood and unbrotherly Desire.
1582,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,What he had in mind was simply Love.
1583,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1584,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,But he was prosecuted
1585,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,As a rebel and as a rebel executed
1586,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Right in a public place where all could see.
1587,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And his mother watched him hang for the felony.
1588,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"He hated to die being but thirty-three,"
1589,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And fearing that his poems might be lost.
1590,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And certain members of the Bar Association,"
1591,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And of the Civic Federation,"
1592,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And of the League of Public Efficiency,"
1593,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And a legion
1594,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Of men devoted to religion,"
1595,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"With policemen, soldiers, roughs,"
1596,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Loose women, thieves and toughs,"
1597,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Came out to see him die,"
1598,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And hooted at him giving up the ghost
1599,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,In great despair and with a fearful cry!
1600,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1601,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And after him there was a man named Paul
1602,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Who almost spoiled it all.
1603,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,
1604,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"And protozoan things like hypocrites,"
1605,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,And parasitic things who make a food
1606,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Of the mysteries of God for earthly power
1607,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,Must wonder how before this young man's hour
1608,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"They lived without his blood,"
1609,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,"Shed on that day, and which"
1610,ALL LIFE IN A LIFE,In red cells is so rich.

1635,THE CITY,THE CITY

1637,THE CITY,
1638,THE CITY,The Sun hung like a red balloon
1639,THE CITY,As if he would not rise;
1640,THE CITY,For listless Helios drowsed and yawned.
1641,THE CITY,"He cared not whether the morning dawned,"
1642,THE CITY,The brother of Eos and the Moon
1643,THE CITY,Stretched him and rubbed his eyes.
1644,THE CITY,
1645,THE CITY,He would have dreamed the dream again
1646,THE CITY,That found him under sea:
1647,THE CITY,"He saw Zeus sit by Hera's side,"
1648,THE CITY,He saw Hæphestos with his bride;
1649,THE CITY,He traced from Enna's flowery plain
1650,THE CITY,The child Persephone.
1651,THE CITY,
1652,THE CITY,There was a time when heaven's vault
1653,THE CITY,Cracked like a temple's roof.
1654,THE CITY,"A new hierarchy burst its shell,"
1655,THE CITY,"And as the sapphire ceiling fell,"
1656,THE CITY,"From stern Jehovah's mad assault,"
1657,THE CITY,Vast spaces stretched aloof:
1658,THE CITY,
1659,THE CITY,Great blue black depths of frozen air
1660,THE CITY,Engulfed the soul of Zeus.
1661,THE CITY,And then Jehovah reigned instead.
1662,THE CITY,For Judah was living and Greece was dead.
1663,THE CITY,"And Hope was born to nurse Despair,"
1664,THE CITY,And the Devil was let loose.
1665,THE CITY,
1666,THE CITY,*       *       *       *       *
1667,THE CITY,
1668,THE CITY,Far off in the waste empyrean
1669,THE CITY,The world was a golden mote.
1670,THE CITY,"And the Sun hung like a red balloon,"
1671,THE CITY,Or a bomb afire o'er a barracoon.
1672,THE CITY,"And the sea was drab, and the sea was green"
1673,THE CITY,Like a many colored coat.
1674,THE CITY,
1675,THE CITY,"The sea was pink like cyclamen,"
1676,THE CITY,And red as a blushing rose.
1677,THE CITY,"It shook anon like the sensitive plant,"
1678,THE CITY,Under the golden light aslant.
1679,THE CITY,The little waves patted the shore again
1680,THE CITY,Where the restless river flows.
1681,THE CITY,
1682,THE CITY,And thus it has been for ages gone--
1683,THE CITY,For a hundred thousand years;
1684,THE CITY,"Ere Buddha lived or Jesus came,"
1685,THE CITY,"Or ever the city had place or name,"
1686,THE CITY,The sea thrilled through at the kiss of dawn
1687,THE CITY,Like a soul of smiles and tears.
1688,THE CITY,
1689,THE CITY,"When the city's seat was a waste of sand,"
1690,THE CITY,"And the hydra lived alone,"
1691,THE CITY,"The sound of the sea was here to be heard,"
1692,THE CITY,"And the moon rose up like a great white bird,"
1693,THE CITY,Sailing aloft from the yellow strand
1694,THE CITY,To her silent midnight throne.
1695,THE CITY,
1696,THE CITY,"Now Helios eyes the universe,"
1697,THE CITY,And he knows the world is small.
1698,THE CITY,"Of old he walked through pagan Tyre,"
1699,THE CITY,"Babylon, Sodom destroyed by fire,"
1700,THE CITY,And sought to unriddle the primal curse
1701,THE CITY,That holds the race in thrall.
1702,THE CITY,
1703,THE CITY,So he stepped from the Sun in robes of flame
1704,THE CITY,As the city woke from sleep.
1705,THE CITY,"He walked the markets, walked the squares,"
1706,THE CITY,"He walked the places of sweets and snares,"
1707,THE CITY,"Where men buy honor and barter shame,"
1708,THE CITY,And the weak are killed as sheep.
1709,THE CITY,
1710,THE CITY,He saw the city is one great mart
1711,THE CITY,Where life is bought and sold.
1712,THE CITY,Men rise to get them meat and bread
1713,THE CITY,To barter for drugs or coffin the dead.
1714,THE CITY,And dawn is but a plucked-up heart
1715,THE CITY,For the dreary game of gold.
1716,THE CITY,
1717,THE CITY,"""Ho! ho!"" said Helios, ""father Zeus"
1718,THE CITY,Would never botch it so.
1719,THE CITY,"If he had stolen Joseph's bride,"
1720,THE CITY,And let his son be crucified
1721,THE CITY,The son's blood had been put to use
1722,THE CITY,"To ease the people's woe."""
1723,THE CITY,
1724,THE CITY,"""He of the pest and the burning bush,"
1725,THE CITY,"Of locusts, lice, and frogs,"
1726,THE CITY,"Who made me stand, veiling my light,"
1727,THE CITY,"While Joshua slaughtered the Amorite,"
1728,THE CITY,"Who blacked the skin of the sons of Cush,"
1729,THE CITY,"And builded the synagogues."""
1730,THE CITY,
1731,THE CITY,"""And Jehovah the great is omnipotent,"
1732,THE CITY,While Zeus was bound by Fate.
1733,THE CITY,"But Athens fell when Peter took Rome,"
1734,THE CITY,And Chicago is made His hecatomb.
1735,THE CITY,And since from the hour His son was sent
1736,THE CITY,"The hypocrite holds the state."""
1737,THE CITY,
1738,THE CITY,Helios traversed the city streets
1739,THE CITY,And this is what he saw:
1740,THE CITY,"Some sold their honor, some their skill,"
1741,THE CITY,"The soldier hired himself to kill,"
1742,THE CITY,The judges bartered the judgment seats
1743,THE CITY,And trafficked in the law.
1744,THE CITY,
1745,THE CITY,"The starving artist sold his youth,"
1746,THE CITY,The writer sold his pen;
1747,THE CITY,The lawyer sharpened up his wits
1748,THE CITY,"Like a burglar filing auger bits,"
1749,THE CITY,And Jesus' vicar sold the truth
1750,THE CITY,To the famished sons of men.
1751,THE CITY,
1752,THE CITY,In every heart flamed cruelty
1753,THE CITY,Like a little emerald snake.
1754,THE CITY,And each one knew if he should stand
1755,THE CITY,In another's way the dagger-hand
1756,THE CITY,Would make the stronger the feofee
1757,THE CITY,Of the coveted wapentake.
1758,THE CITY,
1759,THE CITY,There's not a thing men will not do
1760,THE CITY,"For honor, gold, or power."
1761,THE CITY,"We smile and call the city fair,"
1762,THE CITY,"We call life lovely and debonair,"
1763,THE CITY,But Proserpina never grew
1764,THE CITY,So deadly a passion flower.
1765,THE CITY,
1766,THE CITY,Go live for an hour in a tropic land
1767,THE CITY,Hid near a sinking pool:
1768,THE CITY,"The lion and tiger come to drink,"
1769,THE CITY,"The boa crawls to the water's brink,"
1770,THE CITY,The elephant bull kneels down in the sand
1771,THE CITY,And drinks till his throat is cool.
1772,THE CITY,
1773,THE CITY,Jehovah will keep you awhile unseen
1774,THE CITY,As you lie behind the rocks.
1775,THE CITY,"But go, if you dare, to slake your thirst,"
1776,THE CITY,Though Jesus died for our life accursed
1777,THE CITY,Your bones by the tiger will be licked clean
1778,THE CITY,As he licks the bones of an ox.
1779,THE CITY,
1780,THE CITY,"And the sky may be blue as fleur de lis,"
1781,THE CITY,And the earth be tulip red;
1782,THE CITY,"And God in heaven, and life all good"
1783,THE CITY,While you lie hid in the underwood:
1784,THE CITY,And the city may leave you sorrow free
1785,THE CITY,If you ask it not for bread.
1786,THE CITY,
1787,THE CITY,One day Achilles lost a horse
1788,THE CITY,"While the pest at Troy was rife,"
1789,THE CITY,And a million maggots fought and ate
1790,THE CITY,"Like soldiers storming a city's gate,"
1791,THE CITY,"And Thersites said, as he looked at the corse,"
1792,THE CITY,"""Achilles, that is life."""

1794,THE CITY,*       *       *       *       *
1795,THE CITY,
1796,THE CITY,Day fades and from a million cells
1797,THE CITY,The office people pour.
1798,THE CITY,Like bees that crawl on the honeycomb
1799,THE CITY,"The workers scurry to what is home,"
1800,THE CITY,And trains and traffic and clanging bells
1801,THE CITY,Make the cañon highways roar.
1802,THE CITY,
1803,THE CITY,Helios walked the city's ways
1804,THE CITY,Till the lights began to shine.
1805,THE CITY,Then the janitor women start to scrub
1806,THE CITY,"And the Pharisees up and enter the club,"
1807,THE CITY,"And the harlot wakes, and the music plays"
1808,THE CITY,And the glasses glow with wine.
1809,THE CITY,
1810,THE CITY,"Now we're good fellows one and all,"
1811,THE CITY,And the buffet storms with talk.
1812,THE CITY,"""The market's closed and trade's at end"
1813,THE CITY,"We had our battle, now I'm your friend."""
1814,THE CITY,And thanks to the spirit of alcohol
1815,THE CITY,Men go for a ride or walk.
1816,THE CITY,
1817,THE CITY,Oh but traffic is not all done
1818,THE CITY,Nor everything yet sold.
1819,THE CITY,"There's woman to win, and plots to weave,"
1820,THE CITY,"There's a heart to hurt, or one to deceive,"
1821,THE CITY,And bargains to bind ere rise of Sun
1822,THE CITY,To garner the morrow's gold.
1823,THE CITY,
1824,THE CITY,The market at night is as full of fraud
1825,THE CITY,As the market kept by day.
1826,THE CITY,"The courtesan buys a soul with a look,"
1827,THE CITY,"A dinner tempers the truth in a book,"
1828,THE CITY,"And love is sold till love is a bawd,"
1829,THE CITY,And falsehood froths in the play.
1830,THE CITY,
1831,THE CITY,And men and women sell their smiles
1832,THE CITY,For friendship's lifeless dregs.
1833,THE CITY,For fear of the morrow we bend and bow
1834,THE CITY,To moneybags with the slanting brow.
1835,THE CITY,For the heart that knows life's little wiles
1836,THE CITY,Seldom or never begs.
1837,THE CITY,
1838,THE CITY,"""Poor men,"" sighed Helios, ""how they long"
1839,THE CITY,For the ultimate fire of love.
1840,THE CITY,"They yearn, through life, like the peacock moth,"
1841,THE CITY,And die worn out in search of the troth.
1842,THE CITY,For love in the soul is the siren song
1843,THE CITY,"That wrecks the peace thereof."""

1846,THE CITY,
1847,THE CITY,Helios turned from the world and fled
1848,THE CITY,As the convent bell tolled six.
1849,THE CITY,For he caught a glimpse of an agéd crone
1850,THE CITY,Who knelt beside a coffin alone;
1851,THE CITY,She had sold her cloak to shrive the dead
1852,THE CITY,And buy a crucifix!
1853,THE CITY,
1854,THE CITY,

1856,THE CITY,
1857,THE IDIOT,THE IDIOT
1858,THE IDIOT,
1859,THE IDIOT,
1860,THE IDIOT,Two children in a garden
1861,THE IDIOT,Shouting for joy
1862,THE IDIOT,"Were playing dolls and houses,"
1863,THE IDIOT,A girl and boy.
1864,THE IDIOT,"I smiled at a neighbor window,"
1865,THE IDIOT,And watched them play
1866,THE IDIOT,Under a budding oak tree
1867,THE IDIOT,On a wintry day.
1868,THE IDIOT,
1869,THE IDIOT,And then a board half broken
1870,THE IDIOT,In the high fence
1871,THE IDIOT,"Fell over and there entered,"
1872,THE IDIOT,"I know not whence,"
1873,THE IDIOT,A jailbird face of yellow
1874,THE IDIOT,"With a vacant sulk,"
1875,THE IDIOT,His body was a sickly
1876,THE IDIOT,Thing of bulk.
1877,THE IDIOT,
1878,THE IDIOT,"His open mouth was slavering,"
1879,THE IDIOT,And a green light
1880,THE IDIOT,"Turned disc-like in his eyeballs,"
1881,THE IDIOT,Like a dog's at night.
1882,THE IDIOT,"His teeth were like a giant's,"
1883,THE IDIOT,And far apart;
1884,THE IDIOT,I saw him reel on the children
1885,THE IDIOT,With a stopping heart.
1886,THE IDIOT,He trampled their dolls and ruined
1887,THE IDIOT,The house they made;
1888,THE IDIOT,He struck to earth the children
1889,THE IDIOT,With a dirty spade.
1890,THE IDIOT,As a tiger growls with an antelope
1891,THE IDIOT,"After the hunt,"
1892,THE IDIOT,Over the little faces
1893,THE IDIOT,I heard him grunt.
1894,THE IDIOT,
1895,THE IDIOT,"I stood at the window frozen,"
1896,THE IDIOT,"And short of breath,"
1897,THE IDIOT,And then I saw the idiot
1898,THE IDIOT,Was Master Death!
1899,THE IDIOT,
1900,THE IDIOT,A bird in the lilac bushes
1901,THE IDIOT,Began to sing.
1902,THE IDIOT,The garden colored before me
1903,THE IDIOT,To the kiss of spring.
1904,THE IDIOT,And the yellow face in a moment

1966,HELEN OF TROY,On folded wing.
1967,HELEN OF TROY,

1975,HELEN OF TROY,Beneath that ancient sky
1976,HELEN OF TROY,Who is not fain to fly
1977,HELEN OF TROY,As men have fled?

2339,A STUDY,
2340,A STUDY,"If your thoughts were as clear as your eyes,"
2341,A STUDY,"And the whole of your heart were true,"
2342,A STUDY,You were fitter by far for winning--
2343,A STUDY,But then that would not be you.
2344,A STUDY,
2345,A STUDY,If your pulse beat time to love
2346,A STUDY,"As fast as you think and plan,"
2347,A STUDY,You could kindle a lasting passion
2348,A STUDY,In the breast of the strongest man.
2349,A STUDY,
2350,A STUDY,"If you felt as much as you thought,"
2351,A STUDY,"And dreamed what you seem to dream,"
2352,A STUDY,A world of elysian beauty
2353,A STUDY,Your ruined heart would redeem.
2354,A STUDY,
2355,A STUDY,"If you thought in the light of the sun,"
2356,A STUDY,"Or the blood in your veins flowed free,"
2357,A STUDY,"If you gave your kisses but gladly,"
2358,A STUDY,We two could better agree.
2359,A STUDY,
2360,A STUDY,"If you were strong where I counted,"
2361,A STUDY,"And weak where yourself were at stake,"
2362,A STUDY,"You would have my strength for your giving,"
2363,A STUDY,You would gain and not lose for my sake.
2364,A STUDY,
2365,A STUDY,"If your heart overruled your head,"
2366,A STUDY,"Or your head were lord of your heart,"
2367,A STUDY,"Or the two were lovingly balanced,"
2368,A STUDY,I think we never should part.
2369,A STUDY,
2370,A STUDY,"If you came to me spite of yourself,"
2371,A STUDY,"And staid not away through design,"
2372,A STUDY,These days of loving and living
2373,A STUDY,Were sweet as Olympian wine.
2374,A STUDY,
2375,A STUDY,"If you could weep with another,"
2376,A STUDY,"And tears for yourself controlled,"
2377,A STUDY,You could waken and hold to a pity
2378,A STUDY,"You waken, but do not hold."
2379,A STUDY,
2380,A STUDY,If your lips were as fain to speak
2381,A STUDY,As your face is fashioned to hide--
2382,A STUDY,You would know that to lay up treasure
2383,A STUDY,A woman's heart must confide.
2384,A STUDY,
2385,A STUDY,"If your bosom were something richer,"
2386,A STUDY,"Or your hands more fragile and thin,"
2387,A STUDY,"You would call what the world calls evil,"
2388,A STUDY,Or sin and be glad of the sin.
2389,A STUDY,
2390,A STUDY,"If your soul were aflame with love,"
2391,A STUDY,"Or your head were devoted to truth,"
2392,A STUDY,You never would toss on your pillow
2393,A STUDY,Bewildered 'twixt rapture and ruth.
2394,A STUDY,
2395,A STUDY,"If you were the you of my dreams,"
2396,A STUDY,"And the you of my dreams were mine,"
2397,A STUDY,"These days, half sweet and half bitter,"
2398,A STUDY,Would taste like Olympian wine.
2399,A STUDY,
2400,A STUDY,"Oh, subtle and mystic Egyptians!"
2401,A STUDY,"Who chiseled the Sphinx in the East,"
2402,A STUDY,"With head and the breasts of a woman,"
2403,A STUDY,And body and claws of a beast.
2404,A STUDY,
2405,A STUDY,And gave her a marvellous riddle
2406,A STUDY,That the eyeless should read as he ran:
2407,A STUDY,What crawls and runs and is baffled
2408,A STUDY,"By woman, the sphinx--but a man?"
2409,A STUDY,
2410,A STUDY,"Many look in her face and are conquered,"
2411,A STUDY,Where one all her heart has explored;
2412,A STUDY,"A thousand have made her their sovereign,"
2413,A STUDY,But one is her sovereign and lord.
2414,A STUDY,
2415,A STUDY,For him she leaps from her standard
2416,A STUDY,"And fawns at his feet in the sand,"
2417,A STUDY,"Who sees that himself is her riddle,"
2418,A STUDY,And she but the work of his hand.

2424,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2425,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2426,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"The pathos in your face is like a peace,"
2427,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,It is like resignation or a grace
2428,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Which smiles at the surcease
2429,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Of hope. But there is in your face
2430,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"The shadow of pain, and there is a trace"
2431,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Of memory of pain.
2432,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2433,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"I look at you again and again,"
2434,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And hide my looks lest your quick eye perceives
2435,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,My search for your despair.
2436,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,I look at your pale hands--I look at your hair;
2437,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"And I watch you use your hands, I watch the flare"
2438,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Of thought in your eyes like light that interweaves
2439,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,A flutter of color running under leaves--
2440,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Such anguished dreams in your eyes!
2441,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And I listen to you speak
2442,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Words like crystals breaking with a tinkle,"
2443,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Or a star's twinkle.
2444,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Sometimes as we talk you rise
2445,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"And leave the room, and then I rub a streak"
2446,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Of a tear from my cheek.
2447,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2448,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,You tell me such magical things
2449,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Of pictures, books, romance"
2450,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And of your life in France
2451,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"In the varied music of exquisite words,"
2452,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And in a voice that sings.
2453,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2454,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"All things are memory now with you,"
2455,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,For poverty girds
2456,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Your hopes, and only your dreams remain."
2457,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And sometimes here and there
2458,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"I see as you turn your head a whitened hair,"
2459,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Even when you are smiling most.
2460,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"And a light comes in your eyes like a passing ghost,"
2461,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And a color runs through your cheeks as fresh
2462,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,As burns in a girl's flesh.
2463,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Then I can shut my eyes and feel the pain
2464,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"That has become a part of you, though I feign"
2465,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Laughter myself. One sees another's bruise
2466,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And shakes his thought out of it shuddering.
2467,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,So I turn and clamp my will lest I bring
2468,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Your sorrow into my flesh, who cannot choose"
2469,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"But hear your words and laughter,"
2470,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And watch your hands and eyes.
2471,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2472,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Then as I think you over after
2473,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"I have gone from you, and your face"
2474,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Comes to me with its grace
2475,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Of memory of unfound love:
2476,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,You seem to me the image of all women
2477,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Who dream and keep under smiles the grief thereof,"
2478,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Or sew, or sit by windows, or read books"
2479,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,To hide their Secret's looks.
2480,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And after a time go out of life and leave
2481,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,No uttered words but in their silence grieve
2482,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,For Life and for the things no tongue can tell:
2483,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Why Life hurts so, and why Love haunts and hurts"
2484,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Poor men and women in this demi-hell.
2485,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,
2486,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Perhaps your pathos means that it is well
2487,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,"Death in his time the aspiring torch inverts,"
2488,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,And all tired flesh and haunted eyes and hands
2489,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,Moving in painéd whiteness are put under
2490,PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN,The soothing earth to brighten April's wonder.

2495,IN THE CAGE,IN THE CAGE
2496,IN THE CAGE,
2497,IN THE CAGE,
2498,IN THE CAGE,The sounds of mid-night trickle into the roar
2499,IN THE CAGE,Of morning over the water growing blue.
2500,IN THE CAGE,At ten o'clock the August sunbeams pour
2501,IN THE CAGE,A blinding flood on Michigan Avenue.
2502,IN THE CAGE,
2503,IN THE CAGE,But yet the half-drawn shades of bottle green
2504,IN THE CAGE,Leave the recesses of the room
2505,IN THE CAGE,With misty auras drawn around their gloom
2506,IN THE CAGE,"Where things lie undistinguished, scarcely seen."
2507,IN THE CAGE,
2508,IN THE CAGE,"You, standing between the window and the bed"
2509,IN THE CAGE,Are edged with rainbow colors. And I lie
2510,IN THE CAGE,Drowsy with quizzical half-open eye
2511,IN THE CAGE,"Musing upon the contour of your head,"
2512,IN THE CAGE,"Watching you comb your hair,"
2513,IN THE CAGE,"Clothed in a corset waist and skirt of silk,"
2514,IN THE CAGE,Tied with white braid above your slender hips
2515,IN THE CAGE,Which reaches to your knees and makes your bare
2516,IN THE CAGE,And delicate legs by contrast white as milk.
2517,IN THE CAGE,And as you toss your head to comb its tresses
2518,IN THE CAGE,They flash upon me like long strips of sand
2519,IN THE CAGE,"Between a moonlit sea, pale as your hand,"
2520,IN THE CAGE,And a red sun that on a high dune stresses
2521,IN THE CAGE,Its sanguine heat.
2522,IN THE CAGE,
2523,IN THE CAGE,"And then at times your lips,"
2524,IN THE CAGE,Protruding half unconscious half in scorn
2525,IN THE CAGE,Engage my eyes while looking through the morn
2526,IN THE CAGE,At the clear oval of your brow brought full
2527,IN THE CAGE,Over the sovereign largeness of your eyes;
2528,IN THE CAGE,Or at your breasts that shake not as you pull
2529,IN THE CAGE,"The comb through stubborn tangles, only rise"
2530,IN THE CAGE,"Scarcely perceptible with breath or signs,"
2531,IN THE CAGE,"Firm unmaternal like a young Bacchante's,"
2532,IN THE CAGE,Or at your nose profoundly dipped like Dante's
2533,IN THE CAGE,Over your chin that softly melts away.
2534,IN THE CAGE,
2535,IN THE CAGE,Now you seem fully under my heart's sway.
2536,IN THE CAGE,I have slipped through the magic of your mesh
2537,IN THE CAGE,"Freed once again and strengthened by your flesh,"
2538,IN THE CAGE,You seem a weak thing for a strong man's play.
2539,IN THE CAGE,Yet I know now that we shall scarce have parted
2540,IN THE CAGE,When I shall think of you half heavy hearted.
2541,IN THE CAGE,I know our partings. You will faintly smile
2542,IN THE CAGE,"And look at me with eyes that have no guile,"
2543,IN THE CAGE,"Or have too much, and pass into the sphere"
2544,IN THE CAGE,Where you keep independent life meanwhile.
2545,IN THE CAGE,"How do you live without me, is the fear?"
2546,IN THE CAGE,"You do not lean upon me, ask my love, or wonder"
2547,IN THE CAGE,Of other loves I may have hidden under
2548,IN THE CAGE,These casual renewals of our love.
2549,IN THE CAGE,"And if I loved you I should lie in flame,"
2550,IN THE CAGE,"Ari, go about re-murmuring your name,"
2551,IN THE CAGE,And these are things a man should be above.
2552,IN THE CAGE,
2553,IN THE CAGE,And as I lie here on the imminent brink
2554,IN THE CAGE,"Of soul's surrender into your soul's power,"
2555,IN THE CAGE,And in the white light of the morning hour
2556,IN THE CAGE,I see what life would be if we should link
2557,IN THE CAGE,Our lives together in a marriage pact:
2558,IN THE CAGE,For we would walk along a boundless tract
2559,IN THE CAGE,Of perfect hell; but your disloyalty
2560,IN THE CAGE,"Would be of spirit, for I have not won"
2561,IN THE CAGE,Mastered and bound your spirit unto me.
2562,IN THE CAGE,And if you had a lover in the way
2563,IN THE CAGE,I have you it would not by half betray
2564,IN THE CAGE,"My love as does your vague and chainless thought,"
2565,IN THE CAGE,"Which wanders, soars or vanishes, returns,"
2566,IN THE CAGE,"Changes, astonishes, or chills or burns,"
2567,IN THE CAGE,"Is unresisting, plastic, freely wrought"
2568,IN THE CAGE,Under my hands yet to no unison
2569,IN THE CAGE,Of my life and of yours. Upon this brink
2570,IN THE CAGE,I watch you now and think
2571,IN THE CAGE,Of all that has been preached or sung or spoken
2572,IN THE CAGE,Of woman's tragedy in woman's fall;
2573,IN THE CAGE,And all the pictures of a woman broken
2574,IN THE CAGE,By man's superior strength.
2575,IN THE CAGE,
2576,IN THE CAGE,And there you stand
2577,IN THE CAGE,Your heart and life as firmly in command
2578,IN THE CAGE,"Of your resolve as mine is, knowing all"
2579,IN THE CAGE,"Of man, the master, and his power to harm,"
2580,IN THE CAGE,"His rulership of spheres material,"
2581,IN THE CAGE,"Bread, customs, rules of fair repute--"
2582,IN THE CAGE,What are they all against your slender arm?
2583,IN THE CAGE,Which long since plucked the fruit
2584,IN THE CAGE,"Of good and evil, and of life at last"
2585,IN THE CAGE,And now of Life. For dancing you have cast
2586,IN THE CAGE,Veil after veil of ideals or pretense
2587,IN THE CAGE,With which men clothe the being feminine
2588,IN THE CAGE,To satisfy their lordship or their sense
2589,IN THE CAGE,Of ownership and hide the things of sin--
2590,IN THE CAGE,You have thrown them aside veil after veil;
2591,IN THE CAGE,"And there you stand unarmored, weirdly frail,"
2592,IN THE CAGE,"Yet strong as nature, making comical"
2593,IN THE CAGE,The poems and the tales of woman's fall....
2594,IN THE CAGE,"You nod your head, you smile, I feel the air"
2595,IN THE CAGE,Made by the closing door. I lie and stare
2596,IN THE CAGE,"At the closed door. One, two, your tuftèd steps"
2597,IN THE CAGE,Die on the velvet of the outer hall.
2598,IN THE CAGE,You have escaped. And I would not pursue.
2599,IN THE CAGE,"Though we are but caged creatures, I and you--"
2600,IN THE CAGE,A male and female tiger in a zoo.
2601,IN THE CAGE,For I shall wait you. Life himself will track
2602,IN THE CAGE,"Your wanderings and bring you back,"
2603,IN THE CAGE,And shut you up again with me and cage
2604,IN THE CAGE,Our love and hatred and our silent rage.

2621,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,

2640,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,Was a dream of the man who was first.
2641,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,
2642,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,And all the deceit and lust of men
2643,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,Had sharpened her own deceit;
2644,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,And down to the gates of hell she led
2645,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,Her friend with her flying feet.
2646,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,
2647,SAVING A WOMAN: ONE PHASE,"For a bitten bud will never bloom,"

2682,ON A BUST,
2683,ON A BUST,
2684,ON A BUST,Your speeches seemed to answer for the nonce--
2685,ON A BUST,They do not justify your head in bronze!
2686,ON A BUST,Your essays! talent's failures were to you
2687,ON A BUST,"Your philosophic gamut, but things true,"
2688,ON A BUST,"Or beautiful, oh never! What's the pons"
2689,ON A BUST,For you to cross to fame?--Your head in bronze?
2690,ON A BUST,
2691,ON A BUST,What has the artist caught? The sensual chin
2692,ON A BUST,"That melts away in weakness from the skin,"
2693,ON A BUST,Sagging from your indifference of mind;
2694,ON A BUST,The sullen mouth that sneers at human kind
2695,ON A BUST,For lack of genius to create or rule;
2696,ON A BUST,"The superficial scorn that says ""you fool!"""
2697,ON A BUST,The deep-set eyes that have the mud-cat look
2698,ON A BUST,Which might belong to Tolstoi or a crook.
2699,ON A BUST,"The nose half-thickly fleshed and half in point,"
2700,ON A BUST,And lightly turned awry as out of joint;
2701,ON A BUST,"The eyebrows pointing upward satyr-wise,"
2702,ON A BUST,"Scarce like Mephisto, for you scarcely rise"
2703,ON A BUST,To cosmic irony in what you dream--
2704,ON A BUST,More like a tomcat sniffing yellow cream.
2705,ON A BUST,The brow! 'Tis worth the bronze it's molded in
2706,ON A BUST,Save for the flat-top head and narrow thin
2707,ON A BUST,Backhead which shows your spirit has not soared.

2709,ON A BUST,"Which wrecks itself and turtles with its load,"

2711,ON A BUST,The master strength for twisting words is caught
2712,ON A BUST,In the swift turning wheels of iron thought.
2713,ON A BUST,With butcher knives your hands can vivisect
2714,ON A BUST,"Our butterflies, but you can not erect"
2715,ON A BUST,"Temples of beauty, wisdom. You can crawl"
2716,ON A BUST,"Hungry and subtle over Eden's wall,"

2718,ON A BUST,Full grown as good. You cannot glorify

2720,ON A BUST,To you the world's a fig tree which is curst.

2730,ON A BUST,Of molding clay has caught you for the nonce
2731,ON A BUST,And made your shame our shame--your head in bronze!
2732,ON A BUST,Some day this bust will lie amid old metals
2733,ON A BUST,"Old copper boilers, wires, faucets, kettles."
2734,ON A BUST,Some day it will be melted up and molded
2735,ON A BUST,"In door knobs, inkwells, paper knives, or folded"
2736,ON A BUST,In leaves and wreaths around the capitals
2737,ON A BUST,"Of marble columns, or for arsenals"
2738,ON A BUST,"Fashioned in something, or in course of time"
2739,ON A BUST,"Successively made each of these, from grime"
2740,ON A BUST,"Rescued successively, or made a bell"
2741,ON A BUST,"For fire or worship, who on earth can tell?"
2742,ON A BUST,"One thing is sure, you will not long be dust"
2743,ON A BUST,When this bronze will be broken as a bust
2744,ON A BUST,And given to the junkman to re-sell.
2745,ON A BUST,You know this and the thought of it is hell!

2751,ARABEL,
2752,ARABEL,
2753,ARABEL,"Twists of smoke rise from the limpness of jewelled fingers,"
2754,ARABEL,The softness of Persian rugs hushes the room.
2755,ARABEL,Under a dragon lamp with a shade the color of coral
2756,ARABEL,Sit the readers of poems one by one.
2757,ARABEL,And all the room is in shadow except for the blur
2758,ARABEL,"Of mahogany surface, and tapers against the wall."
2759,ARABEL,
2760,ARABEL,And a youth reads a poem of love: forever and ever
2761,ARABEL,Is his soul the soul of the loved one; a woman sings
2762,ARABEL,Of the nine months which go to the birth of a soul.
2763,ARABEL,And after a time under the lamp a man
2764,ARABEL,Begins to read a letter having no poem to read.
2765,ARABEL,And the words of the letter flash and die like a fuse
2766,ARABEL,Dampened by rain--it's a dying mind that writes
2767,ARABEL,What Byron did for the Greeks against the Turks.
2768,ARABEL,And a sickness enters our hearts. The jewelled hands
2769,ARABEL,Clutch at the arms of the chairs--about the room
2770,ARABEL,"One hears the parting of lips, and a nervous shifting"
2771,ARABEL,Of feet and arms.
2772,ARABEL,
2773,ARABEL,And I look up and over
2774,ARABEL,The reader's shoulder and see the name of the writer.
2775,ARABEL,What is it I see? The name of a man I knew!
2776,ARABEL,"You are an ironical trickster, Time, to bring"
2777,ARABEL,After so many years and into a place like this
2778,ARABEL,This face before me: hair slicked down and parted
2779,ARABEL,"In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness,"
2780,ARABEL,"Plump from camembert and clicquot, eyelids"
2781,ARABEL,"Thin as skins of onions, cut like dough 'round the eyes."
2782,ARABEL,Such was your look in a photograph I saw
2783,ARABEL,In a silver frame on a woman's dresser--and such
2784,ARABEL,"Your look in life, you thing of flesh alone!"
2785,ARABEL,
2786,ARABEL,And then
2787,ARABEL,As a soul looks down on the body it leaves--
2788,ARABEL,A body by fever slain--I look on myself
2789,ARABEL,"As I was a decade ago, while the letter is read:"
2790,ARABEL,
2791,ARABEL,I enter a box
2792,ARABEL,"Of a theater with Jim, my friend of fifty,"
2793,ARABEL,I being twenty-two. Two women are in the box
2794,ARABEL,One of an age for Jim and one of an age for me.
2795,ARABEL,"And mine is dressed in a dainty gown of dimity,"
2796,ARABEL,And she fans herself with a fan of silver spangles
2797,ARABEL,Till a subtle odor of delicate powder or of herself
2798,ARABEL,"Enters my blood and I stare at her snowy neck,"
2799,ARABEL,And the glossy brownness of her hair until
2800,ARABEL,"She feels my stare, and turns half-view and I see"
2801,ARABEL,"How like a Greek's is her nose, with just a little"
2802,ARABEL,"Aquiline touch; and I catch the flash of an eye,"
2803,ARABEL,And the glint of a smile on the richness of her lips.
2804,ARABEL,The company now discourses upon the letter
2805,ARABEL,But my dream goes on:
2806,ARABEL,
2807,ARABEL,I re-live a rapture
2808,ARABEL,"Which may be madness, and no man understands"
2809,ARABEL,Until he feels it no more. The youth that was I
2810,ARABEL,From the theater under the city's lights follows the girl
2811,ARABEL,Desperate lest in the city's curious chances
2812,ARABEL,He never sees her again. And boldly he speaks.
2813,ARABEL,"And she and the older woman, her sister"
2814,ARABEL,"Smile and speak in turn, and Jim who stands"
2815,ARABEL,While I break the ice comes up--and so
2816,ARABEL,"Arm in arm we go to the restaurant,"
2817,ARABEL,"I in heaven walking with Arabel,"
2818,ARABEL,And Jim with her older sister.
2819,ARABEL,"We drive them home under a summer moon,"
2820,ARABEL,"And while I explain to Arabel my boldness,"
2821,ARABEL,"And crave her pardon for it, Jim, the devil,"
2822,ARABEL,Laughs apart with her sister while I wonder
2823,ARABEL,"What Jim, the devil, is laughing at. No matter"
2824,ARABEL,To-morrow I walk in the park with Arabel.
2825,ARABEL,
2826,ARABEL,Just now the reader of the letter
2827,ARABEL,Tells of the writer's swift descent
2828,ARABEL,From wealth to want.
2829,ARABEL,
2830,ARABEL,We are in the park next afternoon by the water.
2831,ARABEL,I look at her white throat full as it were of song.
2832,ARABEL,"And her rounded virginal bosom, beautiful!"
2833,ARABEL,"And I study her eyes, I search to the depths her eyes"
2834,ARABEL,In the light of the sun. They are full of little rays
2835,ARABEL,"Like the edge of a fleur de lys, and she smiles"
2836,ARABEL,At first when I fling my soul at her feet.
2837,ARABEL,
2838,ARABEL,"But when I repeat I love her, love her only,"
2839,ARABEL,"A cloud of wonder passes over her face,"
2840,ARABEL,She veils her eyes. The color comes to her cheeks.
2841,ARABEL,And when she picks some clover blossoms and tears them
2842,ARABEL,Her hand is trembling. And when I tell her again
2843,ARABEL,"I love her, love her only, she blots her eyes"
2844,ARABEL,With a handkerchief to hide a tear that starts.
2845,ARABEL,
2846,ARABEL,"And she says to me: ""You do not know me at all,"
2847,ARABEL,How can you love me? You never saw me before
2848,ARABEL,"Last night."" ""Well, tell me about yourself."""
2849,ARABEL,And after a time she tells me the story:
2850,ARABEL,About her father who ran away from her mother;
2851,ARABEL,"And how she hated her father, and how she grieved"
2852,ARABEL,When her mother died; and how a good grandmother
2853,ARABEL,Helped her and helps her now. And how her sister
2854,ARABEL,Divorced her husband. And then she paused a moment:
2855,ARABEL,"""I am not strong, you'd have to guard me gently,"
2856,ARABEL,"And that takes money, dear, as well as love."
2857,ARABEL,"Two years ago I was very ill, and since then"
2858,ARABEL,"I am not strong."""
2859,ARABEL,
2860,ARABEL,"""Well I can work,"" I said."
2861,ARABEL,"""And what would you think of a little cottage"
2862,ARABEL,"Not too far out with a yard and hosts of roses,"
2863,ARABEL,"And a vine on the porch, and a little garden,"
2864,ARABEL,"And a dining room where the sun comes in,"
2865,ARABEL,"When a morning breeze blows over your brow,"
2866,ARABEL,And you sit across the table and serve me
2867,ARABEL,And neither of us can speak for happiness
2868,ARABEL,"Without our voices breaking, or lips trembling."""
2869,ARABEL,
2870,ARABEL,She is looking down with little frowns on her brow.
2871,ARABEL,"""But if ever I had to work, I could not do it,"
2872,ARABEL,"I am not really well."""
2873,ARABEL,
2874,ARABEL,"""But I can work,"" I said."
2875,ARABEL,"I rise and lift her up, holding her hand."
2876,ARABEL,She slips her arm through mine and presses it.
2877,ARABEL,"""What a good man you are,"" she said. ""Just like a brother--"
2878,ARABEL,"I almost love you, I believe I love you."""
2879,ARABEL,
2880,ARABEL,"The reader of the letter, being a doctor,"
2881,ARABEL,Is talking learnedly of the writer's case
2882,ARABEL,Which has the classical marks of paresis.
2883,ARABEL,
2884,ARABEL,Next day I look up Jim and rhapsodize
2885,ARABEL,"About a cottage with roses and a garden,"
2886,ARABEL,"And a dining room where the sun comes in,"
2887,ARABEL,And Arabel across the table. Jim is smoking
2888,ARABEL,"And flicking the ashes, but never says a word"
2889,ARABEL,Till I have finished. Then in a quiet voice:
2890,ARABEL,"""Arabel's sister says that Arabel's straight,"
2891,ARABEL,"But she isn't, my boy--she's just like Arabel's sister."
2892,ARABEL,She knew you had the madness for Arabel.
2893,ARABEL,That's why we laughed and stood apart as we talked.
2894,ARABEL,"And I'll tell you now I didn't go home that night,"
2895,ARABEL,"I shook you at the corner and went back,"
2896,ARABEL,"And staid that night. Now be a man, my boy,"
2897,ARABEL,"Go have your fling with Arabel, but drop"
2898,ARABEL,"The cottage and the roses."""
2899,ARABEL,
2900,ARABEL,They are still discussing the madman's letter.
2901,ARABEL,
2902,ARABEL,And memory permeates me like a subtle drug:
2903,ARABEL,"The memory of my love for Arabel,"
2904,ARABEL,"The torture, the doubt, the fear, the restless longing,"
2905,ARABEL,"The sleepless nights, the pity for all her sorrows,"
2906,ARABEL,"The speculation about her and her sister,"
2907,ARABEL,And what her illness was;
2908,ARABEL,And whether the man I saw one time was leaving
2909,ARABEL,"Her door or the next door to it, and if her door"
2910,ARABEL,Whether he saw my Arabel or her sister....
2911,ARABEL,
2912,ARABEL,The reader of the letter is telling how the writer
2913,ARABEL,Left his wife chasing the lure of women.
2914,ARABEL,
2915,ARABEL,And it all comes back to me as clear as a vision:
2916,ARABEL,The night I sat with Arabel strong but conquered.
2917,ARABEL,"Whatever I did, I loved her, whatever she was."
2918,ARABEL,Madness or love the terrible struggle must end.
2919,ARABEL,"She took my hand and said, ""You must see my room."""
2920,ARABEL,We stood in the doorway together and on her dresser
2921,ARABEL,Was a silver frame with the photograph of a man--
2922,ARABEL,I had seen him in life: hair slicked down and parted
2923,ARABEL,In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness
2924,ARABEL,"Plump from camembert and clicquot, eyelids"
2925,ARABEL,"Thin as skins of onions, cut like dough 'round the eyes."
2926,ARABEL,"""There is his picture,"" she said, ""ask me whatever you will."
2927,ARABEL,"Take me as mistress or wife, it is yours to decide."
2928,ARABEL,"But take me as mistress and grow like the picture before you,"
2929,ARABEL,Take me as wife and be the good man you can be.
2930,ARABEL,Choose me as mistress--how can I do less for dearest?
2931,ARABEL,"Or make me your wife--fate makes me your mistress or wife."""
2932,ARABEL,"""I can leave you,"" I said. ""You can leave me,"" she echoed,"
2933,ARABEL,"""But how about hate in your heart."""
2934,ARABEL,
2935,ARABEL,"""You are right,"" I replied."
2936,ARABEL,
2937,ARABEL,The company is now discussing the subject of love--
2938,ARABEL,They seem to know little about it.
2939,ARABEL,
2940,ARABEL,"But my wife, who is sitting beside me, exclaims:"
2941,ARABEL,"""Well, what is this jangle of madness and weakness,"
2942,ARABEL,"What has it to do with poetry, tell me?"""
2943,ARABEL,
2944,ARABEL,"""Well, it's life,"" Arabel."
2945,ARABEL,"""There's the story of Hamlet, for instance,"" I added."
2946,ARABEL,Then fell into silence.
2947,ARABEL,
2948,ARABEL,
2949,ARABEL,
2950,ARABEL,
2951,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER
2952,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
2953,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
2954,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Last night a friend of mine and I sat talking,"
2955,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,When all at once I found 'twas one o'clock.
2956,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,So we came out and he went home to wife
2957,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And children, and I started for the club"
2958,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Which I call home; and then just like a flash
2959,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,You came into my mind. I bought a slug
2960,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And stood, in the booth, with doubtful heart and heard"
2961,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The buzzer buzz. Well, it was sweet to me"
2962,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"To hear your voice at last--it was so drowsy,"
2963,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Like a child's voice. And I could see your eyes
2964,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Heavy with sleep, and I could see you standing"
2965,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,In nightgown with head leaned against the wall....
2966,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
2967,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Julia! the welcome of your drowsy voice
2968,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Went through me like the warmth of priceless wine--
2969,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"It showed your understanding, that you know"
2970,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"How it is with a man, and how it is with me"
2971,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who work by day and sometimes drift by night
2972,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,About this hellish city. Though you know
2973,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"That I am fifty-one, can you imagine"
2974,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,My feeling with no children growing up?
2975,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,My feeling as of one who sees a play
2976,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And afterwards sits somewhere at a table
2977,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And talks with friends about the different parts
2978,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Over a sandwich and a glass of beer?
2979,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,My feeling with this money which I've made
2980,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And cannot use? Sometimes the stress of working
2981,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,The money dulls the fancy which could use it
2982,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,In splendid dreams or in the art of life.
2983,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Well, here was I ringing your bell at last"
2984,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"At half-past one, and there you stood before me"
2985,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"With a sleepy voice and a sleepy smile, with hands"
2986,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"So warm, and cheeks so red from sleep, not vexed,"
2987,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"But like a child, awakened, who smiles at you"
2988,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"With half-shut eyes and kisses you, so you"
2989,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Gave me a kiss. The world seems better, Julia,"
2990,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,For that kiss which you gave me at the door....
2991,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
2992,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Breakfast? Why, toast and coffee, not too strong,"
2993,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,My heart acts queer of late....
2994,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
2995,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,I want to say
2996,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Lest I forget it, if you ever hear"
2997,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,From Arabel or Francis what I said
2998,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,To Francis when he told me he intended
2999,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"To marry Arabel, why just remember"
3000,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Our talk this morning and forget I said it--
3001,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"I'm sorry that I said it. But, you see,"
3002,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"That night we met, I being fifty-one"
3003,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And old at what men call the game, looked on"
3004,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"With steady eye and quiet nerve, I saw you"
3005,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Just as I'd see a woman anywhere;
3006,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And I found you as I'd found others before you,"
3007,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,But with this difference so it seemed to me:
3008,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"What had been false with them was real with you,"
3009,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"What had been shame with them with you was life,"
3010,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"What had been craft with them with you was nature,"
3011,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"What had been sin with them to you was good,"
3012,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,What had been vice with them to you the honest
3013,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And uncorrupted innocence of a human
3014,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Heart so human looking on our souls.
3015,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,What had been coarse to them to you was clean
3016,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"As rain is, or fresh flowers, all things that grow"
3017,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And move and sing along creation's way.
3018,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"You came to me like friendship, what you gave"
3019,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Was friendship's gift, when friends think least of self"
3020,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And least of motive. And it is through you
3021,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,That I have risen out of the pit where sneers
3022,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And laughter, looks and words obscene,"
3023,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Blaspheme our nature. It is through you, Julia,"
3024,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,As one amid great beach trees where soft mosses
3025,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Pillow our heads and where we see the clouds
3026,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Upon their infinite sailings and the lake
3027,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Washes beneath us, and we lie and think"
3028,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,How this has been forever and will be
3029,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"When we are dust a thousand, thousand years,"
3030,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Yet how life is eternal--just as one
3031,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who there falls into prayer for ecstasy
3032,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of wonder, prophecy could not blaspheme"
3033,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,The Eternal Power (as he might well blaspheme
3034,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,The gospel hymns and ritual) that I
3035,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Cannot blaspheme you, Julia."
3036,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"For what is our communion, yours and mine,"
3037,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,If it be not a way of laying hold
3038,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,On that mysterious essence which makes one
3039,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of heaven and earth, makes kindred human hands...."
3040,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Tears are not like you, Julia; laugh, that's right!"
3041,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Pour me a little coffee, if you please."
3042,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3043,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,I'll take from my herbarium certain species
3044,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,To make my points: Now here there is the woman
3045,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of life promiscuous, or nearly so."
3046,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"She fixes her design upon a man,"
3047,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who's married and the riotous game begins.
3048,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,They go along a year or two perhaps.
3049,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Then psychic chemistry performs its part:
3050,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"They are in love, or he's in love with her."
3051,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,What shall be done with love? Now watch the woman:
3052,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,That which she gave without love at the first
3053,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,She now withdraws in spite of love unless
3054,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"He breaks his life up, cuts all former ties"
3055,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And weds her. Do you wonder sometimes men
3056,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Kill women with a knife or strangle them?
3057,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Well, here's another: She has been to Ogontz,"
3058,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"You meet her at a dinner-dance, we'll say."
3059,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,She has green eyes and hair as light as jonquils;
3060,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,She wears black velvet and a salmon sash.
3061,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And when you dance with her she has a way
3062,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of giving you her flesh beneath thin silk,"
3063,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Which almost lisps as she caresses you
3064,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,With legs that scarcely touch you; and she says
3065,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Things with a double meaning, and she smiles"
3066,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"To carry out her meaning. Well, you think"
3067,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The girl is yours, and after weeks of chasing"
3068,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,She lands you up at the appointed place
3069,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"With mamma, who looks at you with big eyes,"
3070,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,That have a nervous way of opening
3071,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And closing slowly like a big wax doll's,"
3072,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,From which great clouds of wrath and wonder come;
3073,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Which meeting is a way of saying to you:
3074,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The girl is yours if you will marry her,"
3075,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And let her have your money.
3076,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3077,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Julia, be still;"
3078,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,I can't go on while you are laughing so.
3079,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"I know that men are easy, but to see"
3080,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Women as women see them is a gift
3081,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,That comes to men who reach my age in life....
3082,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3083,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Well, here's another, here's the type of woman"
3084,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Whose power of motherhood conceals the art
3085,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"By which she thrives, through which she reaches also"
3086,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,An apotheosis in society.
3087,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Her dream is children conscious or unconscious.
3088,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And her strength is the race's, and she draws"
3089,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,The urgings of posterity and leans
3090,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Upon the hopes and ideals of the day.
3091,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,To her a man must sacrifice his life.
3092,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"But women, Julia, of whatever type,"
3093,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Are still but waiting ovules seeking man,"
3094,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And man's life to develop, even to live."
3095,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And like the praying mantis who's devoured
3096,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"In the embrace, man is devoured by women"
3097,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"In some way, by some sort. Love is a flame"
3098,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,In man's life where he warms him but to suck
3099,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The invisible heat and perish. Life is cramped,"
3100,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Bound down with many ropes, shut in by gates--"
3101,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Love is not free which should be wholly free
3102,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,For Life's sake.
3103,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3104,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,On Michigan Avenue
3105,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"At lunch time, or at five o'clock, you'll see"
3106,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,In rain or shine a certain tailor walk
3107,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"In modish coat and trousers, with a cane."
3108,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,That fellow is the pitifulest man I know.
3109,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"He has no woman, cannot find a woman,"
3110,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Because all women, seeing him, divine"
3111,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"What surges through him, and within their hearts"
3112,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Laugh slyly and deny him for the fun
3113,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Of seeing how denial keeps him walking
3114,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,All up and down the boulevard. He's found
3115,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"No hand of human friendship like yours, Julia."
3116,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,I use him for my point. If we could make
3117,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Some fine erotometer one could sit
3118,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And watch its trembling springs and nervous hands
3119,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Record the waves of longing in the city,"
3120,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And the urge of life that writhes beneath the blows
3121,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of custom and of fear. Love is not free,"
3122,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Which should be wholly free for Life's sake.
3123,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3124,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Julia.
3125,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"So much for all these things, and now for you"
3126,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,To whom they lead.
3127,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3128,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,You'll find among the marshes
3129,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The sundew and the pitcher plant; in shallows,"
3130,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Where the green scum floats languidly you'll find
3131,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,The water lily with white petals and
3132,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,A sickly perfume. But the sundew catches
3133,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The midges flitting by with rainbow wings,"
3134,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Impales them on its tiny spines, in time"
3135,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Devours them. And the pitcher plant holds out
3136,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Its cup of green for larger bugs, which fall"
3137,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Into the water, treasured there like tears"
3138,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of women, and so drowned are soon absorbed"
3139,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Into the verdant vesture of its leaves.
3140,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"The pitcher plant and sundew, water lily"
3141,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Well typify the nature of most women
3142,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who must have blood or soul of man to live--
3143,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Except you, Julia. For my friend at Hinsdale"
3144,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who raises flowers laid out a primrose bed.
3145,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,He read somewhere that primroses will change
3146,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Under your eyes sometimes to something else,"
3147,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Become another flower and not a primrose,"
3148,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Another species even. So he watched
3149,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"And saw it, saw this miracle! The seed"
3150,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Has somewhere in its vital self the power
3151,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Of this mutation. What is the origin
3152,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Of spiritual species? For you're a primrose, Julia,"
3153,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who has mutated: You are not a mother;
3154,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Nor are you yet the woman seeking marriage;
3155,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Nor yet the woman thriving by her sex;
3156,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Nor yet the woman spoken of by Solomon
3157,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Who waits and watches and whose steps lead down
3158,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,To death and hell. Nor yet Delilah who
3159,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,Rejoices in the secret of man's strength
3160,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And in subduing it.
3161,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,
3162,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,You are a flower
3163,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"Designed to comfort such poor men as I,"
3164,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And show the world how love can be a thing
3165,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"That asks no more than what it freely gives,"
3166,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,And gives all--all some women call the prize
3167,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"For life or honor, riches, power or place."
3168,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,You are a blossom in the primrose bed
3169,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"So raised to subtler color, sweeter scent."
3170,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,"You have mutated, Julia, that is it,"
3171,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,This flower of you is what I call _The Lover_!
3172,JIM AND ARABEL'S SISTER,

3176,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES
3177,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3178,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3179,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,I have seen many faces changed by the Sculptor Death--
3180,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,But never a face like Harold's who passed in a throe of pain.
3181,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"There were maidens and youths in the bud, and men in the lust of life;"
3182,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And women whom child-birth racked till the crying soul slipped through;
3183,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Patriarchs withered with age and nuns ascetical white;
3184,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And one who wasted her virgin wealth in a riot of joy.
3185,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"Brothers and sisters at last in a quiet and purple pall,"
3186,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"Fellow voyagers bound to a port on an ash-blue sea,"
3187,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"Locked in an utterless grief, in a mystery fearful to dream."
3188,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,All of these I have seen--but the face of Harold the bold
3189,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Looked with a penitent pallor and stared with a sad surprise.
3190,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3191,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,For now at last he was still who never knew rest in life.
3192,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And the ardent heat of his blood was cold as the sweat of a stone.
3193,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Life came in an evil hour and stabbed with a poisoned word
3194,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,The heart of a girl who faintly smiled through her tears.
3195,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And her little life was tossed as the eddies that whirl in the hollows
3196,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,From the great world-currents that wreck the battle ships at sea.
3197,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And the face of dead Lillian seemed like a rain-ruined flower.
3198,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3199,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Or what is writ on the brow of the babe as the mother wails for the day
3200,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,When it leaped in the light of the sun and babbled its pure delight?
3201,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3202,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,But the face of William the Great was fashioned by life and thought;
3203,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"And death made it massive as bronze, and deepened the lines thereof:"
3204,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"Some for the will and some for patience, and some for hope--"
3205,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Hope for the weal of the world wherein he mightily strove--
3206,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"Yet what did it all bespeak--what but submission and awe,"
3207,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,And a trace of pain as one with a sword in his side?
3208,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3209,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,I have seen many faces changed by the Sculptor Death
3210,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,But the sorrow thereof is dumb like the cloth that lies on the brow.
3211,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,"So what should be said of the faun surprised in the woodland dances,"
3212,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,Of Harold the light of heart who fought with fear to the last?
3213,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,
3214,THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES,

3218,THE CRY,
3219,THE CRY,
3220,THE CRY,There's a voice in my heart that cries and cries for tears.
3221,THE CRY,"It is not a voice, but a pain of many fears."
3222,THE CRY,"It is not a pain, but the rune of far-off spheres."
3223,THE CRY,
3224,THE CRY,"It may be a dæmon of pent and high emprise,"
3225,THE CRY,"That looks on my soul till my soul hides and cries,"
3226,THE CRY,Loath to rebuke my soul and bid it arise.
3227,THE CRY,
3228,THE CRY,"It may be myself as I was in another life,"
3229,THE CRY,"Fashioned to lead where strife gives way to strife,"
3230,THE CRY,Pinioned here in failure by knife thrown after knife.
3231,THE CRY,
3232,THE CRY,The child turns o'er in the womb; and perhaps the soul
3233,THE CRY,"Nurtures a dream too strong for the soul's control,"
3234,THE CRY,"When the dream hath eyes, and senses its destined goal."
3235,THE CRY,
3236,THE CRY,Deep in darkness the bulb under mould and clod
3237,THE CRY,Feels the sun in the sky and pushes above the sod;
3238,THE CRY,Perhaps this cry in my heart is nothing but God!

3248,THE HELPING HAND,
3249,THE HELPING HAND,"Mother, my soul is crucified, my thirst is past belief."
3250,THE HELPING HAND,"How are you crucified, my son, betwixt a thief and thief?"
3251,THE HELPING HAND,
3252,THE HELPING HAND,"Mother, I feel the terror and the loveliness of life."
3253,THE HELPING HAND,"Tell me of the children, son, and tell me of the wife."
3254,THE HELPING HAND,
3255,THE HELPING HAND,"Mother, your face is but a face among a million more."
3256,THE HELPING HAND,"You're standing on the deck, my son, and looking at the shore."
3257,THE HELPING HAND,
3258,THE HELPING HAND,"I lean against the wall, mother, and struggle hard for breath."
3259,THE HELPING HAND,"You must have heard the step, my son, of the patrolman Death."
3260,THE HELPING HAND,
3261,THE HELPING HAND,"Mother, my soul is weary, where is the way to God?"

3273,THE DOOR,There is no door but death.
3274,THE DOOR,
3275,THE DOOR,Do shadows crouch within the mocking light?
3276,THE DOOR,Stand thou! but if thy terrored heart takes flight
3277,THE DOOR,"Facing maimed Hope and wide-eyed Nevermore,"
3278,THE DOOR,There is no less one door.
3279,THE DOOR,
3280,THE DOOR,"Dost thou bewail love's end and friendship's doom,"
3281,THE DOOR,"The dying fire, drained cup, and gathering gloom?"
3282,THE DOOR,"Explore the walls, if thy soul ventureth--"
3283,THE DOOR,There is no door but death.
3284,THE DOOR,
3285,THE DOOR,There is no window. Heaven hangs aloof
3286,THE DOOR,Above the rents within the stairless roof.

3301,CIII. 14.,And these blaspheming tongues are dust
3302,CIII. 14.,"Which babbled of Thy name divine,"
3303,CIII. 14.,How helpless then to carp or rail
3304,CIII. 14.,Against the canons of Thy word;

3306,CIII. 14.,"Have mercy, Lord?"

3308,CIII. 14.,Here from this ebon speck that floats

3311,CIII. 14.,Rise to the vault of Thy fair sky:

3313,CIII. 14.,"Of this all-wondering, tortured horde,"

3315,CIII. 14.,"Have mercy, Lord!"
3316,CIII. 14.,
3317,CIII. 14.,Thou knowest that our flesh is grass;
3318,CIII. 14.,Ah! let our withered souls remain

3320,CIII. 14.,"Bleached, in Thy will, by ceaseless rain."
3321,CIII. 14.,"Have we not had enough of fire,"
3322,CIII. 14.,Enough of torment and the sword?--

3325,CIII. 14.,
3326,CIII. 14.,Dost Thou not see about our feet
3327,CIII. 14.,The tangles of our erring thought?

3329,CIII. 14.,High hopes that vanish into naught.
3330,CIII. 14.,"We bleed, we fall, we rise again;"
3331,CIII. 14.,How can we be of Thee abhorred?

3345,CIII. 14.,And strength that leaves us while we seek.
3346,CIII. 14.,Thou pourest the fire of sacred rage
3347,CIII. 14.,In costly vessels all too weak.
3348,CIII. 14.,Great works we planned in hopes that Thou
3349,CIII. 14.,Fit wisdom therefor wouldst accord;

3433,THE CONVERSATION,To something else--that man must pass as well
3434,THE CONVERSATION,Through equal transformation. And You knew

3439,THE CONVERSATION,Over the purple mists that hide the gulf.
3440,THE CONVERSATION,"Ere the green cell rose, even in the green cell"

3444,THE CONVERSATION,Could not envision it. That even worship

3448,THE CONVERSATION,"Which fly and seek each other, maims"

3451,THE CONVERSATION,Ranging from plants through beasts and up to us
3452,THE CONVERSATION,Had ties of filth--And out of them would rise
3453,THE CONVERSATION,Diverse philosophies to tear the world.
3454,THE CONVERSATION,"You knew, when the green cell arose, that even"
3455,THE CONVERSATION,The You which formed it moving on would bring
3456,THE CONVERSATION,"Races and breeds, madmen, tyrants, slaves,"
3457,THE CONVERSATION,"The idiot child, the murderer, the insane--"
3458,THE CONVERSATION,All springing from the action of one law.
3459,THE CONVERSATION,You knew the enmity that lies between
3460,THE CONVERSATION,The lives of micro-beings and our own. You knew
3461,THE CONVERSATION,How man would rise to vision of himself:
3462,THE CONVERSATION,Immortal only in the race's life.
3463,THE CONVERSATION,"And past the atom and the first glint of life,"
3464,THE CONVERSATION,"Saw him with soul enraptured, yet o'ershadowed"
3465,THE CONVERSATION,Amid self-consciousness!
3466,THE CONVERSATION,
3467,THE CONVERSATION,_A Voice_
3468,THE CONVERSATION,
3469,THE CONVERSATION,I knew.
3470,THE CONVERSATION,"But this your fault: You see me as apart,"
3471,THE CONVERSATION,"Over, removed, at enmity with You."
3472,THE CONVERSATION,"You are in Me, and of Me, even at one"
3473,THE CONVERSATION,With Me. But there's your soul--your soul may be
3474,THE CONVERSATION,The germinal cell of vaster evolution.
3475,THE CONVERSATION,Why try to tell you? If I gave a cell
3476,THE CONVERSATION,"Voice to inquire, and it should ask you this:"
3477,THE CONVERSATION,"""After me what, a stalk, a flower, life"
3478,THE CONVERSATION,"That swims or crawls?"" And if I gave to you"
3479,THE CONVERSATION,"Wisdom to say: ""You shall become a reed"
3480,THE CONVERSATION,"By the water's edge""--how could the cell foresee"
3481,THE CONVERSATION,"What the reed is, bending beneath the wind"
3482,THE CONVERSATION,When the lake ripples and the skies are blue
3483,THE CONVERSATION,"As larkspur? Therefore I, who moved in darkness"
3484,THE CONVERSATION,Becoming light in suns and light in souls
3485,THE CONVERSATION,And mind with thought--for what is thought but light
3486,THE CONVERSATION,Sprung from the clash of ether?--I am with you.
3487,THE CONVERSATION,And if beyond this stable state that stands
3488,THE CONVERSATION,For your life here (as cells are whole and balanced
3489,THE CONVERSATION,"Till the inner urge bring union, then a breaking"
3490,THE CONVERSATION,"And building up to higher life), there is"
3491,THE CONVERSATION,"No memory of this world nor of your thought,"
3492,THE CONVERSATION,Nor sense of life on this world lived and borne;
3493,THE CONVERSATION,"Or whether you remember, know yourself"
3494,THE CONVERSATION,"As one who lived here, suffered here, aspired--"
3495,THE CONVERSATION,"What does it matter?--you cannot be lost,"
3496,THE CONVERSATION,As I am lost not. Therefore be at peace.
3497,THE CONVERSATION,And from the laws whose orbits cross and run
3498,THE CONVERSATION,"To seeming tangles, find the law through which"
3499,THE CONVERSATION,"Your soul shall be perfected till it draw,--"
3500,THE CONVERSATION,As the green cell the sunlight draws and turns
3501,THE CONVERSATION,Its chemical effulgence into life--
3502,THE CONVERSATION,My inner splendor. All the rest is mine
3503,THE CONVERSATION,In infinite time. For if I should unroll
3504,THE CONVERSATION,"The parchment of the future, it were vain--"
3505,THE CONVERSATION,You could not read it.

3641,THE ALTAR,My heart is an altar whereon
3642,THE ALTAR,Many sacrificial fires have been kindled
3643,THE ALTAR,In praise of spring and Aphrodite.
3644,THE ALTAR,
3645,THE ALTAR,"My heart is an altar of chalcedony,"
3646,THE ALTAR,"Crowned with a tablet of bronze,"
3647,THE ALTAR,"Blacked with smoke, scarred with fire,"
3648,THE ALTAR,And scented with the aromatic bitterness
3649,THE ALTAR,Of dead incense.
3650,THE ALTAR,
3651,THE ALTAR,Albeit let us murmur a little Doric prayer
3652,THE ALTAR,Over the ashes which lie scattered around the altar;
3653,THE ALTAR,"For the April rain has wept over them,"
3654,THE ALTAR,And from them the crocus smelts its Roman gold.
3655,THE ALTAR,
3656,THE ALTAR,What though there are remnants here
3657,THE ALTAR,"Of faded coronals,"
3658,THE ALTAR,And bits of silver string
3659,THE ALTAR,Torn from forgotten harps?
3660,THE ALTAR,Perfect amid the ashes sleeps a cup of amethyst.
3661,THE ALTAR,"Let us take it and pour the sea from it,"
3662,THE ALTAR,"And while the savor of dead lips is washed away,"
3663,THE ALTAR,Let us lift our hands to this sky of hyacinth.

3665,THE ALTAR,
3666,THE ALTAR,Bring from the re-kindled woodland
3667,THE ALTAR,"Flames of columbine, jewel-weed and trumpet-creeper,"
3668,THE ALTAR,"There where the woodman burns the fallen tree,"
3669,THE ALTAR,And scented smoke arises
3670,THE ALTAR,"On azure wings between the branches,"
3671,THE ALTAR,Budding with adolescent life.
3672,THE ALTAR,"With these let us light the altar,"
3673,THE ALTAR,That a scarlet flame may lean
3674,THE ALTAR,Against the silver sea.
3675,THE ALTAR,
3676,THE ALTAR,"For thou art fire also,"
3677,THE ALTAR,"And air, and water, and the resurgent earth,"
3678,THE ALTAR,"For thou art woman, thou art love."
3679,THE ALTAR,"Thou art April of the Arcadian moon,"
3680,THE ALTAR,"Thou art the swift sun racing through snowy clouds,"
3681,THE ALTAR,Thou art the creative silence of flowering valleys.
3682,THE ALTAR,Thy face is the apple tree in bloom;
3683,THE ALTAR,Thine eyes the glimpses of green water
3684,THE ALTAR,When the tree's blossoms shake
3685,THE ALTAR,As soft winds fan them.
3686,THE ALTAR,Thy hair is flame blown against the sea's mist--
3687,THE ALTAR,Thou art spring.
3688,THE ALTAR,
3689,THE ALTAR,"The fire on the altar burns brightly,"
3690,THE ALTAR,And the sea sparkles in the sun.
3691,THE ALTAR,Let us murmur a Doric prayer
3692,THE ALTAR,"For the gift of love,"
3693,THE ALTAR,"For the gift of life,"
3694,THE ALTAR,Oh Life! Oh Love! We lift our hands to thee!

3702,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her soul is like a wolf that stands
3703,SOUL'S DESIRE,Where sunlight falls between the trees
3704,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Of a sparse forest's leafless edge,"
3705,SOUL'S DESIRE,When Spring's first magic moveth these.
3706,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3707,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Her soul is like a little brook,"
3708,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Thin edged with ice against the leaves,"
3709,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Where the wolf drinks and is alone,"
3710,SOUL'S DESIRE,And where the woodbine interweaves.
3711,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3712,SOUL'S DESIRE,"A bank late covered by the snow,"
3713,SOUL'S DESIRE,But lighted by the frozen North;
3714,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her soul is like a little plot
3715,SOUL'S DESIRE,That one white blossom bringeth forth.
3716,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3717,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Her soul is slim, like silver slips,"

3719,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her soul is like a shape that moves
3720,SOUL'S DESIRE,And changes in a wonder dream.
3721,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3722,SOUL'S DESIRE,"Who would pursue her clasps a cloud,"
3723,SOUL'S DESIRE,And taketh sorrow for his zeal.

3725,SOUL'S DESIRE,While bound upon the torture wheel.
3726,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3727,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her soul is like a wolf that glides
3728,SOUL'S DESIRE,By moonlight o'er a phantom ridge;

3730,SOUL'S DESIRE,Beneath the shadow of a bridge.

3732,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her voice is like a woodland cry
3733,SOUL'S DESIRE,Heard in a summer's desolate hour.

3735,SOUL'S DESIRE,And tinctured like the cuckoo flower.
3736,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3737,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her little breasts are like the buds
3738,SOUL'S DESIRE,Of tulips in a place forlorn.

3745,SOUL'S DESIRE,Save of herself and her desire.
3746,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3747,SOUL'S DESIRE,She is not life; she is not death;
3748,SOUL'S DESIRE,"She is not fear, or joy or grief."
3749,SOUL'S DESIRE,Her soul is like a quiet sea
3750,SOUL'S DESIRE,Beneath a ruin-haunted reef.
3751,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3752,SOUL'S DESIRE,"She is the shape the sailor sees,"
3753,SOUL'S DESIRE,That slips the rock without a sound.
3754,SOUL'S DESIRE,She is the soul that comes and goes
3755,SOUL'S DESIRE,"And leaves no mark, yet makes a wound."
3756,SOUL'S DESIRE,
3757,SOUL'S DESIRE,She is the soul that hunts and flies;
3758,SOUL'S DESIRE,She is a world-wide mist of care.
3759,SOUL'S DESIRE,"She is the restlessness of life,"
3760,SOUL'S DESIRE,Its rapture and despair.

4189,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"Sweet lady, I behold the face"
4190,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"Of thy dear son, our Lord,"
4191,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,"
4192,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,The sun shines on your sword.
4193,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4194,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,Sir Galahad outstretcheth hands
4195,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,And taketh me ere I fail--
4196,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,Sir Launcelot's body lay in death
4197,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,As his soul found the Holy Grail.
4198,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4199,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,They laid his body in the quire
4200,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,Upon a purple pall.
4201,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"He was the meekest, gentlest knight"
4202,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,That ever ate in hall.
4203,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4204,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"He was the kingliest, goodliest knight"
4205,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"That ever England roved,"
4206,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,The truest lover of sinful man
4207,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,That ever woman loved.
4208,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4209,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"I pray you all, fair gentlemen,"
4210,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,Pray for his soul and mine.
4211,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,He lived to lose the heart he loved
4212,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,And drink but bitter wine.
4213,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4214,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"He wrought a woe he knew not of,"
4215,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"He failed his fondest quest,"
4216,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,"Now sing a psalter, read a prayer"
4217,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,May all souls find their rest.
4218,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,Amen.
4219,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4220,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4221,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4222,THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT,
4223,IN MICHIGAN,IN MICHIGAN
4224,IN MICHIGAN,
4225,IN MICHIGAN,
4226,IN MICHIGAN,You wrote:
4227,IN MICHIGAN,"""Come over to Saugatuck"
4228,IN MICHIGAN,"And be with me on the warm sand,"
4229,IN MICHIGAN,"And under cool beeches and aromatic cedars."""
4230,IN MICHIGAN,And just then no one could do a thing in the city
4231,IN MICHIGAN,"For the lure of far places, and something that tugged"
4232,IN MICHIGAN,"At one's heart because of a June sky,"
4233,IN MICHIGAN,"And stretches of blue water,"
4234,IN MICHIGAN,And a warm wind blowing from the south.
4235,IN MICHIGAN,What could I do but take a boat
4236,IN MICHIGAN,And go to meet you?
4237,IN MICHIGAN,
4238,IN MICHIGAN,"And when to-day is not enough,"
4239,IN MICHIGAN,But you must live to-morrow also;
4240,IN MICHIGAN,And when the present stands in the way
4241,IN MICHIGAN,"Of something to come,"
4242,IN MICHIGAN,"And there is but one you would see,"
4243,IN MICHIGAN,All the interval of waiting is a wall.
4244,IN MICHIGAN,And so it was I walked the landward deck
4245,IN MICHIGAN,With flapping coat and hat pulled down;
4246,IN MICHIGAN,And I sat on the leeward deck and looked
4247,IN MICHIGAN,"At the streaming smoke of the funnels,"
4248,IN MICHIGAN,"And the far waste of rhythmical water,"
4249,IN MICHIGAN,And at the gulls flying by our side.
4250,IN MICHIGAN,
4251,IN MICHIGAN,"There was music on board and dancing,"
4252,IN MICHIGAN,But I could not take part.
4253,IN MICHIGAN,"For above all there was the bluest sky,"
4254,IN MICHIGAN,And around us the urge of magical distances.
4255,IN MICHIGAN,"And just because you were in the violins,"
4256,IN MICHIGAN,"And in everything, and were wholly the world"
4257,IN MICHIGAN,"Of sense and sight,"
4258,IN MICHIGAN,It was too much. One could not live it
4259,IN MICHIGAN,And make it all his own--
4260,IN MICHIGAN,It was too much.
4261,IN MICHIGAN,"And I wondered where the rest could be going,"
4262,IN MICHIGAN,Or what they thought of water and sky
4263,IN MICHIGAN,Without knowing you.
4264,IN MICHIGAN,
4265,IN MICHIGAN,"But at four o'clock there was a rim,"
4266,IN MICHIGAN,A circled edge of rainbow color
4267,IN MICHIGAN,"Which suspired, widened and narrowed under your gaze:"
4268,IN MICHIGAN,"It was the phantasy of straining eyes,"
4269,IN MICHIGAN,Or land--and it was land.
4270,IN MICHIGAN,It was distant trees.
4271,IN MICHIGAN,"And then it was dunes, bluffs of yellow sand."
4272,IN MICHIGAN,We began to wonder how far it was--
4273,IN MICHIGAN,"Five miles, or ten miles--"
4274,IN MICHIGAN,Surely only five miles!--
4275,IN MICHIGAN,But at last whatever it was we swung to the end.
4276,IN MICHIGAN,"We rounded the lighthouse pier,"
4277,IN MICHIGAN,Almost before we knew.
4278,IN MICHIGAN,"We slowed our speed in a dizzy river of black,"
4279,IN MICHIGAN,We drifted softly to dock.
4280,IN MICHIGAN,
4281,IN MICHIGAN,"I took the ferry,"
4282,IN MICHIGAN,"I crossed the river,"
4283,IN MICHIGAN,I ran almost through the little batch
4284,IN MICHIGAN,Of fishermen's shacks.
4285,IN MICHIGAN,"I climbed the winding road of the hill,"
4286,IN MICHIGAN,And dove in a shadowy quiet
4287,IN MICHIGAN,"Of paths of moss and dancing leaves,"
4288,IN MICHIGAN,And straight stretched limbs of giant pines
4289,IN MICHIGAN,On patches of sky.
4290,IN MICHIGAN,I ran to the top of the bluff
4291,IN MICHIGAN,Where the lodge-house stood.
4292,IN MICHIGAN,And there the sunlit lake burst on me
4293,IN MICHIGAN,And wine-like air.
4294,IN MICHIGAN,And below me was the beach
4295,IN MICHIGAN,Where the serried lines of hurrying water
4296,IN MICHIGAN,Came up like rank on rank of men
4297,IN MICHIGAN,And fell with a shout on the rocks!
4298,IN MICHIGAN,"I plunged, I stumbled, I ran"
4299,IN MICHIGAN,"Down the hill,"
4300,IN MICHIGAN,"For I thought I saw you,"
4301,IN MICHIGAN,"And it was you, you were there!"
4302,IN MICHIGAN,"And I shall never forget your cry,"
4303,IN MICHIGAN,"Nor how you raised your arms and cried,"
4304,IN MICHIGAN,And laughed when you saw me.
4305,IN MICHIGAN,And there we were with the lake
4306,IN MICHIGAN,And the sun with his ruddy search-light blaze
4307,IN MICHIGAN,Stretching back to lost Chicago.
4308,IN MICHIGAN,"The sun, the lake, the beach, and ourselves"
4309,IN MICHIGAN,"Were all that was left of Time,"
4310,IN MICHIGAN,All else was lost.
4311,IN MICHIGAN,
4312,IN MICHIGAN,You were making a camp.
4313,IN MICHIGAN,You had bent from the bank a cedar bough
4314,IN MICHIGAN,And tied it down.
4315,IN MICHIGAN,"And over it flung a quilt of many colors,"
4316,IN MICHIGAN,And under it spread on the voluptuous silt
4317,IN MICHIGAN,Gray blankets and canvas pillows.
4318,IN MICHIGAN,I saw it all in a glance.
4319,IN MICHIGAN,And there in dread of eyes we stood
4320,IN MICHIGAN,"Scanning the bluff and the beach,"
4321,IN MICHIGAN,Lest in the briefest touch of lips
4322,IN MICHIGAN,We might be seen.
4323,IN MICHIGAN,
4324,IN MICHIGAN,"For there were eyes, or we thought"
4325,IN MICHIGAN,"There were eyes, on the porch of the lodge,"
4326,IN MICHIGAN,"And eyes along the forest's rim on the hill,"
4327,IN MICHIGAN,And eyes on the shore.
4328,IN MICHIGAN,"But a minute past there was no sun,"
4329,IN MICHIGAN,Only a star that shone like a match which lights
4330,IN MICHIGAN,To a blue intenseness amid the glow of a hearth.
4331,IN MICHIGAN,And we sat on the sand as dusk came down
4332,IN MICHIGAN,In a communion of silence and low words.
4333,IN MICHIGAN,"Till you said at last: ""We'll sup at the lodge,"
4334,IN MICHIGAN,Then say good night to me and leave
4335,IN MICHIGAN,As if to stay overnight in the village.
4336,IN MICHIGAN,But instead make a long detour through the wood
4337,IN MICHIGAN,"And come to the shore through that ravine,"
4338,IN MICHIGAN,"Be here at the tent at midnight."""
4339,IN MICHIGAN,
4340,IN MICHIGAN,And so I did.
4341,IN MICHIGAN,"I stole through echoless ways,"
4342,IN MICHIGAN,Where no twigs broke and where I heard
4343,IN MICHIGAN,My heart beat like a watch under a pillow.
4344,IN MICHIGAN,And the whippoorwills were singing.
4345,IN MICHIGAN,And the sound of the surf below me
4346,IN MICHIGAN,Was the sound of silver-poplar leaves
4347,IN MICHIGAN,In a wind that makes no pause....
4348,IN MICHIGAN,"I hurried down the steep ravine,"
4349,IN MICHIGAN,And a bat flew up at my feet from the brush
4350,IN MICHIGAN,And crossed the moon.
4351,IN MICHIGAN,"To my left was the lighthouse,"
4352,IN MICHIGAN,"And black and deep purples far away,"
4353,IN MICHIGAN,And all was still.
4354,IN MICHIGAN,Till I stood breathless by the tent
4355,IN MICHIGAN,"And heard your whispered welcome,"
4356,IN MICHIGAN,And felt your kiss.
4357,IN MICHIGAN,
4358,IN MICHIGAN,Lovers lay at mid-night
4359,IN MICHIGAN,On roofs of Memphis and Athens
4360,IN MICHIGAN,And looked at tropical stars
4361,IN MICHIGAN,As large as golden beetles.
4362,IN MICHIGAN,"Nothing is new, save this,"
4363,IN MICHIGAN,And this is always new.
4364,IN MICHIGAN,And there in your tent
4365,IN MICHIGAN,With the balm of the mid-night breeze
4366,IN MICHIGAN,"Sweeping over us,"
4367,IN MICHIGAN,We looked at one great star
4368,IN MICHIGAN,"Through a flap of your many-colored tent,"
4369,IN MICHIGAN,And the eternal quality of rapture
4370,IN MICHIGAN,And mystery and vision flowed through us.
4371,IN MICHIGAN,
4372,IN MICHIGAN,"Next day we went to Grand Haven,"
4373,IN MICHIGAN,"For my desire was your desire,"
4374,IN MICHIGAN,Whatever wish one had the other had.
4375,IN MICHIGAN,"And up the Grand River we rowed,"
4376,IN MICHIGAN,"With rushes and lily pads about us,"
4377,IN MICHIGAN,"And the sand hills back of us,"
4378,IN MICHIGAN,"Till we came to a quiet land,"
4379,IN MICHIGAN,A lotus place of farms and meadows.
4380,IN MICHIGAN,"And we tied our boat to Schmitty's dock,"
4381,IN MICHIGAN,Where we had a dinner of fish.
4382,IN MICHIGAN,"And where, after resting, to follow your will"
4383,IN MICHIGAN,We drifted back to Spring Lake--
4384,IN MICHIGAN,"And under a larger moon,"
4385,IN MICHIGAN,"Now almost full,"
4386,IN MICHIGAN,"Walked three miles to The Beeches,"
4387,IN MICHIGAN,"By a winding country road,"
4388,IN MICHIGAN,Where we had supper.
4389,IN MICHIGAN,"And afterwards a long sleep,"
4390,IN MICHIGAN,Waking to the song of robins.
4391,IN MICHIGAN,
4392,IN MICHIGAN,And that day I said:
4393,IN MICHIGAN,"There are wild places, blue water, pine forests,"
4394,IN MICHIGAN,"There are apple orchards, and wonderful roads"
4395,IN MICHIGAN,Around Elk Lake--shall we go?
4396,IN MICHIGAN,"And we went, for your desire was mine."
4397,IN MICHIGAN,"And there we climbed hills,"
4398,IN MICHIGAN,"And ate apples along the shaded ways,"
4399,IN MICHIGAN,And rolled great boulders down the steeps
4400,IN MICHIGAN,To watch them splash in the water.
4401,IN MICHIGAN,And we stood and wondered what was beyond
4402,IN MICHIGAN,The farther shore two miles away.
4403,IN MICHIGAN,And we came to a place on the shore
4404,IN MICHIGAN,"Where four great pine trees stood,"
4405,IN MICHIGAN,And underneath them wild flowers to the edge
4406,IN MICHIGAN,Of sand so soft for naked feet.
4407,IN MICHIGAN,"And here, for not a soul was near,"
4408,IN MICHIGAN,"We stripped and swam far out, laughing, rejoicing,"
4409,IN MICHIGAN,Rolling and diving in those great depths
4410,IN MICHIGAN,Of bracing water under a glittering sun.
4411,IN MICHIGAN,
4412,IN MICHIGAN,There were farm houses enough
4413,IN MICHIGAN,For food and shelter.
4414,IN MICHIGAN,But something urged us on.
4415,IN MICHIGAN,One knows the end and dreads the end
4416,IN MICHIGAN,Yet seeks the end.
4417,IN MICHIGAN,"And you asked, ""Is there a town near?"
4418,IN MICHIGAN,"Let's see a town."""
4419,IN MICHIGAN,So we walked to Traverse City
4420,IN MICHIGAN,Through cut-over land and blasted
4421,IN MICHIGAN,"Trunks and stumps of pine,"
4422,IN MICHIGAN,And by the side of desolate hills.
4423,IN MICHIGAN,But when we got to Traverse City
4424,IN MICHIGAN,"You were not content, nor was I."
4425,IN MICHIGAN,Something urged us on.
4426,IN MICHIGAN,Then you thought of Northport
4427,IN MICHIGAN,"And of its Norse and German fishermen,"
4428,IN MICHIGAN,And its quaint piers where they smoke fish.
4429,IN MICHIGAN,So we drove for thirty miles
4430,IN MICHIGAN,In a speeding automobile
4431,IN MICHIGAN,"Over hills, around sudden curves, into warm coverts,"
4432,IN MICHIGAN,"Or hollows, sometimes at the edge of the Bay,"
4433,IN MICHIGAN,"Again on the hill,"
4434,IN MICHIGAN,From where we could see Old Mission
4435,IN MICHIGAN,"Amid blues and blacks, across a score of miles of the Bay,"
4436,IN MICHIGAN,Waving like watered silk under the moon!
4437,IN MICHIGAN,"And by meadows of clover newly cut,"
4438,IN MICHIGAN,And by peach orchards and vineyards.
4439,IN MICHIGAN,But when we came to the little town
4440,IN MICHIGAN,"Already asleep, though it was but eight o'clock,"
4441,IN MICHIGAN,And only a few drowsy lamps
4442,IN MICHIGAN,"With misty eyelids shone from a store or two,"
4443,IN MICHIGAN,"I said, ""Do you see those twinkling lights?"
4444,IN MICHIGAN,"That's Northport Point, that's the Cedar Cabin--"
4445,IN MICHIGAN,"Let's go to the Cedar Cabin."""
4446,IN MICHIGAN,And so we crossed the Bay
4447,IN MICHIGAN,"Amid great waves in a plunging launch,"
4448,IN MICHIGAN,"And a roaring breeze and a great moon,"
4449,IN MICHIGAN,For now the moon was full.
4450,IN MICHIGAN,
4451,IN MICHIGAN,So here was the Cedar Cabin
4452,IN MICHIGAN,"On a strip of land as wide as a house and lawn,"
4453,IN MICHIGAN,"And on one side Lake Michigan,"
4454,IN MICHIGAN,And on one side the Bay.
4455,IN MICHIGAN,"There were distances of color all around,"
4456,IN MICHIGAN,"And stars and darknesses of land and trees,"
4457,IN MICHIGAN,And at the point the lighthouse.
4458,IN MICHIGAN,"And over us the moon,"
4459,IN MICHIGAN,And over the balcony of our room
4460,IN MICHIGAN,"All of these, where we lay till I slept,"
4461,IN MICHIGAN,"Listening to the water of the lake,"
4462,IN MICHIGAN,And the water of the Bay.
4463,IN MICHIGAN,"And we saw the moon sink like a red bomb,"
4464,IN MICHIGAN,And we saw the stars change
4465,IN MICHIGAN,As the sky wheeled....
4466,IN MICHIGAN,"Now this was the end of the earth,"
4467,IN MICHIGAN,For this strip of land
4468,IN MICHIGAN,Ran out to a point no larger than one of the stumps
4469,IN MICHIGAN,We saw on the desolate hills.
4470,IN MICHIGAN,"And moreover it seemed to dive under,"
4471,IN MICHIGAN,Or waste away in a sudden depth of water.
4472,IN MICHIGAN,"And around it was a swirl,"
4473,IN MICHIGAN,"To the north the bounding waves of the Lake,"
4474,IN MICHIGAN,And to the south the Bay which seemed the Lake.
4475,IN MICHIGAN,"But could we speak of it, even though"
4476,IN MICHIGAN,I saw your eyes when you thought of it?
4477,IN MICHIGAN,A sigh of wind blew through the rustic temple
4478,IN MICHIGAN,"When we saw this symbol together,"
4479,IN MICHIGAN,And neither spoke.
4480,IN MICHIGAN,"But that night, somewhere in the beginning of drowsiness,"
4481,IN MICHIGAN,"You said: ""There is no further place to go,"
4482,IN MICHIGAN,"We must retrace."""
4483,IN MICHIGAN,"And I awoke in a torrent of light in the room,"
4484,IN MICHIGAN,Hearing voices and steps on the walk:
4485,IN MICHIGAN,"I looked for you,"
4486,IN MICHIGAN,But you had arisen.
4487,IN MICHIGAN,"Then I dressed and searched for you,"
4488,IN MICHIGAN,But you were gone.
4489,IN MICHIGAN,Then I stood for long minutes
4490,IN MICHIGAN,Looking at a sail far out at sea
4491,IN MICHIGAN,And departed too.
4492,IN MICHIGAN,
4493,IN MICHIGAN,
4494,IN MICHIGAN,
4495,IN MICHIGAN,
4496,THE STAR,THE STAR
4497,THE STAR,
4498,THE STAR,
4499,THE STAR,I am a certain god
4500,THE STAR,Who slipped down from a remote height
4501,THE STAR,To a place of pools and stars.
4502,THE STAR,And I sat invisible
4503,THE STAR,Amid a clump of trees
4504,THE STAR,To watch the madmen.
4505,THE STAR,
4506,THE STAR,"There were cries and groans about me,"
4507,THE STAR,And shouts of laughter and curses.
4508,THE STAR,"Figures passed by with self-absorbed contempt,"
4509,THE STAR,Wrinkling in bitter smiles about their lips.
4510,THE STAR,Others hurried on with set eyes
4511,THE STAR,Pursuing something.
4512,THE STAR,Then I said this is the place for mad Frederick--
4513,THE STAR,Mad Frederick will be here.
4514,THE STAR,
4515,THE STAR,But everywhere I could see
4516,THE STAR,Figures sitting or standing
4517,THE STAR,By little pools.
4518,THE STAR,Some seemed grown into the soil
4519,THE STAR,And were helpless.
4520,THE STAR,And of these some were asleep.
4521,THE STAR,Others laughed the laughter
4522,THE STAR,That comes from dying men
4523,THE STAR,Trying to face Death.
4524,THE STAR,"And others said ""I should be content,"""
4525,THE STAR,"And others said ""I will fly."""
4526,THE STAR,"Whereupon sepulchral voices muttered,"
4527,THE STAR,As of creatures sitting or hanging head down
4528,THE STAR,"From limbs of the trees,"
4529,THE STAR,"""We will not let you."""
4530,THE STAR,And others looked in their pools
4531,THE STAR,"And clasped hands and said ""Gone, all gone."""
4532,THE STAR,By other pools there were dead bodies:
4533,THE STAR,"Some of youth, some of age."
4534,THE STAR,"They had given up the fight,"
4535,THE STAR,"They had drunk poisoned water,"
4536,THE STAR,They had searched
4537,THE STAR,Until they fell--
4538,THE STAR,All had gone mad!
4539,THE STAR,
4540,THE STAR,"Then I, a certain god,"
4541,THE STAR,Curious to know
4542,THE STAR,What it is in pools and stars
4543,THE STAR,That drives men and women
4544,THE STAR,Over the earth in this quest
4545,THE STAR,Waited for mad Frederick.
4546,THE STAR,And then I heard his step.
4547,THE STAR,
4548,THE STAR,I knew that long ago
4549,THE STAR,He sat by one of these pools
4550,THE STAR,Enraptured of a star's image.
4551,THE STAR,"And that hands, for his own good,"
4552,THE STAR,"As they said,"
4553,THE STAR,Dumped clay into the pool
4554,THE STAR,And blotted his star.
4555,THE STAR,And I knew that after that
4556,THE STAR,"He had said, ""They will never spy again"
4557,THE STAR,Upon my ecstasy.
4558,THE STAR,They will never see me watching one star.
4559,THE STAR,"I will fly by rivers,"
4560,THE STAR,"And by little brooks,"
4561,THE STAR,"And by the edge of lakes,"
4562,THE STAR,"And by little bends of water,"
4563,THE STAR,"Where no wind blows,"
4564,THE STAR,And glance at stars as I pass.
4565,THE STAR,They will never spy again
4566,THE STAR,"Upon my ecstasy."""
4567,THE STAR,
4568,THE STAR,And I knew that mad Frederick
4569,THE STAR,In this flight
4570,THE STAR,Through years of restless and madness
4571,THE STAR,Was caught by the image of a star
4572,THE STAR,In a mere beyond a meadow
4573,THE STAR,"Down from a hill, under a forest,"
4574,THE STAR,"And had said,"
4575,THE STAR,"""No one sees;"
4576,THE STAR,"Here I can find life,"
4577,THE STAR,"Through vision of eternal things."""
4578,THE STAR,But they had followed him.
4579,THE STAR,"They stood on the brow of the hill,"
4580,THE STAR,And when they saw him gazing in the water
4581,THE STAR,"They rolled a great stone down the hill,"
4582,THE STAR,And shattered the star's image.
4583,THE STAR,Then mad Frederick fled with laughter.
4584,THE STAR,It echoed through the wood.
4585,THE STAR,"And he said, ""I will look for moons,"
4586,THE STAR,"I will punish them who disturb me,"
4587,THE STAR,"By worshiping moons."""
4588,THE STAR,But when he sought moons
4589,THE STAR,"They left him alone,"
4590,THE STAR,And he did not want the moons.
4591,THE STAR,"And he was alone, and sick from the moons,"
4592,THE STAR,"And covered as with a white blankness,"
4593,THE STAR,Which was the worst madness of all.
4594,THE STAR,
4595,THE STAR,"And I, a certain god,"
4596,THE STAR,Waiting for mad Frederick
4597,THE STAR,"To enter this place of pools and stars,"
4598,THE STAR,Saw him at last.
4599,THE STAR,With a sigh he looked about upon his fellows
4600,THE STAR,Sitting or standing by their pools.
4601,THE STAR,"And some of the pools were covered with scum,"
4602,THE STAR,"And some were glazed as of filth,"
4603,THE STAR,"And some were grown with weeds,"
4604,THE STAR,"And some were congealed as of the north wind,"
4605,THE STAR,"And a few were yet pure,"
4606,THE STAR,And held the star's image.
4607,THE STAR,"And by these some sat and were glad,"
4608,THE STAR,Others had lost the vision.
4609,THE STAR,"The star was there, but its meaning vanished."
4610,THE STAR,"And mad Frederick, going here and there,"
4611,THE STAR,"With no purpose,"
4612,THE STAR,Only curious and interested
4613,THE STAR,"As I was, a certain god,"
4614,THE STAR,Came by a certain pool
4615,THE STAR,And saw a star.
4616,THE STAR,
4617,THE STAR,"He shivered,"
4618,THE STAR,"He clasped his hands,"
4619,THE STAR,"He sank to his knees,"
4620,THE STAR,He touched his lips to the water.
4621,THE STAR,
4622,THE STAR,Then voices from the limbs of the trees muttered:
4623,THE STAR,"""There he is again."""
4624,THE STAR,"""He must be driven away."""
4625,THE STAR,"""The pool is not his."""
4626,THE STAR,"""He does not belong here."""
4627,THE STAR,So as when bats fly in a cave
4628,THE STAR,They swooped from their hidings in the trees
4629,THE STAR,And dashed themselves in the pool.

4637,THE STAR,"Then a certain god,"
4638,THE STAR,"Of less power than mine,"
4639,THE STAR,Came and sat beside me and said:
4640,THE STAR,"""Why do you allow this to be?"
4641,THE STAR,"They are all seeking,"
4642,THE STAR,Why do you not let them find their heart's delight?
4643,THE STAR,"Why do you allow this to be?"""
4644,THE STAR,But I did not answer.
4645,THE STAR,The lesser god did not know
4646,THE STAR,"That I have no power,"
4647,THE STAR,That only the God has the power.
4648,THE STAR,And that this must be
4649,THE STAR,In spite of all lesser gods.
4650,THE STAR,
4651,THE STAR,And I saw mad Frederick
4652,THE STAR,"Arise and ascend to the top of a high hill,"
4653,THE STAR,And I saw him find the star
4654,THE STAR,Whose image he had seen in the pool.
4655,THE STAR,Then he knelt and prayed:
4656,THE STAR,"""Give me to understand, O Star,"
4657,THE STAR,"Your inner self, your eternal spirit,"
4658,THE STAR,"That I may have you and not images of you,"
4659,THE STAR,"So that I may know what has driven me through the world,"
4660,THE STAR,And may cure my soul.
4661,THE STAR,"For I know you are Eternal Love,"
4662,THE STAR,And I can never escape you.
4663,THE STAR,"And if I cannot escape you,"
4664,THE STAR,Then I must serve you.
4665,THE STAR,"And if I must serve you,"
4666,THE STAR,It must be to good and not ill--
4667,THE STAR,You have brought me from the forest of pools
4668,THE STAR,"And the images of stars,"
4669,THE STAR,Here to the hill's top.
4670,THE STAR,Where now do I go?
4671,THE STAR,"And what shall I do?"""
