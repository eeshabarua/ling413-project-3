24,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
25,PREFACE.,
26,PREFACE.,The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson
27,PREFACE.,"long since called ""the Poetry of the Portfolio,""--something produced"
28,PREFACE.,"absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of"
29,PREFACE.,expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably
30,PREFACE.,forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism
31,PREFACE.,"and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it"
32,PREFACE.,may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the
33,PREFACE.,unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the
34,PREFACE.,"present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she"
35,PREFACE.,"must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,"
36,PREFACE.,literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the
37,PREFACE.,"doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly"
38,PREFACE.,"limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,"
39,PREFACE.,"like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with"
40,PREFACE.,"great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her"
41,PREFACE.,"lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great"
42,PREFACE.,abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all
43,PREFACE.,"conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,"
44,PREFACE.,and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own
45,PREFACE.,tenacious fastidiousness.
46,PREFACE.,
47,PREFACE.,"Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died"
48,PREFACE.,"there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the"
49,PREFACE.,"leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known"
50,PREFACE.,college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large
51,PREFACE.,"reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with"
52,PREFACE.,the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these
53,PREFACE.,occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and
54,PREFACE.,did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from
55,PREFACE.,"her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence."
56,PREFACE.,"The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,"
57,PREFACE.,and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if
58,PREFACE.,"she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded"
59,PREFACE.,"with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and"
60,PREFACE.,brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as
61,PREFACE.,Undine or Mignon or Thekla.
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her
64,PREFACE.,"personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is"
65,PREFACE.,believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a
66,PREFACE.,quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of
67,PREFACE.,"anything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and"
68,PREFACE.,profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting
69,PREFACE.,"an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet"
70,PREFACE.,often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are
71,PREFACE.,"here published as they were written, with very few and superficial"
72,PREFACE.,changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been
73,PREFACE.,"assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these"
74,PREFACE.,"verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with"
75,PREFACE.,"rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and"
76,PREFACE.,"a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the"
77,PREFACE.,"few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at"
78,PREFACE.,the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can
79,PREFACE.,"delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental"
80,PREFACE.,"struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,"
81,PREFACE.,"sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the"
82,PREFACE.,reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these
83,PREFACE.,"poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an"
84,PREFACE.,"uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really"
85,PREFACE.,"unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's"
86,PREFACE.,"breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin"
87,PREFACE.,"wrote in his earlier and better days, ""No weight nor mass nor beauty"
88,PREFACE.,"of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought."""

99,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
100,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these"
101,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"early editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the"
102,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"times. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear"
103,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"as dots, became commas and semi-colons."
104,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
105,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"In the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her"
106,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"handwritten poem which her editors titled ""Renunciation"" is given,"
107,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"and I here transcribe that manuscript as faithfully as I can,"
108,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,showing _underlined_ words thus.
109,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
110,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
111,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,There came a day - at Summer's full -
112,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Entirely for me -
113,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,I thought that such were for the Saints -
114,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Where Resurrections - be -
115,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
116,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The sun - as common - went abroad -
117,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"The flowers - accustomed - blew,"
118,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,As if no soul - that solstice passed -
119,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Which maketh all things - new -
120,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
121,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The time was scarce profaned - by speech -
122,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The falling of a word
123,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Was needless - as at Sacrament -
124,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The _Wardrobe_ - of our Lord!
125,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
126,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Each was to each - the sealed church -
127,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Permitted to commune -  _this_ time -
128,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Lest we too awkward show
129,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"At Supper of ""the Lamb."""
130,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
131,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The hours slid fast - as hours will -
132,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Clutched tight - by greedy hands -
133,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,So - faces on two Decks look back -
134,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Bound to _opposing_ lands.
135,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
136,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"And so, when all the time had leaked,"
137,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"Without external sound,"
138,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Each bound the other's Crucifix -
139,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,We gave no other bond -
140,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
141,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"Sufficient troth - that we shall _rise_,"
142,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Deposed - at length the Grave -
143,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,To that new marriage -
144,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,_Justified_ - through Calvaries - of Love!
145,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
146,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
147,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"From the handwriting, it is not always clear which are dashes,"
148,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"which are commas and which are periods, nor it is entirely"
149,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,clear which initial letters are capitalized.
150,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
151,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"However, this transcription may be compared with the edited"
152,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,version in the main text to get a flavor of the changes made
153,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,in these early editions.

2809,PREFACE,PREFACE
2810,PREFACE,
2811,PREFACE,The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's
2812,PREFACE,poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
2813,PREFACE,artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
2814,PREFACE,qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
2815,PREFACE,"themes,--life and love and death. That ""irresistible needle-touch,"""
2816,PREFACE,"as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very"
2817,PREFACE,"core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as"
2818,PREFACE,it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
2819,PREFACE,"power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to"
2820,PREFACE,"form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties."
2821,PREFACE,
2822,PREFACE,Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending
2823,PREFACE,"occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of"
2824,PREFACE,"her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend ""H.H."""
2825,PREFACE,"must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th"
2826,PREFACE,"September, 1884, she wrote:--"
2827,PREFACE,
2828,PREFACE,
2829,PREFACE,"MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses"
2830,PREFACE,"you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your ""day and"
2831,PREFACE,"generation"" that you will not give them light."
2832,PREFACE,
2833,PREFACE,If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive
2834,PREFACE,"you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee"
2835,PREFACE,and executor. Surely after you are what is called
2836,PREFACE,"""dead"" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you"
2837,PREFACE,have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
2838,PREFACE,"verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think"
2839,PREFACE,we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
2840,PREFACE,a thought any more than a deed which might help a
2841,PREFACE,single soul. . . .

2845,HELEN JACKSON.,HELEN JACKSON.
2846,HELEN JACKSON.,
2847,HELEN JACKSON.,
2848,HELEN JACKSON.,"The ""portfolios"" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,"
2849,HELEN JACKSON.,by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had
2850,HELEN JACKSON.,"been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little"
2851,HELEN JACKSON.,"fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear"
2852,HELEN JACKSON.,"evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had"
2853,HELEN JACKSON.,received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of
2854,HELEN JACKSON.,"rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and"
2855,HELEN JACKSON.,"phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one"
2856,HELEN JACKSON.,"form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without"
2857,HELEN JACKSON.,"important exception, her friends have generously placed at the"
2858,HELEN JACKSON.,disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and
2859,HELEN JACKSON.,these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
2860,HELEN JACKSON.,renderings of the same verse.
2861,HELEN JACKSON.,
2862,HELEN JACKSON.,To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
2863,HELEN JACKSON.,"subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They"
2864,HELEN JACKSON.,should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
2865,HELEN JACKSON.,"suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some"
2866,HELEN JACKSON.,time in the finished picture.
2867,HELEN JACKSON.,
2868,HELEN JACKSON.,Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
2869,HELEN JACKSON.,winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the
2870,HELEN JACKSON.,"April following, she says, ""I made no verse, but one or two, until"
2871,HELEN JACKSON.,"this winter."""
2872,HELEN JACKSON.,
2873,HELEN JACKSON.,"The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running"
2874,HELEN JACKSON.,Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in
2875,HELEN JACKSON.,"breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her"
2876,HELEN JACKSON.,latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
2877,HELEN JACKSON.,"fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,"
2878,HELEN JACKSON.,"everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous"
2879,HELEN JACKSON.,dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of
2880,HELEN JACKSON.,a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
2881,HELEN JACKSON.,strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of
2882,HELEN JACKSON.,"the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,"
2883,HELEN JACKSON.,the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
2884,HELEN JACKSON.,chronologic accuracy.
2885,HELEN JACKSON.,
2886,HELEN JACKSON.,"As a rule, the verses were without titles; but ""A Country Burial,"""
2887,HELEN JACKSON.,"""A Thunder-Storm,"" ""The Humming-Bird,"" and a few others were named"
2888,HELEN JACKSON.,"by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the"
2889,HELEN JACKSON.,"accompanying note, if sent to a friend."
2890,HELEN JACKSON.,
2891,HELEN JACKSON.,"The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in"
2892,HELEN JACKSON.,"pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of"
2893,HELEN JACKSON.,responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not
2894,HELEN JACKSON.,absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her
2895,HELEN JACKSON.,"rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it"
2896,HELEN JACKSON.,seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
2897,HELEN JACKSON.,more usual rhymes.
2898,HELEN JACKSON.,
2899,HELEN JACKSON.,"Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very"
2900,HELEN JACKSON.,absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
2901,HELEN JACKSON.,"Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a"
2902,HELEN JACKSON.,particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
2903,HELEN JACKSON.,virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of
2904,HELEN JACKSON.,"inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and"
2905,HELEN JACKSON.,"the ""thought-rhyme"" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an"
2906,HELEN JACKSON.,unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.
2907,HELEN JACKSON.,
2908,HELEN JACKSON.,Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.
2909,HELEN JACKSON.,"Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the"
2910,HELEN JACKSON.,"sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She"
2911,HELEN JACKSON.,"touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost"
2912,HELEN JACKSON.,"humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is"
2913,HELEN JACKSON.,"never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic"
2914,HELEN JACKSON.,"has said, she may exhibit toward God ""an Emersonian self-possession,"""
2915,HELEN JACKSON.,it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
2916,HELEN JACKSON.,as it is rare.
2917,HELEN JACKSON.,
2918,HELEN JACKSON.,"She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She"
2919,HELEN JACKSON.,"was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no"
2920,HELEN JACKSON.,love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
2921,HELEN JACKSON.,"introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist"
2922,HELEN JACKSON.,in pretence.
2923,HELEN JACKSON.,
2924,HELEN JACKSON.,"Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and"
2925,HELEN JACKSON.,"bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted"
2926,HELEN JACKSON.,"human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the"
2927,HELEN JACKSON.,first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
2928,HELEN JACKSON.,"pope; the first red leaf hurrying through ""the altered air,"" an"
2929,HELEN JACKSON.,epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or
2930,HELEN JACKSON.,"melancholy, she lived in its presence."

6971,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
6972,PREFACE.,
6973,PREFACE.,The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that
6974,PREFACE.,a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
6975,PREFACE.,"literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put"
6976,PREFACE.,forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
6977,PREFACE.,"peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,"
6978,PREFACE.,"--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines."
6979,PREFACE.,
6980,PREFACE.,"Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in"
6981,PREFACE.,"letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her"
6982,PREFACE.,"_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in"
6983,PREFACE.,"this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four"
6984,PREFACE.,"exceptionally strong ones, as ""A Book,"" and ""With Flowers."""
6985,PREFACE.,
6986,PREFACE.,There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
6987,PREFACE.,"spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward"
6988,PREFACE.,"circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;"
6989,PREFACE.,"for example, the verses ""I had a Guinea golden,"" which seem to"
6990,PREFACE.,"have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty"
6991,PREFACE.,reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in
6992,PREFACE.,which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been
6993,PREFACE.,written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the
6994,PREFACE.,present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
6995,PREFACE.,those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.
