38,PREFACE.,
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,That Eve was Adam's second wife was a common Rabbinic
41,PREFACE.,"speculation. Certain commentators on Genesis adopted this view,"
42,PREFACE.,"to account for the double account of the creation of woman, in"
43,PREFACE.,"the sacred text, first in Genesis i. 27, and second in Genesis"
44,PREFACE.,"xi. 18. And they say that Adam's first wife was named Lilith,"
45,PREFACE.,"but she was expelled from Eden, and after her expulsion Eve was"
46,PREFACE.,created. Abraham Ecchelensis gives the following account of
47,PREFACE.,"Lilith and her doings: ""There are some who do not regard"
48,PREFACE.,"spectres as simple devils, but suppose them to be of a mixed"
49,PREFACE.,"nature--part demoniacal, part human, and to have had their"
50,PREFACE.,"origin from Lilith, Adam's first wife, by Eblis, prince of the"
51,PREFACE.,"devils. This fable has been transmitted to the Arabs, from"
52,PREFACE.,"Jewish sources, by some converts of Mohamet from Cabbalism and"
53,PREFACE.,"Rabbinism, who have transferred all the Jewish fooleries to the"
54,PREFACE.,"Arabs. They gave to Adam a wife formed of clay, along with Adam,"
55,PREFACE.,"and called her Lilith, resting on the Scripture: 'Male and"
56,PREFACE.,"female created He them.'""--_Legends of the Patriarchs and"
57,PREFACE.,Prophets.--Baring Gould._
58,PREFACE.,
59,PREFACE.,"Lilith or Lilis.--In the popular belief of the Hebrews, a female"
60,PREFACE.,"spectre in the shape of a finely dressed woman, who lies in wait"
61,PREFACE.,"for, and kills children. The old Rabbins turned Lilith into a"
62,PREFACE.,"wife of Adam, on whom he begat demons and who still has power to"
63,PREFACE.,lie with men and kill children who are not protected by amulets
64,PREFACE.,with which the Jews of a yet later period supply themselves as a
65,PREFACE.,protection against her. Burton in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_
66,PREFACE.,"tells us: ""The Talmudists say that Adam had a wife called Lilis,"
67,PREFACE.,"before he married Eve, and of her he begat nothing but devils."""
68,PREFACE.,"A commentator on Skinner, quoted in the _Encyclopædia"
69,PREFACE.,"Metropolitana_, says that the English word _Lullaby_ is derived"
70,PREFACE.,"from Lilla, abi (begone, Lilith)! In the demonology of the"
71,PREFACE.,"Middle Ages, Lilis was a famous witch, and is introduced as such"
72,PREFACE.,"in the Walpurgis night scene in Goethe's ""Faust.""--_Webster's"
73,PREFACE.,Dictionary._
74,PREFACE.,
75,PREFACE.,Our word _Lullaby_ is derived from two Arabic words which mean
76,PREFACE.,"""Beware of Lilith!""--_Anon._"
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,"Lilith, the supposed wife of Adam, after she married Eblis, is"
79,PREFACE.,said to have ruled over the city of Damascus.--_Legends of the
80,PREFACE.,Patriarchs and Prophets.--Baring Gould._
81,PREFACE.,
82,PREFACE.,"From these few and meagre details of a fabled existence, which are all"
83,PREFACE.,"that the author has been able to collect from any source whatever, has"
84,PREFACE.,sprung the following poem. The poet feels quite justified in dissenting
85,PREFACE.,"from the statements made in the preceding extracts, and has not drawn"
86,PREFACE.,Lilith as there represented--the bloodthirsty sovereign who ruled
87,PREFACE.,"Damascus, the betrayer of men, the murderer of children. The Lilith of"
88,PREFACE.,the poem is transferred to the more beautiful shadow-world. To that
89,PREFACE.,country which is the abode of poets themselves. And about her is wrapt
90,PREFACE.,"the humanizing element still, and everywhere embodied in the sweetest"
91,PREFACE.,word the human tongue can utter--_lullaby_. Some critics declare that
92,PREFACE.,true literary art inculcates a lofty lesson--has a high moral purpose.
93,PREFACE.,"If poets and their work must fall under this rigorous rule, then alas"
94,PREFACE.,"""Lilith"" will knock at the door of public opinion with a trembling hand"
95,PREFACE.,indeed. If the poem have either moral aim or lesson of any kind (which
96,PREFACE.,"observe, gentle critic, it is by no means asserted that it has), it is"
97,PREFACE.,simply to show that the strongest intellectual powers contain no
98,PREFACE.,elements adverse to the highest and purest exercise of the affectional
99,PREFACE.,"nature. That, in its true condition, the noblest, the most cultured"
100,PREFACE.,"intellect, and the loveliest, sublimest moral and emotional qualities,"
101,PREFACE.,together weave the web that clothes the world's great soul with
102,PREFACE.,imperishable beauty. The possessor of highest intellectual capacity will
103,PREFACE.,be also capable of highest developments in the latter qualities. The
104,PREFACE.,woman of true intellect is the woman of truest affection. For the rest
105,PREFACE.,"let Lilith speak, whose life dropped unrecorded from the earliest world."
106,PREFACE.,It is the poet's hope that the chords of the mother-heart universal will
107,PREFACE.,respond to the song of the childless one. That in the survival of that
108,PREFACE.,"one word _lullaby_, may be revivified the pathetic figure of one whose"
109,PREFACE.,"home, whose hope, whose Eden passed to another. Whose name living in the"
110,PREFACE.,"terrors of superstitious peoples, now lingers in Earth's sweetest"
111,PREFACE.,"utterance. That Pagan Lilith, re-baptized in the pure waters of maternal"
112,PREFACE.,"love, shall breathe to heathen and Christian motherhood alike, that most"
113,PREFACE.,sacred love of Earth still throbbing through its tender lullaby.

121,TO VALERIA.,
122,TO VALERIA.,
123,TO VALERIA.,Broideries and ancient stuffs that some queen
124,TO VALERIA.,Wore; nor gems that warriors' hilts encrusted;
125,TO VALERIA.,Nor fresh from heroes' brows the laurels green;
126,TO VALERIA.,Nor bright sheaves by bards of eld entrusted
127,TO VALERIA.,To earth's great granaries--I bring not these.
128,TO VALERIA.,"Only thin, scattered blades from harvests gleaned"
129,TO VALERIA.,"Erewhile I plucked, may happen thee to please."
130,TO VALERIA.,"So poor indeed, those others had demeaned"
131,TO VALERIA.,"Themselves to cull; or from their strong, firm hands"
132,TO VALERIA.,"Down dropped about their feet with careless laugh,"
133,TO VALERIA.,"Too broken for home gathering, these strands,"
134,TO VALERIA.,Or else more useless than the idle chaff.
135,TO VALERIA.,"But I have garnered them.  Yet, lest they seem"
136,TO VALERIA.,"Unworthy, and so shame Love's offering,"
137,TO VALERIA.,Amid the loose-bound sheaf stray flowers gleam.
138,TO VALERIA.,"And fairer seeming make the gift I bring,"
139,TO VALERIA.,"Lilies blood-red, that lit the waving field,"
140,TO VALERIA.,And now are knotted through the golden grain.
141,TO VALERIA.,"Thou wilt not scorn the tribute I now yield,"
142,TO VALERIA.,Nor even deem the foolish flowers vain.
143,TO VALERIA.,"So take it, and if still too slight, too small"
144,TO VALERIA.,"It seem, think 'tis a bloom that grew anear,"
145,TO VALERIA.,"In other Springtime, the old garden wall."
146,TO VALERIA.,"(That pale blue flower you will remember, dear."
147,TO VALERIA.,"The heedless world, unseeing, passed it by,"
148,TO VALERIA.,"And left it to the bee and you.) Then say,"
149,TO VALERIA.,"""Because the hands that tended it are nigh"
150,TO VALERIA.,"No more, and little feet are gone away"
151,TO VALERIA.,"That round it trampled down the beaded grass,"
152,TO VALERIA.,Sweeter to me it is than musky spray
153,TO VALERIA.,Of Southland; and dearer than days that pass
154,TO VALERIA.,"In other summer-tides."" This simple song"
155,TO VALERIA.,"Read so, dear heart; Nay, rather white-souled one,"
156,TO VALERIA.,"Think 'tis an olden echo, wandered long"
157,TO VALERIA.,From a low bed where 'neath the westering sun
158,TO VALERIA.,You sang. And if your lone heart ever said
159,TO VALERIA.,"""Lo, she is gone, and cannot more be mine,"""
160,TO VALERIA.,"Say now, ""She is not changed--she is not wed,--"
161,TO VALERIA.,She never left her cradle bed. Still shine
162,TO VALERIA.,"The pillows with the print of her wee head."""
163,TO VALERIA.,"So, mother-heart, this song, where through still rings"
164,TO VALERIA.,"The strain you sang above my baby bed,"
165,TO VALERIA.,"I bring. An idle gift mayhap, that clings"
166,TO VALERIA.,"About old days forgotten long, and dead."
167,TO VALERIA.,"This loitering tale, Valeria, take."
168,TO VALERIA.,"Perchance 'tis sad, and hath not any mirth,"
169,TO VALERIA.,"Yet love thou it, for the weak singer's sake,"
170,TO VALERIA.,"And hold it dear, though yet is little worth,"
171,TO VALERIA.,"This tale of Elder-world: of earth's first prime,"
172,TO VALERIA.,"Of years that in their grave so long have lain,"
173,TO VALERIA.,"To-day's dull ear, through poets' tuneful rhyme"
174,TO VALERIA.,"No echo hears, nor mocking friar's strain."

184,BOOK I.,
185,BOOK I.,
186,BOOK I.,Pure as an angel's dream shone Paradise.
187,BOOK I.,Blue mountains hemmed it round; and airy sighs
188,BOOK I.,"Of rippling waters haunted it. Dim glades,"
189,BOOK I.,"And wayward paths o'erflecked with shimmering shades,"
190,BOOK I.,"And tangled dells, and wilding pleasances,"
191,BOOK I.,Hung moist with odors strange from scented trees.
192,BOOK I.,"Sweet sounds o'erbrimmed the place; and rare perfumes,"
193,BOOK I.,"Faint as far sunshine, fell 'mong verdant glooms."
194,BOOK I.,"In that fair land, all hues, all leafage green"
195,BOOK I.,Wrapt flawless days in endless summer-sheen.
196,BOOK I.,"Bright eyes, the violet waking, lifted up"
197,BOOK I.,"Where bent the lily her deep, fragrant cup;"
198,BOOK I.,"And folded buds, 'gainst many a leafy spray--"
199,BOOK I.,The wild-woods' voiceless nuns--knelt down to pray.
200,BOOK I.,"There roses, deep in greenest mosses swathed,"
201,BOOK I.,"Kept happy tryst with tropic blooms, sun-bathed."
202,BOOK I.,No sounds of sadness surged through listening trees:
203,BOOK I.,The waters babbled low; the errant bees
204,BOOK I.,"Made answer, murmurous; nor paled the hue"
205,BOOK I.,The jonquils wore; nor chill the wild breath grew
206,BOOK I.,Of daisies clustered white in dewy croft;
207,BOOK I.,Nor fell the tasseled plumes as satin soft
208,BOOK I.,Upon the broad-leaved corn. Sweet all the day
209,BOOK I.,O'erflowed with music every woodland way;
210,BOOK I.,"And sweet the jargonings of nested bird,"
211,BOOK I.,When light the listless wind the forest stirred.
212,BOOK I.,Straight as the shaft that 'gainst the morning sun
213,BOOK I.,"The slender palm uprears, the Fairest one--"
214,BOOK I.,"The first of womankind--sweet Lilith--stood,"
215,BOOK I.,A gracious shape that glorified the wood.
216,BOOK I.,"About her rounded shoulders warm and bare,"
217,BOOK I.,Like netted sunshine fell her lustrous hair;
218,BOOK I.,The rosy flush of young pomegranate bells
219,BOOK I.,Dawned on her cheeks; and blue as in lone dells
220,BOOK I.,"Sleep the Forget-me-nots, her eyes. With bent"
221,BOOK I.,"Brows, sullen-creased, swart Adam gazed intent"
222,BOOK I.,"Upon a leopard, crouched low in its place"
223,BOOK I.,Beneath his feet. Not once in Lilith's face
224,BOOK I.,"He looked, nor sought her wistful, downcast eyes"
225,BOOK I.,"With shifting shadows dusk, and strange surprise."
226,BOOK I.,"""O, Love,"" she said, ""no more let us contend!"
227,BOOK I.,"So sweet is life, anger, methinks, should end."
228,BOOK I.,"In this, our garden bright, why dost thou claim"
229,BOOK I.,"Ever the highest place, the noblest name?"
230,BOOK I.,Freely to both our Lord gave self-same sway
231,BOOK I.,"O'er living things. Love, thou art gone astray!"
232,BOOK I.,"Twin-born, of equal stature, kindred soul"
233,BOOK I.,Are we; like dowed with strength. Yon stars that roll
234,BOOK I.,"Their course above, down-looking on my face,"
235,BOOK I.,See yours as fair; in neither aught that's base.
236,BOOK I.,"Thy wife, not handmaid I, yet thou dost say,"
237,BOOK I.,"'I first in Eden rule.' Thou, then, hast sway."
238,BOOK I.,"Must I, my Adam, mutely follow thee?"
239,BOOK I.,"Run at thy bidding, crouch beside thy knee?"
240,BOOK I.,Lift up (when thou dost bid me) timid eyes?
241,BOOK I.,"Not so will Lilith dwell in Paradise."""
242,BOOK I.,"""Mine own,"" Adam made answer soft, ""'twere best"
243,BOOK I.,Thou didst forget such ills in noontide rest.
244,BOOK I.,"Content I wake, the keeper of the place."
245,BOOK I.,Of equal stature? Yea! Of self-same grace?
246,BOOK I.,"Nay, Love; recall those lately vanished eves,"
247,BOOK I.,When we together plucked the plantain leaves;
248,BOOK I.,Yon leopard lowly stretched at my command
249,BOOK I.,Its lazy length beneath my soothing hand.
250,BOOK I.,"At thee she snarled, disdaining half, to sheathe"
251,BOOK I.,'Neath thy soft pleading eyes her milk-white teeth.
252,BOOK I.,"Oft, Love, in other times, in sheltered nook,"
253,BOOK I.,We scattered pearly millet by the brook.
254,BOOK I.,Lo thine lay barren in the sand. Quick mine
255,BOOK I.,Upspringing sifts o'er pale blooms odors fine:
256,BOOK I.,Hateful thy chidings grow; each breeze doth bring
257,BOOK I.,Ever thy plaints--thy fretful murmuring.
258,BOOK I.,These many days I weary of thy sighs;
259,BOOK I.,"Know, Lilith, I alone rule Paradise."""
260,BOOK I.,"Thereat he rose, and quick at every stride"
261,BOOK I.,The fawning leopard gambolled at his side.
262,BOOK I.,So fell the first dark shadow of Earth's strife.
263,BOOK I.,With coming evil all the winds were rife.
264,BOOK I.,Lone lay the land with sense of dull loss paled.
265,BOOK I.,The days grew sick at heart; the sunshine failed;
266,BOOK I.,And falling waters breathed in silvery moan
267,BOOK I.,A hidden ail to starlit dells alone--
268,BOOK I.,"As sometimes you have seen, 'neath household eaves,"
269,BOOK I.,"'Mong scents of Springtime, in the budded leaves,"
270,BOOK I.,"The swallows circling blithe, with slant brown wing,"
271,BOOK I.,"Home-flying fleet, with tender chattering,"
272,BOOK I.,And all the place o'errun with nested love--
273,BOOK I.,"So have you come, when leaves hung crisp above"
274,BOOK I.,"The silent door. Yet not again, I ween,"
275,BOOK I.,"Those shining wings, cleaving the air, have seen"
276,BOOK I.,Nor heard the gladsome swallows twittering there--
277,BOOK I.,"Only the empty nests, low-hung and bare,"
278,BOOK I.,Spake of the scattered brood.--So lonely were
279,BOOK I.,To Lilith grown her once loved haunts. Nor fair
280,BOOK I.,"The starlit nights, slow-dropping fragrant dew,"
281,BOOK I.,Nor the dim groves when dawn came shifting through.
282,BOOK I.,"Far 'mong the hills the wood-doves' moan she heard,"
283,BOOK I.,"Or in some nearer copse, a startled bird;"
284,BOOK I.,Or the white moonshine 'mong green boughs o'erhead
285,BOOK I.,"Wrought her full heart to tears. ""Sweet peace,"" she said,"
286,BOOK I.,"""Alas--lies slain!"""
287,BOOK I.,"With musing worn, she brake"
288,BOOK I.,"At last her silence, and to Adam spake:"
289,BOOK I.,"""Beyond these walls I know not what may be--"
290,BOOK I.,"Islands low-fringed, or bare; or tranquil sea,"
291,BOOK I.,"Spaces unpeopled, wastes of burning sands,"
292,BOOK I.,"Green-wooded belts, enclasping summer lands,"
293,BOOK I.,"Or realms of dusky pines, or wolds of snow,"
294,BOOK I.,"Or jagged ice-peaks wrapt in purple glow,"
295,BOOK I.,Or shadowy oceans lapped in fadeless sheen--
296,BOOK I.,"Yet there were Paradise, were Lilith queen."
297,BOOK I.,To dally with my lord I was not meant;
298,BOOK I.,"To soothe his idle whims, above him bent,"
299,BOOK I.,"Warm in my milk-white arms, lull his repose,"
300,BOOK I.,Nor deep in subtle kisses drown his woes.
301,BOOK I.,"Wherefore, since here no more dwells love, I fly"
302,BOOK I.,To seek my home in other lands. For why
303,BOOK I.,Should Lilith wait since Adam's empty state
304,BOOK I.,"More dear he holds than Lilith desolate?"""
305,BOOK I.,"But answer soft made Adam at the word,"
306,BOOK I.,"For faint his dying love, yet coldly stirred"
307,BOOK I.,"Its ashen cerements: ""Nay, love, our home"
308,BOOK I.,Within these garden walls lies safe. Wouldst roam
309,BOOK I.,"Without? Sweet peace, by loss, wilt thou restore"
310,BOOK I.,"One little loss, or miss it evermore?"""
311,BOOK I.,"""In goodly Eden, Adam, safely bide,"
312,BOOK I.,"But I, for peace, nor love, nor life,"" she cried,"
313,BOOK I.,"""Submit to thee. Unto our Lord I own"
314,BOOK I.,Allegiance true; my homage his alone.
315,BOOK I.,"Oft have I watched the mists athwart yon peaks,"
316,BOOK I.,"Pursuing oft past coves and winding creeks,"
317,BOOK I.,"Have thought to touch their shining veil outspread,"
318,BOOK I.,"In happy days ere Love, alas, was dead;"
319,BOOK I.,"So now, farewell! Ere the new day shall break"
320,BOOK I.,"Adown their gleaming track, my way I take."""
321,BOOK I.,She turned; but ere the gate that looked without
322,BOOK I.,"She reached, one fleeting moment paused in doubt"
323,BOOK I.,Upon a river's brink. In one swift glance
324,BOOK I.,All coming time she saw. A weird romance
325,BOOK I.,"Wherein she traced great peoples yet unborn,"
326,BOOK I.,"New springing cycles, strange lands cleft with tarn"
327,BOOK I.,"Or pleasant vale, and green plains stretching far,"
328,BOOK I.,"And quiet bays, and many a shingly bar,"
329,BOOK I.,"And troubled seas, with bitter perils past,"
330,BOOK I.,And elfin shapes that jeering flitted fast
331,BOOK I.,"With scornful faces, leering lips that smiled,"
332,BOOK I.,Or bursts of laughter through that vision wild.
333,BOOK I.,"Uncertain, then, she stood, half loth to turn."
334,BOOK I.,"""Against yon deepening sky, how dimly burn"
335,BOOK I.,"The stars, new-lit. Dear home, thou art so fair!"""
336,BOOK I.,She fondly sighed.
337,BOOK I.,Then sudden she was 'ware
338,BOOK I.,"The angel near her paused, whose watchful care"
339,BOOK I.,"Guards Eden's peaceful bounds. Serene, his air"
340,BOOK I.,"So tender-sweet, so pure the gentle face,"
341,BOOK I.,She scarce dared look upon its subtle grace.
342,BOOK I.,"Sad were his eyes; his words, rebuking, fell"
343,BOOK I.,"Soft as the moonshine clear, in sleeping dell."
344,BOOK I.,"""My sister, go not hence, lest these gates bar"
345,BOOK I.,"Lilith forever out. From peace afar,"
346,BOOK I.,Anger and pride shall lead through distant ways
347,BOOK I.,"Thy feet reluctant, in the evil days."
348,BOOK I.,All is decreed. At yonder southern gate
349,BOOK I.,Behold! waits even now my princely mate.
350,BOOK I.,Thou can'st not tell which hath in our far land
351,BOOK I.,"The highest place. Nay; nor, indeed, whose hand"
352,BOOK I.,Hath grasped the noblest fame; nor yet divine
353,BOOK I.,"Whose brows enwound with honor, brightest shine."
354,BOOK I.,In pleasant labor lurks no thought of pain;
355,BOOK I.,The greatest loss oft brings the noblest gain;
356,BOOK I.,"The heart's warm pulse feels not one throb of strife,"
357,BOOK I.,And Love is holiest crown of human life.
358,BOOK I.,"Ere thou didst sleep, beyond the rim of night"
359,BOOK I.,"I heard a voice that sang. The carol light,"
360,BOOK I.,"Scarce earth-born seemed.  So sweet the matchless strain,"
361,BOOK I.,"Its cadence weird, lowly to breathe again,"
362,BOOK I.,"Wrapt echo, listening, half forgot; and o'er"
363,BOOK I.,"And o'er, as joyous birds unprisoned soar,"
364,BOOK I.,"The free notes rose. And in the silence wide,"
365,BOOK I.,"Across the seas, across the night, I cried:"
366,BOOK I.,"O sinless soul, whose clear voice blithely rings"
367,BOOK I.,'Gainst the blue verge of stars! 'Tis Lilith sings
368,BOOK I.,The happy song of love. O Love! the tint
369,BOOK I.,Of light divine thou wearest. Thou hast no hint
370,BOOK I.,"Of storm or turmoil, or of Sin's rough ways,"
371,BOOK I.,"Whose feet to heaven climb, through darkest maze."
372,BOOK I.,"Ah, Lilith, sure the love that basely weighs,"
373,BOOK I.,"That stoops to count its gifts, and hoarding, says,"
374,BOOK I.,"'Such and so many, these indeed are mine;"
375,BOOK I.,"I hold my treasure dear, nor covet thine;'"
376,BOOK I.,"This is not love; 'tis Thrift in borrowed dress,"
377,BOOK I.,Deceiving thee. Love giveth free largess
378,BOOK I.,"With open hand, clean as the whitest day;"
379,BOOK I.,"Yea, that it gave, forgetteth it straightway."
380,BOOK I.,Beyond these walls dwells bliss that lives not here?
381,BOOK I.,"When thou hast bartered peace, outshining clear"
382,BOOK I.,"And storm-tossed wide, art wildly driven hence,"
383,BOOK I.,The outer world gives thee no recompense.
384,BOOK I.,Each shining sphere that trembles in blue space
385,BOOK I.,Hath orbit true--its own familiar place.
386,BOOK I.,Nor doth the planet pale that gems the night
387,BOOK I.,"Reel wanton down, the smallest star to smite."
388,BOOK I.,"No twining vine, tendril, or springing shoot"
389,BOOK I.,Ere taught thee so; for bud and leaf and root
390,BOOK I.,"Doth its best self lift upward into light,"
391,BOOK I.,"Yet climbing still, scorns not the sacred right"
392,BOOK I.,That shrines its fellow.
393,BOOK I.,"""So pattering rains"
394,BOOK I.,The dark roots drink--and healthful juice slow drains
395,BOOK I.,Deep 'neath the mould; and with their secret toil
396,BOOK I.,"Bear stainless, leaf and flow'r above the soil."
397,BOOK I.,Noblest the soul that self hath most forgot;
398,BOOK I.,Strongest the self which hath most humbly wrought;
399,BOOK I.,"Purest the soul that in full light serene,"
400,BOOK I.,"Unquestioning, enwrapt, God's field doth glean."
401,BOOK I.,I have seen worlds far hence; thy tender feet
402,BOOK I.,"Bleeding, will tread their stony ways. And sweet"
403,BOOK I.,"Is love. And wedded love, grown cold and rude,"
404,BOOK I.,More bitter-seeming makes dull solitude.
405,BOOK I.,Security is sweet; and light and warm
406,BOOK I.,"The young heart beats, close shut from every harm."""
407,BOOK I.,"""Yet,"" Lilith answered slow, ""in that still night"
408,BOOK I.,"Ere He, the garden's Lord, passed from our sight,"
409,BOOK I.,Hast thou forgot his words? 'Lo this fair spot
410,BOOK I.,"Made for your pleasance; see ye mar it not,"
411,BOOK I.,"Oh, twin-born pair! So richly dight with grace"
412,BOOK I.,Of soul and stature; unto whom the place
413,BOOK I.,I give. Together rule. Bear equal sway
414,BOOK I.,O'er all that live herein.'  Hath Lilith sought
415,BOOK I.,A solitary reign? Hath she in aught
416,BOOK I.,Offended? Nay; 'tis Adam who doth break
417,BOOK I.,"The compact. Therefore, unhindered let me take"
418,BOOK I.,My way far hence. I shall not vex his soul
419,BOOK I.,"With fretful plaints, where unknown stars shall roll,"
420,BOOK I.,"Far, far away,"" she sighed."
421,BOOK I.,"""Yet ere these bounds"
422,BOOK I.,"Thy feet pass, linger. Lilith, list glad sounds"
423,BOOK I.,That greet thine ear. Slow cycles will pass on
424,BOOK I.,"And in the time-to-be-bright years, grow wan;"
425,BOOK I.,"Old planets fade, new stars shall dimly burn,"
426,BOOK I.,But not to Eden's peace shalt thou return.
427,BOOK I.,Oft from thy yearning heart glad hope shall fail.
428,BOOK I.,Thy fruit of life lift bloom all sere and pale.
429,BOOK I.,"Certain, small comfort bides, when joy is gone,"
430,BOOK I.,In Great or Less. Grim Sorrow waits to lead thee on.
431,BOOK I.,Sorrow! Thou hast not seen her pallid face.
432,BOOK I.,"In thy most troubled dream she had no place""--"
433,BOOK I.,"""Nay, I depart,"" she said, with lips grown chill."
434,BOOK I.,"""Fearless and free, exiled, but princess still."""
435,BOOK I.,"""I may not hinder thee,"" the Angel sighed;"
436,BOOK I.,"""No soul unwilling here may ever bide."""
437,BOOK I.,Slow swung the verdant gates neath saddest eyes.
438,BOOK I.,_Lilith forever lost fair Paradise._

442,BOOK I.,
443,BOOK II.,BOOK II.
444,BOOK II.,
445,BOOK II.,
446,BOOK II.,"Soft stealing through the shade, and skirting swift"
447,BOOK II.,"The walls of Paradise, through night's dark rift"
448,BOOK II.,Lilith fled far; nor stopped lest deadly snare
449,BOOK II.,Or peril by the wayside lurked.
450,BOOK II.,The air
451,BOOK II.,"Grew chill. Loud beat her heart, as through the wind"
452,BOOK II.,"Echoed, unseen, pursuing feet, behind."
453,BOOK II.,
454,BOOK II.,"Adown the pathway of the mist she passed,"
455,BOOK II.,"And reached a weird, strange land at last."
456,BOOK II.,"When morning flecked the dappled sky with red,"
457,BOOK II.,"And odors sweet from waking flowers were shed,"
458,BOOK II.,"Lilith beheld a plain, outstretching wide,"
459,BOOK II.,With distant mountains seamed.
460,BOOK II.,"Afar, a silvery tide"
461,BOOK II.,The blue shore kissed.  And in that tropic glow
462,BOOK II.,"Dim islands shone, palm-fringed, and low."
463,BOOK II.,"In nearer space, like scarlet arrows flew"
464,BOOK II.,"Strange birds, or 'mong the reedy fens, or through"
465,BOOK II.,"Tall trees, of unknown leafage, glancing, went."
466,BOOK II.,"Now Lilith seaward passed, and stooping, bent"
467,BOOK II.,"Her hollowed hand above the wave, and quaffed;"
468,BOOK II.,For she was spent with wanderings wide.  Loud laughed
469,BOOK II.,"She then, beholding on that silent shore"
470,BOOK II.,"Rare shells, that still faint in their pink lips bore"
471,BOOK II.,"Wild ocean-songs; and precious stones, that bright"
472,BOOK II.,"That dim sea's marge, deep in the land of night"
473,BOOK II.,Thick strewed.
474,BOOK II.,"Then glad, she lifted shining eyes,"
475,BOOK II.,"Loud crying there, ""O Lilith, now arise,"
476,BOOK II.,Great queen-triumphant! See how wildly fair
477,BOOK II.,Before me lies my realm! And from its air
478,BOOK II.,"Soft, sensuous, new life as ruddy wine,"
479,BOOK II.,My spirit drinks. Nor beauty so divine
480,BOOK II.,"Hath Eden's self. Look, where upon the sands"
481,BOOK II.,"The garish mosses spread with dainty hands,"
482,BOOK II.,"Like goblin network fine, each fairy frond."
483,BOOK II.,"And dusky trees shut in broad fields beyond,"
484,BOOK II.,"And hang long trembling garlands, age-grown-gray,"
485,BOOK II.,"From topmost boughs adown, athwart the day;"
486,BOOK II.,"And sweet amid these wilds, bright dewy bells"
487,BOOK II.,"Ring summer chimes.  And soft in fragrant dells,"
488,BOOK II.,"'Mong tender leaves, great spikes of scarlet flaunt"
489,BOOK II.,About the pools--the errant wild bees' haunt--
490,BOOK II.,"And thick with bramble-blooms pink petals starred,"
491,BOOK II.,"And dew-stained buds of blue, the velvet sward."
492,BOOK II.,Scarce ripple stirred the sea; and inland wend
493,BOOK II.,Far bays and sedgy ponds; and rolling rivers bend.
494,BOOK II.,A land of leaf and fruitage in the glow
495,BOOK II.,Of palest glamours steeped. And far and low
496,BOOK II.,Great purple isles; and further still a rim
497,BOOK II.,"Of sunset-tinted hills, that softly dim"
498,BOOK II.,"Shine 'gainst the day. ""O world, new found,"" she said,"
499,BOOK II.,"""With treasures heaped and odors rare, 'mong flowers shed,"
500,BOOK II.,"For whose dear sake I came o'er flinty ways,"
501,BOOK II.,"And paths with danger fraught; 'mong brambly sprays,"
502,BOOK II.,"With bleeding feet, and shoulders thorn-pierced deep."
503,BOOK II.,"But perils past, fade fast. And I will weep"
504,BOOK II.,"My Eden lost no more."" And sweet and low"
505,BOOK II.,"As one who dreams, she said, ""For now I know"
506,BOOK II.,"These mountain heights, these level plains, are mine."""
507,BOOK II.,"She ceased, and inland quickly turned. ""Fair shine"
508,BOOK II.,"Strange fruits thick-set, or blossoms lightly tossed"
509,BOOK II.,"Low at my feet."" Therewith, a dusk globe, crossed"
510,BOOK II.,"With golden bands, from bent boughs, stripped she. Through"
511,BOOK II.,"The gleaming sphere its nectrous juices drew,"
512,BOOK II.,"And thirsting cried--as one grown drunken: ""Mine"
513,BOOK II.,"These fruits unknown, in thorny combs that shine,"
514,BOOK II.,"Or gray-green spikes that glow, dull on the sands."
515,BOOK II.,"Fain would I pluck, out-reaching eager hands,"
516,BOOK II.,Save that a marvel grows of ruddier rind
517,BOOK II.,"Out-flinging fruity breath upon the wind,"
518,BOOK II.,Beneath harsh spines half-hid. Nor drains
519,BOOK II.,My wilful spouse such nectars fine. Nor gains
520,BOOK II.,"His patient care the fruitage rare, these plains"
521,BOOK II.,"That heaps unheeded. Nay, nor bearded grains"
522,BOOK II.,"Golding this goodly land, where Lilith reigns."""
523,BOOK II.,
524,BOOK II.,"So passed the glad years on, and o'er her home--"
525,BOOK II.,"Its woods and mountains, its clear streams--to roam,"
526,BOOK II.,She loved. The inmost throb of Nature's heart
527,BOOK II.,She felt amid the grass. Each daintiest part
528,BOOK II.,"Of Nature's work she knew; each gain, each loss."
529,BOOK II.,And reverent watched on high the starry cross
530,BOOK II.,"Gleaming, mute symbol in that southern dome"
531,BOOK II.,Of One--the Promised One--of days to come.
532,BOOK II.,
533,BOOK II.,The rifted sea-shell on the shingly beach
534,BOOK II.,"She scanned, pitying each inmate gone. Each"
535,BOOK II.,"Named. 'Mong beetling crags, the sea-bird's home,"
536,BOOK II.,"Light-footed, went. Or, idly, in the foam"
537,BOOK II.,"Under the cocoa-palms, her fingers dipped,"
538,BOOK II.,Much marveling to see where featly slipped
539,BOOK II.,"Beneath the waves scaled creatures, crimson-dyed"
540,BOOK II.,"Or luminous: Barred-yellow, purple pied,"
541,BOOK II.,"Rose-tinted, opaline, or dight with stain,"
542,BOOK II.,"Rich as the rainbow streaks, when through the rain"
543,BOOK II.,The Sun's kiss falls. Much wondered she when bright
544,BOOK II.,"By sedgy pools, flamingoes stalked. And light"
545,BOOK II.,The startled ostrich bent his headlong flight
546,BOOK II.,O'er desert bare. And on the woody height
547,BOOK II.,"Trooped zebras, velvet-brown.  The date's green crest"
548,BOOK II.,"Beneath, the peaceful camels lay at rest."
549,BOOK II.,And slender-straight camelopards the boughs
550,BOOK II.,"Down-drew, the lush-green leaves thereon to browse."
551,BOOK II.,"Or oft 'mong oozy bogs, or through the fens,"
552,BOOK II.,"Fearless she went, when low, 'mong reedy dens"
553,BOOK II.,"The water-courses by, huge creatures slept,"
554,BOOK II.,"Or in the jungles spotted panthers crept,"
555,BOOK II.,And in the thickets deadly serpents wound
556,BOOK II.,"Like blossomed wreaths, their coils upon the ground."
557,BOOK II.,All forms of life she saw; with tenderest care
558,BOOK II.,"Uplifting humblest sprays, or blooms most rare."
559,BOOK II.,"Pierced the deep heart of Nature's subtlest lore,"
560,BOOK II.,"Touched highest knowledge, probed the inmost core"
561,BOOK II.,Of hidden things. She tracked each circling world
562,BOOK II.,And the wide sweep of billows lightly curled.
563,BOOK II.,"Each page the Master writ she read, close furled"
564,BOOK II.,"In lotus blooms, or, 'mong the storm-clouds whirled;"
565,BOOK II.,"Or traced, star-lettered, on the flaming scroll"
566,BOOK II.,The night unwinds toward the southern pole.
567,BOOK II.,"And sometimes wiling idle days, she wove"
568,BOOK II.,"In quaint device, gems from her treasure-trove,"
569,BOOK II.,"Rare garlanded, or set in flashing zone"
570,BOOK II.,"Soft emerald, sapphire pale, and many a stone"
571,BOOK II.,Out-gleaming amethyst. Her yellow hair
572,BOOK II.,"Among, the glinting diamonds shone. And there"
573,BOOK II.,"The sultry topaz burned. And laughing, twined"
574,BOOK II.,She round her bare white throat red rubies shrined
575,BOOK II.,In pearls.
576,BOOK II.,Or she among the haunts would rove
577,BOOK II.,"That sheltered island birds; or in the grove,"
578,BOOK II.,"Or 'mong the rocky cliffs, where dainty nests"
579,BOOK II.,"They fashioned swift. She scaled the seaward crests,"
580,BOOK II.,"And on the sands piled turtle eggs, when all"
581,BOOK II.,"About hoarse-shrieked the water-fowl, or call"
582,BOOK II.,"Of plovers fell among the tangled glens,"
583,BOOK II.,Or lonely bitterns' boom came o'er the fens.
584,BOOK II.,"So traversed she her realm, when mangoes green"
585,BOOK II.,"Baobabs by, showed freshest hues; and sheen"
586,BOOK II.,Of silver touched acacias slight; and lone
587,BOOK II.,"The solitary aloes, dreamed. The moan"
588,BOOK II.,Of that far sea against the shore brake soft.
589,BOOK II.,And through that blossom-burdened land as oft
590,BOOK II.,"She roamed and far, sweet sped the passing days."
591,BOOK II.,"Till one dawned fairest, in whose noon-tide haze"
592,BOOK II.,"Sweet slumbering she lay; and dreamed-steeped still,"
593,BOOK II.,"Half conscious, caught the tinkle of a rill"
594,BOOK II.,In far-off Paradise. More silver clear
595,BOOK II.,"Across her thoughts, as once she loved to hear,"
596,BOOK II.,"Rippled the waters, low against the stones"
597,BOOK II.,Where poised gemmed dragon-flies;  and sudden moans
598,BOOK II.,"Shook 'mong blue flags. Waked, vague unrest"
599,BOOK II.,"And tender yearning rose within her breast,"
600,BOOK II.,"And longing love, that she ne'er more might still."
601,BOOK II.,"When late upon her parting day smiled chill,"
602,BOOK II.,"Pensive she gazed upon the darkling land,"
603,BOOK II.,"With lingering feet o'er-passed the shining strand,"
604,BOOK II.,"And silent sat on an o'erhanging ledge,"
605,BOOK II.,The sea o'erlooking. Far the horizon's edge
606,BOOK II.,"Athwart her gaze a rim of blue hills cleft,"
607,BOOK II.,"Whereat she sighed. ""So rose, ere I them left,"
608,BOOK II.,"So smiled, the dim hills round my Eden home."
609,BOOK II.,"But I--wherefore recall, when far I roam,"
610,BOOK II.,Dreams vanished--gone? And now since long time dead
611,BOOK II.,"Is that fair past, I fain would lay it low"
612,BOOK II.,Where soft about it memories sweet may blow
613,BOOK II.,"As summer winds the fallen leaves among."""
614,BOOK II.,"Then passed her tender thoughts, and loud and glad"
615,BOOK II.,"As our morn wakens, strong that yesternight slept sad,"
616,BOOK II.,"She sang. The song triumphant upward swelled,"
617,BOOK II.,Unsorrowed by soft dreams or thoughts of eld--
618,BOOK II.,"As fresh the full, free, mellow notes did rise"
619,BOOK II.,"As the blithe skylark's strain, anear the skies:"
620,BOOK II.,
621,BOOK II.,"High, high, bold Eagle, soar;"
622,BOOK II.,"I watch thy flight, above thy craggèd rock."
623,BOOK II.,"Below thee, torrents roar,"
624,BOOK II.,Down-bursting wild with angry shock
625,BOOK II.,"Upon the vales. O proud bird, free,"
626,BOOK II.,"My spirit, mounting, follows thee,"
627,BOOK II.,"Still follows thee, still follows thee."
628,BOOK II.,
629,BOOK II.,O Sea--O Sea so wide!
630,BOOK II.,Far roll thy waves ere yet they find thy shore.
631,BOOK II.,I hear thy sullen tide
632,BOOK II.,Break 'neath the beetling cliffs with muffled roar.
633,BOOK II.,"Afar, afar, O moaning Sea,"
634,BOOK II.,"My roving soul still follows thee,"
635,BOOK II.,"Still follows thee, still follows thee."
636,BOOK II.,
637,BOOK II.,O Whirlwind black--O strong!
638,BOOK II.,Thy scorching breath fierce burns the crouching land
639,BOOK II.,And thou dost sweep along
640,BOOK II.,"The raveled clouds. O Whirlwind, see--"
641,BOOK II.,"My spirit rising, follows thee,"
642,BOOK II.,"Still follows thee, still follows thee."
643,BOOK II.,
644,BOOK II.,"Nay, nay! My dauntless soul,"
645,BOOK II.,"Still higher than thy wing, O Eagle, soars,"
646,BOOK II.,And wider still than roll
647,BOOK II.,"Thy waves, and further than thy shores,"
648,BOOK II.,My spirit flees--O Sea--O Sea
649,BOOK II.,"No more it follows, follows thee."
650,BOOK II.,
651,BOOK II.,"Whirlwind, more strong than thou"
652,BOOK II.,"My soul, that fearless leaps to thine embrace"
653,BOOK II.,"And thy stern, wrinkled brow"
654,BOOK II.,"Doth tender touch and soothingly,"
655,BOOK II.,"And vassal art thou still to me,"
656,BOOK II.,"That no more, Whirlwind, follows thee."
657,BOOK II.,
658,BOOK II.,"Swift changed her mood, and darkened in her face."
659,BOOK II.,"As sometimes in an open, sunny place"
660,BOOK II.,"The sudden dusks o'er crinkling waters run,"
661,BOOK II.,So fell her thoughts to music. And as one
662,BOOK II.,"That grieves, she sang.  That lay--soft, weirdly clear,"
663,BOOK II.,The babbling waves made murmurous pause to hear:
664,BOOK II.,
665,BOOK II.,"Fair land (she sang), O sun-steeped realm of mine,"
666,BOOK II.,"The Sun, thy lover, hath his farewell kiss."
667,BOOK II.,I only pine
668,BOOK II.,While dim stars shine.
669,BOOK II.,
670,BOOK II.,Strong is thy Day-god! yet his parting kiss
671,BOOK II.,"Falls soft upon thy faltering lips. O land,"
672,BOOK II.,Thou hast a bliss
673,BOOK II.,I ever miss.
674,BOOK II.,
675,BOOK II.,"Fast comes the night, and warm, for thy dear sake,"
676,BOOK II.,"The shadows curtain dusk, thy lonely rest."
677,BOOK II.,I only wake
678,BOOK II.,My plaint to make.
679,BOOK II.,
680,BOOK II.,"Fair land, my lover cold, doth careless take"
681,BOOK II.,From my shut lips his flight. Here leaves me lone
682,BOOK II.,"My moan to make,"
683,BOOK II.,My heart to break.
684,BOOK II.,
685,BOOK II.,"She ceased. But still the song did float and fade,"
686,BOOK II.,"As failing sunshine soft, in woodland glade."
687,BOOK II.,"And Lilith, listening, heard--so wild, so shrill,"
688,BOOK II.,"Yet dream-like, far, again that tinkling rill"
689,BOOK II.,In Paradise. And o'er her spirit swept
690,BOOK II.,"A sadness bitter-sweet, as 'neath the green palms crept"
691,BOOK II.,"The wind, low-sighing, faint. As from lone nest"
692,BOOK II.,"A bird torn pinion lifts, striving to soar"
693,BOOK II.,"To shelter safe, so, Edenward once more"
694,BOOK II.,Turned Lilith's drooping thoughts.
695,BOOK II.,"Uprose she then,"
696,BOOK II.,"And brooding, homeward slowly went again."
697,BOOK II.,
698,BOOK II.,
699,BOOK II.,
700,BOOK II.,
701,BOOK III.,BOOK III.
702,BOOK III.,
703,BOOK III.,
704,BOOK III.,"Wide through her realm she walked, and glad or lorn"
705,BOOK III.,"She mused. So, loitering, it chanced one morn"
706,BOOK III.,"When lone she sat upon a mountain height,"
707,BOOK III.,"One sudden stood anear, whose dark eyes bright"
708,BOOK III.,"Upon her shone. Pallid his face, and red"
709,BOOK III.,"His smileless lips. ""Who art thou?"" Lilith said,"
710,BOOK III.,"And faint a hidden pain her hot heart stirred,"
711,BOOK III.,"When low, and rarely sweet, his voice she heard."
712,BOOK III.,"She looked, half-pleased--and half in strange surprise"
713,BOOK III.,"Shrank 'neath the gaze of those wild, starry eyes."
714,BOOK III.,"""Oh, dame,"" the stranger said, ""where waters leap"
715,BOOK III.,"Bright glancing down, I rested oft, where steep"
716,BOOK III.,"Thy Eden o'er, bare-browed, a peak uprose."
717,BOOK III.,"Naught craving bloom or fruitage--nay, nor those"
718,BOOK III.,Frail joys Adam holds dear. One only boon
719,BOOK III.,I sought of all his heritage. Fair 'neath the moon
720,BOOK III.,I saw thee stand; and all about thy feet
721,BOOK III.,"The night her perfume spilled, soft incense meet."
722,BOOK III.,"Then low I sighed, when grew thy beauty on my sight,"
723,BOOK III.,"'Some comfort yet remains, if that I might"
724,BOOK III.,From Adam pluck this perfect flower. Some morn--
725,BOOK III.,"If I (some dreamed-of morn, perchance slow-born)"
726,BOOK III.,"This flawless bloom, white, fragrant, lustrous, pure"
727,BOOK III.,For ever on my breast might hold secure.'
728,BOOK III.,"Yea, for thy love, through darkling realms of night"
729,BOOK III.,"I followed thee, sharing thy fearful flight"
730,BOOK III.,"Unseen. Lo, when thy timid heart, behind"
731,BOOK III.,"Heard echoing phantom feet upon the wind,"
732,BOOK III.,"'Twas I, pursuing o'er the day's last brink;"
733,BOOK III.,"Wherefore, I now am here. O Lilith, think"
734,BOOK III.,"How over-much I love thee, and how sweet"
735,BOOK III.,"Were life with thee! O weary naked feet,"
736,BOOK III.,With me each onward path wilt thou not tread?
737,BOOK III.,"Or, if thou endest here thy quest,"" he said,"
738,BOOK III.,"""Let me too bide with thee."""
739,BOOK III.,Made answer low
740,BOOK III.,"Lilith thereto: ""Meseems not long ago"
741,BOOK III.,One stood at Eden's gate like thee. But thy face
742,BOOK III.,"Is darker, red thy lips. Of kingly race"
743,BOOK III.,"I know thee. Say, whence comest thou, O prince?"""
744,BOOK III.,"""Nay, then,"" he sighed, ""an outcast I, long since"
745,BOOK III.,"From Heaven thrust out; yet now, the curse is past,"
746,BOOK III.,"Nor mourn I Heaven lost, if at the last"
747,BOOK III.,"Thy love I win. Yea, where thou art, I know"
748,BOOK III.,"Is Heaven. And bliss, in sooth"" (oh, soft and low,"
749,BOOK III.,"He said), ""lives ever in thy smile."""
750,BOOK III.,His speech
751,BOOK III.,Thus ended. And toward the sandy beach
752,BOOK III.,He passed. Though long her eyes the stranger sought
753,BOOK III.,"Where curved the distant shore, she saw him not."
754,BOOK III.,
755,BOOK III.,Soft through the trees the mottled shadows dropped
756,BOOK III.,When Lilith in her pleasance sat. Half-propped
757,BOOK III.,'Gainst mossy trunk her slender length. Her hair
758,BOOK III.,"In sunny web, enmeshed her elbows bare."
759,BOOK III.,Slowly the breeze swayed the mimosas slight
760,BOOK III.,As Eblis pushed aside the bent boughs light.
761,BOOK III.,"""O dame,"" he said, ""it seemeth surely meet"
762,BOOK III.,Earth's richest gifts to lay at Lilith's feet;
763,BOOK III.,"Therefore I said 'unto the fairest one,"
764,BOOK III.,Things loveliest beneath the shining sun
765,BOOK III.,I bring.' Since of all crafts in this young earth
766,BOOK III.,"I am true master, unto her whose worth"
767,BOOK III.,"So much deserves, I bear this marble sphere,"
768,BOOK III.,"Whose hollowed husk, well polished, gleaming clear,"
769,BOOK III.,"Hides rarest fruit."" Therewith the globe he showed,"
770,BOOK III.,The half whereof smooth-sparkling was: Half glowed
771,BOOK III.,"With carven work; embossed with pale leaves light,"
772,BOOK III.,"And delicately sculptured birds in flight,"
773,BOOK III.,And clustered flowers frail. Lilith drew near
774,BOOK III.,"With beaming eyes, and laid the graven sphere"
775,BOOK III.,Against her smiling lips; o'ertraced the vine
776,BOOK III.,"That circled it with fingers slim. ""Mine, mine"
777,BOOK III.,"Is it, O prince?"" she cried. ""I know not why"
778,BOOK III.,Its beauty doth recall the winds' long sigh
779,BOOK III.,That surged among the palms.  Methinks is dead
780,BOOK III.,"Some summer-tide, that in its own sweet stead"
781,BOOK III.,"Hath left upon the stone its imaging."""
782,BOOK III.,"Eblis replied: ""On earth, is anything"
783,BOOK III.,"More fair? If such thou knowest, Lilith, speak."
784,BOOK III.,"That I, for thee, surely would straightway seek."
785,BOOK III.,"Say, if indeed thou findest anywhere,"
786,BOOK III.,"On land or sea, created things so rare?"""
787,BOOK III.,"And Lilith answered, ""On this earth so round,"
788,BOOK III.,Naught else so lovely anywhere I found.
789,BOOK III.,So shames it meaner work--so had I said--
790,BOOK III.,But see yon nodding palm that droops its head
791,BOOK III.,Low sighing o'er the wave. Bring me a bough
792,BOOK III.,So feathery-fine. Turn thy white sphere! Now
793,BOOK III.,"On its cold, fair surface, Eblis, canst thou"
794,BOOK III.,"Such branches carve, or tender fronds, that we"
795,BOOK III.,"Bright waving on the cocoa, these may see?"""
796,BOOK III.,And Eblis wrought till grew upon the stone
797,BOOK III.,Such airy boughs as on the cocoa shone.
798,BOOK III.,"Then Lilith cried: ""Skilled craftsman, proven thou!"
799,BOOK III.,"Didst thou, then, make my cocoa-tree? Thy bough"
800,BOOK III.,Pale graven give the grace of its green crown
801,BOOK III.,When through it night winds gently slip adown.
802,BOOK III.,"No charm of color, nor of change, nor glow"
803,BOOK III.,"Of blue noon sky, thy carven work doth show;"
804,BOOK III.,Let dusk bees visit it--or sip the breath
805,BOOK III.,"From thy chill marble buds."" Then, Lilith saith,"
806,BOOK III.,"""Eblis hath wroughten noblest on this earth."""
807,BOOK III.,"He answered quick, ""Poor bauble, little worth"
808,BOOK III.,"To Lilith! Ope thy slighted husk, reveal"
809,BOOK III.,"The miracle thy rough rind doth conceal!"""
810,BOOK III.,
811,BOOK III.,"He touched a hidden spring, and wide apart"
812,BOOK III.,"The riven sphere showed its white hollow heart,"
813,BOOK III.,And in the midst a gem; the which he laid
814,BOOK III.,"Within her hand. ""Behold,"" he said, ""I made"
815,BOOK III.,"Most fair for thee this lustrous blood-red sard,"
816,BOOK III.,And deftly traced its gleaming surface hard
817,BOOK III.,"With carvings thick of bright acacias slim,"
818,BOOK III.,Pomegranates lush and river-reeds. Its rim
819,BOOK III.,"A spray of leaves enchased, white as with rime"
820,BOOK III.,"Night fallen. 'Slow drags the lagging time,'"
821,BOOK III.,"I said, 'till one day shines upon the breast"
822,BOOK III.,"Of her, whose perfect beauty worthiest"
823,BOOK III.,"It decks, this gem.' The token, Lilith, take;"
824,BOOK III.,"If lovelier there be, for Eblis' sake"
825,BOOK III.,"Keep silent; yet with me, oh Lilith, go"
826,BOOK III.,Awhile from thine own land. Then shall I know
827,BOOK III.,"The gem finds favor in thine eyes."""
828,BOOK III.,Then she
829,BOOK III.,Turned from her pleasance and all silently
830,BOOK III.,"Passed to the sea, across the yellow strand"
831,BOOK III.,"That, glimmering, ringed her shadowy land."
832,BOOK III.,"""Oh cool,"" he said, ""the lucent waves that fret"
833,BOOK III.,"The barren shore, and curl their scattered spray wet"
834,BOOK III.,'Gainst thy hand. Come! my longing pinnace waits
835,BOOK III.,To bear thee far. Her slender keel now grates
836,BOOK III.,Upon the beach; and swift her shapely prow
837,BOOK III.,"Will skim the deep, as swallows' fleet wing. Thou"
838,BOOK III.,Seest! comely and strong it is. For thee
839,BOOK III.,"Its golden sails, its purple canopy."
840,BOOK III.,"With skin of spotted pard, I cushioned it."
841,BOOK III.,"Ere the fresh breeze doth die, light let us flit"
842,BOOK III.,"Across the sea. No craft so proud, so staunch,"
843,BOOK III.,Goes glancing through the foam.  I safely launch
844,BOOK III.,"Her now, and speed to fairy isles. Come thou"
845,BOOK III.,"With me.""  And glad she crossed the burnished prow;"
846,BOOK III.,"And 'mong the thick furred rugs sat down. ""Oh craft,"
847,BOOK III.,"Fair fashioned, lightly built, speed far,"" she laughed;"
848,BOOK III.,"""To other lands bear Lilith safe."""
849,BOOK III.,As sailed
850,BOOK III.,"They idly on, her slender hand she trailed"
851,BOOK III.,"Among the waves, and sudden cried, ""Indeed,"
852,BOOK III.,A craft stauncher than thine floats by. What need
853,BOOK III.,"Hath it of helm, or prow, or silken sail,"
854,BOOK III.,Sure harbor finding when the ocean gale
855,BOOK III.,"Fast drives it onward?"" A nut she drew, round,"
856,BOOK III.,"Rough, coarse-husked, forth from the wave. ""Lo, I found,"""
857,BOOK III.,"She said, ""this boat well built. The cocoa-tree"
858,BOOK III.,"Cast it amid the foam. Its pilot free,"
859,BOOK III.,"The summer wind; its port, the misty shore"
860,BOOK III.,"Of ocean isles. It fades from sight. 'No more,'"
861,BOOK III.,"We say, 'it sails the wild uncertain main,'"
862,BOOK III.,"But when the drifting days are gone, again"
863,BOOK III.,"We turn our prow, and reach the barren isles"
864,BOOK III.,"Where, stranded as we went, the nut. Now smiles"
865,BOOK III.,"Above; a bending tree. Aloud we cry,"
866,BOOK III.,'A miracle is wrought!' We draw anigh.
867,BOOK III.,"Behold, the cocoa, towering, doth spring"
868,BOOK III.,Forth from the brown nut's heart. About it cling
869,BOOK III.,Sweet odors faint; and far stars trembling peep.
870,BOOK III.,When through its bowers cool the breezes creep.
871,BOOK III.,"Strong, indeed, thy boat, well builded! I wis"
872,BOOK III.,"There be yet other craft as firm, Eblis,"
873,BOOK III.,That o'er these trackless waters boldly glide.
874,BOOK III.,"Brave Nautilus afar, doth fearless ride,"
875,BOOK III.,"With sails of gossamer. So, too, doth spread,"
876,BOOK III.,"To summer airs, his silken gleaming thread,"
877,BOOK III.,"The water-spider fleet, free sailor true"
878,BOOK III.,"That in the sunshine floats, beneath the blue,"
879,BOOK III.,"Glad skies. And through the deep, all sparkling, slip"
880,BOOK III.,"A thousand insect-swarms, that, rippling, dip"
881,BOOK III.,Amid the merry waves. Bright voyagers
882,BOOK III.,"That roam the sultry seas! Look, the wind stirs"
883,BOOK III.,Our creaking sails! Thy pinnace flying o'er
884,BOOK III.,"The ocean's swell, fast leaves the fading shore;"
885,BOOK III.,"Yet faster still the Nautilus sails by,"
886,BOOK III.,And darts the spider quick. And swifter fly
887,BOOK III.,The insect-fleets among the foam; yet think
888,BOOK III.,Not when among the billows wild doth sink
889,BOOK III.,"Thy bounding boat, I fear. Nor would I slight"
890,BOOK III.,"Thy skill, that made it strong, and swift, and light,"
891,BOOK III.,"And trimmed it gayly, for my sake."""
892,BOOK III.,Now near
893,BOOK III.,"A jutting shore Prince Eblis drew, where sheer"
894,BOOK III.,"The brown rocks rose. And just beyond, a slim"
895,BOOK III.,Beach of white sand curved to the ocean's brim.
896,BOOK III.,"Thereto he came, and high upon the strand"
897,BOOK III.,"Drew the boat's keel. ""Welcome, fair queen, to land"
898,BOOK III.,"That Eblis rules,"" he said. ""I fain would show"
899,BOOK III.,Thee what thou hast not seen in the warm glow
900,BOOK III.,Of thy glad home. This blighted shore of mine
901,BOOK III.,"No verdure hath, nor bloom, nor fruits that shine"
902,BOOK III.,'Mong drooping boughs.  Far inland gloom lone peaks
903,BOOK III.,O'er blackened meads; or from their bare cones leaps
904,BOOK III.,"Gaunt, crackling flame; or crawl like ashen veins"
905,BOOK III.,The smouldering fires across the stricken plains.
906,BOOK III.,Deep in these yawning caves black shadows lie
907,BOOK III.,"That shall be lifted never more. Come, I"
908,BOOK III.,Enter! Know thou what treasure by the sea
909,BOOK III.,"I gathered other time."" Therewith showed he"
910,BOOK III.,Hid 'mong the high heaped rocks a dusky grot
911,BOOK III.,Where never sunshine fell. A dismal spot
912,BOOK III.,Where dank the sea-weeds coiled and cold the air
913,BOOK III.,"Swept through. And stooping, Eblis downward rolled"
914,BOOK III.,"Before her webs of woven stuff, in fold"
915,BOOK III.,"Of purple sheen, enwrought with flecks of gold."
916,BOOK III.,"Great wefts of scarlet and of blue, thick strewn"
917,BOOK III.,"With pearls, or cleft with discs of jacinth stone;"
918,BOOK III.,"And drifts of silky woof and samite white,"
919,BOOK III.,And warps of Orient hues. Eblis light
920,BOOK III.,Wound round her neck a scarf of amber. Wide
921,BOOK III.,"Its smooth folds sweeping flowed; and proud he cried,"
922,BOOK III.,"""Among these hills, in the still loom of night,"
923,BOOK III.,"I wrought for Lilith's pleasing, all. And bright"
924,BOOK III.,"Have spun these webs, in blended morning hues"
925,BOOK III.,And noontide shades and trail of silver dews--
926,BOOK III.,Hereon have set fair traceries of cloud-shine
927,BOOK III.,And tints of the far vales. The textures fine
928,BOOK III.,Glow with sweet thoughts of thee. And otherwhere
929,BOOK III.,"Hast thou such fabrics seen, or colors rare"
930,BOOK III.,"As these?"" Dawned in her eyes a swift delight,"
931,BOOK III.,"And low she cried, ""Oh, wondrous is the sight,"
932,BOOK III.,"And much it pleaseth me. But yet,"" she said,"
933,BOOK III.,"""Beside my knee one morn, its hooded head"
934,BOOK III.,A Hagè reared. Its gliding shape so near
935,BOOK III.,"To subtler music moved, than my dull ear"
936,BOOK III.,"Could catch. Its velvet skin I gently strake,"
937,BOOK III.,Watching the light that o'er its heaped coils brake
938,BOOK III.,"In glittering waves. Within its small, wise glance,"
939,BOOK III.,"Flame silent slept, or quick in baleful dance"
940,BOOK III.,Before my startled gaze quivering did wake.
941,BOOK III.,"Fair is thy woof, soft woven, yet the snake"
942,BOOK III.,Out-dazzles it. The beetle that doth boom
943,BOOK III.,"Its dull life out among the tangled gloom,"
944,BOOK III.,"Lift his wide wing above thy weft, or trail"
945,BOOK III.,"His splendor there, and thy poor web will pale;"
946,BOOK III.,"Yea, the red wayside lily that doth snare"
947,BOOK III.,"The girdled bee, is softer still, more fair"
948,BOOK III.,"Than finest woven cloth."" But tenderly"
949,BOOK III.,"She smoothed the gleaming folds. ""Much pleaseth me,"
950,BOOK III.,"Natlhess,"" she said, ""such loveliness."" Then brought"
951,BOOK III.,"He tapestries of fleeces fine, well wrought"
952,BOOK III.,"In colors soft as woodland mosses' tinge,"
953,BOOK III.,Or glow of autumn blooms: Heavy with fringe
954,BOOK III.,"Of downward sweeping gold; arras, where through"
955,BOOK III.,"Showed mottled stripes, or arabesques of blue,"
956,BOOK III.,"Broad zones of red, and tender grays, and hue"
957,BOOK III.,"Of dropping leaves. ""Lilith,"" he said, ""when rolled"
958,BOOK III.,"The storm-tossed billows round these caves, behold"
959,BOOK III.,I spun these daintily. 'Twere hard to find
960,BOOK III.,"Such twisted weft or woven strand."" ""Oh, kind,"""
961,BOOK III.,"She said, ""is Eblis, unto whom I fain"
962,BOOK III.,Would give due thanks. His gorgeous train
963,BOOK III.,But yesterday I saw the peacock spread;
964,BOOK III.,Bright in the sun gleamed his small crested head;
965,BOOK III.,"His haughty neck wrinkled to green and blue,"
966,BOOK III.,"And since I needs must truly speak, I knew"
967,BOOK III.,Not color rich as his: and I have seen
968,BOOK III.,"The curious nest among the branches green,"
969,BOOK III.,"The busy weaver-bird plaits of thick leaves,"
970,BOOK III.,And in and out its pliant meshes weaves;
971,BOOK III.,"And since thou sayest 'twere hard to match thy fine,"
972,BOOK III.,"Strong, woven fabrics, watch the weaver twine"
973,BOOK III.,"His cunning wefts. Though still,"" she said, ""think not"
974,BOOK III.,"I scorn thy gifts, Prince Eblis; for I wot"
975,BOOK III.,"Their worth is greater than my tongue can say."""
976,BOOK III.,"Then Eblis deeper in the cave led her a little way,"
977,BOOK III.,And showed a stately screen of such fine art
978,BOOK III.,One almost felt the breeze that seemed to part
979,BOOK III.,The pictured boughs. And o'er the stirless lake
980,BOOK III.,"Dreamed the swift, wimpling waters sudden brake"
981,BOOK III.,Among the willows on its brink--and flowers
982,BOOK III.,"Of scarlet, shining-clean from summer showers;"
983,BOOK III.,"And Eblis said, ""Cold praise a friend should spare"
984,BOOK III.,This picture true. Certain naught else will dare
985,BOOK III.,"Vie with such beauty."""
986,BOOK III.,Archly Lilith took
987,BOOK III.,"The rose from her bright hair, and lightly shook"
988,BOOK III.,"The dewdrop from its heart. ""I loving, touch,"""
989,BOOK III.,"She said, ""these petals smooth. O, Eblis, such"
990,BOOK III.,Give to thy painted blooms; give its cool sheen
991,BOOK III.,"Of morningtide, the mossy, lush leaves green"
992,BOOK III.,"That fold it round. Give its faint, fragrant breath,"
993,BOOK III.,When with the fickle breeze it dallieth.
994,BOOK III.,"Nay, fairer still my rose than gilded screen,"
995,BOOK III.,"Though it be limned with perfect art, I ween."""
996,BOOK III.,"Thereat smiled Eblis bitterly. ""I bring"
997,BOOK III.,"One parting gift,"" he said, ""a dainty thing;"
998,BOOK III.,Perchance in other time it will recall
999,BOOK III.,One who strove long and patiently through all
1000,BOOK III.,"These days to win thy praise."" An oval plane"
1001,BOOK III.,Of crystal gave he her; of fleck or stain
1002,BOOK III.,Clear-gleaming. Of ivory carven fine
1003,BOOK III.,"The frame. And when she looked, ""Divine,"""
1004,BOOK III.,"He laughed, ""the beauty it enshrines. Canst claim"
1005,BOOK III.,"Aught else is fairer?"" And Lilith again"
1006,BOOK III.,"Gazed in the glass, her face beholding there,"
1007,BOOK III.,"Her pink flushed cheeks, her yellow streaming hair."
1008,BOOK III.,"Quick came her breath. ""O prince,"" she slowly said,"
1009,BOOK III.,"""Fair is the stranger. Bid those lips so red"
1010,BOOK III.,Speak once to Lilith. For methinks the voice
1011,BOOK III.,Of such in music flowed. Let me rejoice
1012,BOOK III.,"Therein."" ""O glorious counterfeit!"" cried"
1013,BOOK III.,"He. ""Lovelier is not on this earth wide!"
1014,BOOK III.,"Behold, sweet Lilith, 'tis thine own pure face"
1015,BOOK III.,That lends my happy mirror perfect grace
1016,BOOK III.,It else had not. Bid thou thine image speak!
1017,BOOK III.,"No other happiness I elsewhere seek,"
1018,BOOK III.,"If the soft tale she whispers be of me."""
1019,BOOK III.,"And Lilith answered gravely, ""I know thee,"
1020,BOOK III.,Eblis. Master indeed of all crafts thou--
1021,BOOK III.,"Red Sard, and marble sphere, and agile prow"
1022,BOOK III.,Of pinnace light well wroughten were by thee
1023,BOOK III.,"And decked full fair. And, beauteous to see,"
1024,BOOK III.,"Fine woven weft and web, and the tall screen"
1025,BOOK III.,"O'errun with painted bloom, crystal, with gleam"
1026,BOOK III.,Of Lilith's face--thou madest these. Mayhap
1027,BOOK III.,Beetle and asp likewise didst tint--didst wrap
1028,BOOK III.,"The green about my rose, and richly fringe"
1029,BOOK III.,"My cocoa-tree, or peacock's train didst tinge"
1030,BOOK III.,"With dazzling hues. Methought thou wert a prince,"
1031,BOOK III.,"But now Lilith should humbly kneel, since"
1032,BOOK III.,"Thou art far higher than she deemed, if thou"
1033,BOOK III.,"Madest these wondrous things."" And lowly now"
1034,BOOK III.,"As she would kneel, she drew anigh. But he"
1035,BOOK III.,"Cried, shrinking, ""Nay, I made them not."" And she"
1036,BOOK III.,"Low questioned, ""Eblis, tell me who then, did make"
1037,BOOK III.,Them all. Who set the creeping hooded snake
1038,BOOK III.,"And stealthy pard within the thorny brake,"
1039,BOOK III.,"And spread the sea, and wreathed the waterfall"
1040,BOOK III.,"With foam? Who reared the hoar hills, towering tall"
1041,BOOK III.,"Above the lands?"" With eyes wild flashing, low"
1042,BOOK III.,"He groaned: ""O Lilith, ask me not. My foe"
1043,BOOK III.,He was--he is. Trembles with wrath my frame
1044,BOOK III.,"If I but faintly breathe his awful name."""
1045,BOOK III.,"Lilith replied, ""Meseemeth, master true"
1046,BOOK III.,"Of every craft is He."""
1047,BOOK III.,Forth the two
1048,BOOK III.,From that drear cavern passed. Ere the water's brim
1049,BOOK III.,"They gained, he plucked the wilding reeds, that slim"
1050,BOOK III.,"Stood by a brook. ""My pipe I make, one strain"
1051,BOOK III.,Harmonious to wake. Nor yet again
1052,BOOK III.,Shalt thou such fresh notes hear. Music like mine
1053,BOOK III.,"Methinks thou hast not known in any time."""
1054,BOOK III.,"He laid his pipe unto his lips, and blew"
1055,BOOK III.,"A blast, wild, piercing, sweet. The far hills through"
1056,BOOK III.,"It rung. And softer fell, yet wild and clear."
1057,BOOK III.,"It ceased. With drooping eyes, ""Once I did hear"
1058,BOOK III.,"A song as wildly clear, as sad,"" she said,"
1059,BOOK III.,"""In mine own realm."" And as she spoke, dark dread"
1060,BOOK III.,"The sky grew with a coming storm. ""Oh, haste,"""
1061,BOOK III.,"He cried; ""seek refuge ere this dreary waste"
1062,BOOK III.,"Reeks with the rain!"" And fast they sped"
1063,BOOK III.,"Back to his ocean-cave. There safe, o'erhead"
1064,BOOK III.,They watched the piling clouds. With angry roar
1065,BOOK III.,The baffled billows broke upon the rocks. O'er
1066,BOOK III.,Them rushed the shrieking storm. Wild through the grot
1067,BOOK III.,"Wandered the prisoned wind, a troubled ghost that sought"
1068,BOOK III.,"Repose. Or low did moan, and trembling, wail,"
1069,BOOK III.,"Like some sore-hearted thing that hideth, pale,"
1070,BOOK III.,"And dare not front the day; and wilder still,"
1071,BOOK III.,"In chords melodious, swelled or sank, until"
1072,BOOK III.,"She sighed, ""Oh, this weird harp among the caves,"
1073,BOOK III.,"Strange players hath! For loud as one that raves,"
1074,BOOK III.,It rises. Now more sweetly fade away
1075,BOOK III.,"Its mellow notes than thy thin pipes."" ""One day,"""
1076,BOOK III.,"He said, ""mayhap my strain may please, when wind"
1077,BOOK III.,Doth not outpipe my slighted reeds. Unkind
1078,BOOK III.,"Thou art."" ""The storm is past; to mine own land"
1079,BOOK III.,"I would return,"" she said.  And Eblis o'er the strand"
1080,BOOK III.,Led her. And homeward silent turned his prow
1081,BOOK III.,That swiftly through the swirling waves did plow.
1082,BOOK III.,"But when they parted, Eblis mused, ""I know"
1083,BOOK III.,"No gift soever winneth her, rich though"
1084,BOOK III.,"It be and seemly. Into this pure soul,"
1085,BOOK III.,"Through fear of ill, I enter; or by goal"
1086,BOOK III.,"Of future gain before it set."""
1087,BOOK III.,So came
1088,BOOK III.,He to her pleasance yet again. A flame
1089,BOOK III.,"Leaped high above a brazier that he bore,"
1090,BOOK III.,"Its sweet, white, scented wood quick lapping o'er."
1091,BOOK III.,With darkened face Eblis above her hung.
1092,BOOK III.,"""This hath, than my poor pipe, a keener tongue,"""
1093,BOOK III.,"Smileless and stern, he said. ""Oh, dame,"
1094,BOOK III.,"List how the wild, crisp, crackling ruby flame"
1095,BOOK III.,Eats through the tender boughs. A trusty knave
1096,BOOK III.,"It is, that serves me well, and loud doth rave"
1097,BOOK III.,"As tiger caged. When I do set it free,"
1098,BOOK III.,"With angry fangs leaps on its prey. But see,"
1099,BOOK III.,"It now sleeps harmlessly, till Eblis calls"
1100,BOOK III.,"His faithful servant back. Lilith, when falls"
1101,BOOK III.,"The red fire at thy feet, dost fear?"" ""Nay, nay,"""
1102,BOOK III.,"She cried, and drew her white neck up.  ""A way"
1103,BOOK III.,"To tame it thou hast found. Believe me, since"
1104,BOOK III.,"It is thy slave I too will bind it, prince."
1105,BOOK III.,"Should Lilith fear? Unfaltering, these eyes"
1106,BOOK III.,"Have watched when rushing storm-clouds heaped the skies,"
1107,BOOK III.,"And the black whirlwind, with loud, deafening roar,"
1108,BOOK III.,Beat the torn waves; or whirled against the shore
1109,BOOK III.,"The tumbling billows, with fierce lips that bit"
1110,BOOK III.,The shrinking land. And the wreathed lightnings split
1111,BOOK III.,The cloud with thunder dread: or wildly burst
1112,BOOK III.,Upon the sea the water-spout. Shall first
1113,BOOK III.,"She fear thy flame, who feared not these?"" ""Fit mate"
1114,BOOK III.,"Art thou for Eblis,"" answered he. ""His fate"
1115,BOOK III.,"Share, great-souled one. Thou wouldst not meanly shrink,"
1116,BOOK III.,"Though his strong heart did fail. O Lilith, think!"
1117,BOOK III.,"The crown of clustered worlds thou mayest find,"
1118,BOOK III.,If thou with him who loveth thee wilt bind
1119,BOOK III.,"Thy life."" ""Nay, far happier seems to me"
1120,BOOK III.,"Than eagle caged, the wild lark soaring free,"""
1121,BOOK III.,She said. And through her rose-pleached alleys strayed
1122,BOOK III.,They to the sea. And tender music made
1123,BOOK III.,That guileful voice; yet slow his wooing sped
1124,BOOK III.,Those summer days. But when were dead
1125,BOOK III.,"And brown the crisping leaves, ""Oh, love,"" he said,"
1126,BOOK III.,"""Of all the centuries, thou rarest bloom,"
1127,BOOK III.,"Thy shut heart open wide. Its sweet perfume,"
1128,BOOK III.,"Though I should die, fain would I parting drink."
1129,BOOK III.,"Sleeps yet thy love? From me no longer shrink,"
1130,BOOK III.,"My Lilith. Oh, lift up thy tender eyes;"
1131,BOOK III.,In their blue depths doth happy morning rise;
1132,BOOK III.,"'Tis night if they be closed."""
1133,BOOK III.,She softly sighed;
1134,BOOK III.,"And ancient strife recalling, thus replied:"
1135,BOOK III.,"""When dwelt a prince discrowned, well satisfied?"
1136,BOOK III.,"And fallen, loving, still art thou a prince,"
1137,BOOK III.,"And otherwhiles might sorrow bring me, since"
1138,BOOK III.,"It might hap thou wouldst much desire her realm,"
1139,BOOK III.,Were Lilith thine; for princes seize the helm
1140,BOOK III.,"When Love lies moored, and bid the shallop seek"
1141,BOOK III.,"Across the waves new lands. But Love is weak,"
1142,BOOK III.,"And so, alas, the craft upon the sands"
1143,BOOK III.,"Is dashed, while one, on-looking, wrings her hands."
1144,BOOK III.,"Such days I have outlived. Like Adam, thou"
1145,BOOK III.,Perchance will seek to bind the loosed. Then how
1146,BOOK III.,(If one hath drunken wine of liberty)
1147,BOOK III.,"Shall she, athirst, rejoice; no longer free,"
1148,BOOK III.,"Be glad?"""
1149,BOOK III.,"""My love,"" he said, ""large-hearted lives,"
1150,BOOK III.,"Full dowers thee, and royal bounty gives,"
1151,BOOK III.,"Nor knoweth law, save Lilith's wish alone."""
1152,BOOK III.,"""Why, then,"" she answered, ""on the polished stone"
1153,BOOK III.,"That fronts yon hill, write, Eblis, in full day,"
1154,BOOK III.,"That other time we read it clear, and say,"
1155,BOOK III.,'Hereon are graven all those early vows
1156,BOOK III.,"We whispered low aneath the summer boughs,'"
1157,BOOK III.,Write every word. That so the stone shall be
1158,BOOK III.,Ever a witness mute twixt thee and me.
1159,BOOK III.,Then shall I know thou seekest in me no thrall
1160,BOOK III.,"For after-days, if thou make compact. All"
1161,BOOK III.,"Thou hast said, write now."""
1162,BOOK III.,"Then on the stone,"
1163,BOOK III.,"As she had said, graved Eblis, and thereon"
1164,BOOK III.,Did set his seal. So wedded they: and hand
1165,BOOK III.,In hand the wide world roamed. Or in her land
1166,BOOK III.,"Abode. And oft, of hours, ere yet on earth"
1167,BOOK III.,"He walked, she questioned.  Or he loosed with mirth"
1168,BOOK III.,"Her yellow hair, down-streaming o'er his arm;"
1169,BOOK III.,And 'gainst his cheek her breath came sweet and warm;
1170,BOOK III.,As through his dusky locks caressing played
1171,BOOK III.,"Her fingers slim; and shadows, half afraid,"
1172,BOOK III.,She saw in his wild eyes.
1173,BOOK III.,Or paths remote
1174,BOOK III.,"They trod, watching the white clouds rise and float"
1175,BOOK III.,"Athwart the sky. Or by the listless main,"
1176,BOOK III.,"Or 'neath the lotus bough, slow paced the twain."
1177,BOOK III.,Or dragon-trees spread their cool leafy screen.
1178,BOOK III.,"And faint crept odors through the mangroves green,"
1179,BOOK III.,Where paused the pair upon the sandy shore.
1180,BOOK III.,"Love-tranced, unheeded, swiftly passed them o'er"
1181,BOOK III.,Glad summer days: till one hour softly laid
1182,BOOK III.,"At Lilith's feet a fair, lone babe, that strayed"
1183,BOOK III.,From distant Dreamland far. So might one deem
1184,BOOK III.,"That looked upon its face. Or, it might seem"
1185,BOOK III.,"From other climes, a rose-leaf blown apart,"
1186,BOOK III.,"Down-fluttered there, to gladden Lilith's heart."

1194,BOOK IV.,To that fair Elf-child other summers came;
1195,BOOK IV.,"But Lilith walked, heart-hungered, filled with shame,"
1196,BOOK IV.,Naught comforted. And in that shadow-land
1197,BOOK IV.,"She sorrowing bore, in after-time, a band"
1198,BOOK IV.,"Of elfin babes, that waked dim echoes long"
1199,BOOK IV.,"Forgotten there, and ghastly bursts of song."
1200,BOOK IV.,"Then Lilith saddened more, for that she knew"
1201,BOOK IV.,The curse was fallen now. And cried she through
1202,BOOK IV.,"Fast-falling tears, ""Oh, me most desolate,"
1203,BOOK IV.,That shall not know in any time the fate
1204,BOOK IV.,"Of happier mothers! Nay, nor cool touch"
1205,BOOK IV.,"Of baby hands. Oh, longed-for, loved so much!"
1206,BOOK IV.,"Alas, my babes, ere yet hour-old ye fly,"
1207,BOOK IV.,"Out-spreading shining wings with jeering cry,"
1208,BOOK IV.,"Afar from me. Most hapless I, from whom"
1209,BOOK IV.,"The crown of motherhood, yet white with bloom,"
1210,BOOK IV.,Falls blighted! Close in these empty arms fain
1211,BOOK IV.,Would I clasp my babes! My tender pain
1212,BOOK IV.,"But once could ye not solace? Nay, 'tis vain;"
1213,BOOK IV.,"I shall not kiss their lips, nor hear again,"
1214,BOOK IV.,"As gladder mothers may, low-rippling, sweet,"
1215,BOOK IV.,The laughter children bring about their feet.
1216,BOOK IV.,"Oh, soulless ones, can ye not wait awhile,"
1217,BOOK IV.,"'Till on your loveless lips I wake one smile?"""
1218,BOOK IV.,But merrily out-laughed the phantom crew;
1219,BOOK IV.,"On shining pinions white, swift seaward flew,"
1220,BOOK IV.,"Or upward rose, slow-fading in the blue;"
1221,BOOK IV.,"Or lured her trembling, green morasses through."
1222,BOOK IV.,And 'mong the frothy waves they vanished fast;
1223,BOOK IV.,"Or shrieked with glee borne on the wintry blast,"
1224,BOOK IV.,And wilder raised their warlock song.
1225,BOOK IV.,While fairer grew each day that elfin throng.
1226,BOOK IV.,
1227,BOOK IV.,"To pluck the mangoes brown, fair Lilith sped"
1228,BOOK IV.,One morn. Quick throbbed her heart. On mossy bed
1229,BOOK IV.,"Lay all her babes. With face like morning, shone"
1230,BOOK IV.,"One there, and wide her yellow hair out-blown"
1231,BOOK IV.,"As 'twere in play. Red-flushed her cheeks, and deep"
1232,BOOK IV.,About her lips the baby smiles. Asleep
1233,BOOK IV.,"Was one, white-gleaming, pure as pearl unseen"
1234,BOOK IV.,"In sunless caves, close-shut. And one did lean"
1235,BOOK IV.,"Against his fellow, lithe, sun-flushed and brown,"
1236,BOOK IV.,With rings of jetty hair that low adown
1237,BOOK IV.,"His bosom streamed. And one there was, whose dream"
1238,BOOK IV.,O'erflowed with laughter. And one did seem
1239,BOOK IV.,"Half-waking. One, with dimpled arms in sleep"
1240,BOOK IV.,"Thrust elbow-deep in moss, that sure did weep"
1241,BOOK IV.,"Ere yet he slept, and on his cheek scarce dried"
1242,BOOK IV.,The wilful tears.
1243,BOOK IV.,"Then low, pale Lilith cried"
1244,BOOK IV.,"As near she drew, down-bending tender eyes:"
1245,BOOK IV.,"""And are ye here, my babes; and will ye rise"
1246,BOOK IV.,"If I but break your sleep?"" His naked feet"
1247,BOOK IV.,One faintly moved as low she leant; and warm
1248,BOOK IV.,"His slumbrous breath stirred 'gainst her circling arm,"
1249,BOOK IV.,And slow aneath his closed lids slipped a waft
1250,BOOK IV.,"Of wind, that loosed a trickling tear. Its craft"
1251,BOOK IV.,"The mother-heart forgot thereat. ""At last,"
1252,BOOK IV.,"Close to my breast, my babes,"" she cried, and fast"
1253,BOOK IV.,"Laughing, outstretched her eager hands and strong."
1254,BOOK IV.,Then lay with empty arms.
1255,BOOK IV.,The elfin throng
1256,BOOK IV.,Breasted the pulsing air with mocking song.
1257,BOOK IV.,"""Alas,"" she said, ""could ye not give one kiss--"
1258,BOOK IV.,One tender clasp of hands! And must I miss
1259,BOOK IV.,"Your throbbing hearts from my cold, barren breast,"
1260,BOOK IV.,"Ye soulless ones, that flout my lonely rest?"""
1261,BOOK IV.,
1262,BOOK IV.,"There, prostrate, long lay Lilith, and there, late"
1263,BOOK IV.,"'Mid dew-fall, Eblis found his stricken mate."
1264,BOOK IV.,"""O Eblis, say o'er me what curse hangs bare,"
1265,BOOK IV.,"For now no more,"" she said, ""this realm seems fair."
1266,BOOK IV.,"Its fruits grow bitter, all its light falls chill."
1267,BOOK IV.,"With thee, my prince, poor Lilith mates but ill--"
1268,BOOK IV.,"Earth-born, with angel linked. Alas, is left"
1269,BOOK IV.,"No joy to me, of my sweet ones bereft."
1270,BOOK IV.,Methinks soft baby lips might erewhile drain
1271,BOOK IV.,From Lilith's famished heart its wildest pain.
1272,BOOK IV.,"Wherefore, my Eblis, it were wise to seek"
1273,BOOK IV.,"Surcease of grief. That Lilith, is so weak"
1274,BOOK IV.,"Who wedded thee; and that she sinned, knew not."
1275,BOOK IV.,"Yet, if we part, mayhap may follow naught"
1276,BOOK IV.,"Of other ills."""
1277,BOOK IV.,"""Sweet love,"" he laughed, ""o'er-late"
1278,BOOK IV.,Thou art so timorous. At Eden's gate
1279,BOOK IV.,"Not so, what time the angel barred her way"
1280,BOOK IV.,"My Lilith stood. Shelter within my arms. Oh, say,"
1281,BOOK IV.,Was not our young love sweet? Hath it grown cold?
1282,BOOK IV.,"With me thou sharest endless life; nor old,"
1283,BOOK IV.,"Nor shrivelled, shalt thou be. And not one trace"
1284,BOOK IV.,Of earth's decay (sure doom of thy sad race)
1285,BOOK IV.,"Shall taint thy babes. For lo, I give"
1286,BOOK IV.,Thy soulless ones immortal youth. They live
1287,BOOK IV.,"Without a pang. And yet, methinks the cry"
1288,BOOK IV.,"Of Earth adown the ages sounds, when die"
1289,BOOK IV.,"Its babes; and mothers bend dumb lips above,"
1290,BOOK IV.,"And fold still hands, that answer not their love."
1291,BOOK IV.,"Lilith, doth not indeed my love outweigh"
1292,BOOK IV.,Caresses missed from phantom babes? Astray
1293,BOOK IV.,"From Eden long, here in this fair domain"
1294,BOOK IV.,To bide; and through long cycles fearless reign
1295,BOOK IV.,Methinks were joy. In summer sheen
1296,BOOK IV.,Wide spreads thy land. The marge of islets green
1297,BOOK IV.,The palm-trees skirt. Soft shine the dusk lagoons
1298,BOOK IV.,"And inland mountains. Mirk the jungle's glooms,"
1299,BOOK IV.,"And fair thy fertile plains. Oh, sweet the glow"
1300,BOOK IV.,"When we together watch the day, that low"
1301,BOOK IV.,Among the winds lies still. Shut lilies blow
1302,BOOK IV.,"While here we wait. Come, for they fain would show"
1303,BOOK IV.,"Their golden hearts. Or, love, with me to float"
1304,BOOK IV.,"Were it not sweet, through flowery bays remote,"
1305,BOOK IV.,"Past coves and peaks? Or pierce yon ocean's verge,"
1306,BOOK IV.,"And through wild tumbling waves our sails to urge?"""
1307,BOOK IV.,"""Yea, sweet is love,"" she said, ""and sweet to roam"
1308,BOOK IV.,By listless currents lulled; or 'mid the foam
1309,BOOK IV.,"Low dip our feathery oars,"" she sighed, ""yet sore"
1310,BOOK IV.,Is still the mother-heart that hears no more
1311,BOOK IV.,"The lisping tongues. And sad, when baby smiles"
1312,BOOK IV.,Have left it desolate. And baby wiles
1313,BOOK IV.,"Shall cheer it never more."""
1314,BOOK IV.,"""Yet,"" Eblis said,"
1315,BOOK IV.,"""Lilith, no longer mourn. For I have read"
1316,BOOK IV.,"Upon a scroll as samite glistening white,"
1317,BOOK IV.,"All coming fate, close hid from human sight,"
1318,BOOK IV.,Great peoples yet shall dwell in these dusk lands.
1319,BOOK IV.,"Then shall thy children, shadowy bands"
1320,BOOK IV.,"That fly thy fond caress, with them abide"
1321,BOOK IV.,In closest fellowship. And though they hide
1322,BOOK IV.,"Sometimes from human ken their better selves,"
1323,BOOK IV.,"Still loved, remain these tricksy elves."
1324,BOOK IV.,"Though yet indeed some quips and pranks they play,"
1325,BOOK IV.,"'Tis but a jest, men know, when far away"
1326,BOOK IV.,The flickering marsh-fires swift they light
1327,BOOK IV.,And children follow their false tapers bright
1328,BOOK IV.,"Among the spongy bogs. The ship-lad smiles,"
1329,BOOK IV.,When distant 'mid the waves the phantom isles
1330,BOOK IV.,Rise green. 'Tis but a harmless jest that sets
1331,BOOK IV.,"On lonely plains, domes, mosques, and minarets,"
1332,BOOK IV.,"And o'er the desert sands, mirage uplifts"
1333,BOOK IV.,When glimmering waves shine through deep rifts
1334,BOOK IV.,Of crested palms.
1335,BOOK IV.,"""Still dearer they when wide"
1336,BOOK IV.,To undiscovered lands men boldly ride
1337,BOOK IV.,"Across new seas, and turn their venturous prows."
1338,BOOK IV.,"When tempests shriek, and wet about their brows"
1339,BOOK IV.,"The salt spray dashes fierce, one, watching, cries,"
1340,BOOK IV.,"'Good mates, no storm I fear, for yonder rise"
1341,BOOK IV.,"The Elf-babes 'mid the foam. Ye goblin crew,"
1342,BOOK IV.,"That sail these unknown seas, we follow you"
1343,BOOK IV.,"To harbor safe. Ho, ho! With beckoning hands,"
1344,BOOK IV.,"Wind-driven, loud they cry--My mates! the lands,"
1345,BOOK IV.,"The golden lands we seek, are ours!'"
1346,BOOK IV.,
1347,BOOK IV.,"""In Earth's brown bosom pent, the hardy wight"
1348,BOOK IV.,Long in deep caverns dwells; and hard doth smite
1349,BOOK IV.,The rocky caves. Nor sees the golden spoil
1350,BOOK IV.,"Through weary days of wasted, lonely toil."
1351,BOOK IV.,"From his wild eyes, far-flying hides the prize,"
1352,BOOK IV.,"Till desperate, angered, worn, aloud he cries:"
1353,BOOK IV.,"'Vain, vain! The caves my labor answer not,"
1354,BOOK IV.,"Nor yellow threads, that gleam in any grot."
1355,BOOK IV.,"Hard, cruel, silent hills, my strength ye mock,"
1356,BOOK IV.,And seal your treasures close in flinty rock;
1357,BOOK IV.,"So, after toilsome years, sweet wife, I bring"
1358,BOOK IV.,"To thee no sparkling love-gift. Nay, nor anything"
1359,BOOK IV.,To cheer our failing time.'
1360,BOOK IV.,
1361,BOOK IV.,"""Then round him hears"
1362,BOOK IV.,"He sturdy blows, and listening, almost fears"
1363,BOOK IV.,"He dreams. But swift the echoes rise, and still"
1364,BOOK IV.,"More loudly roll, and quick replies the hill."
1365,BOOK IV.,"Reverberant, through all the caverns round,"
1366,BOOK IV.,"The uproar swells, and fills the world with sound."
1367,BOOK IV.,Then lists he once again. 'With lusty shocks
1368,BOOK IV.,Your hammers ring against the hard-ribbed rocks--
1369,BOOK IV.,"Goblins!' he boldly shouts, 'smite! smite! ye bring"
1370,BOOK IV.,"My treasure forth, dark-beating goblin wing"
1371,BOOK IV.,"Among the gleaming caves, whose dusk veins hold"
1372,BOOK IV.,"The gold. At last! At last, the ruddy gold!'"
1373,BOOK IV.,
1374,BOOK IV.,"""And lone, in stricken fields, the husbandman"
1375,BOOK IV.,"Sits pale, with anxious eyes that hopeless scan"
1376,BOOK IV.,The burning sky. Hot lie the glimmering plain
1377,BOOK IV.,"And uplands parched. 'Behold, the bending grain,"
1378,BOOK IV.,"Fair in the springtide, now is dead; and dry"
1379,BOOK IV.,"The brooks. If yet the rainfall fail, we die"
1380,BOOK IV.,Of famine sore. No bleating lambs I hear in fold
1381,BOOK IV.,"Safe shut, nor lowing kine; nor on the wold"
1382,BOOK IV.,The whir of mounting bird: Nor thrives about me
1383,BOOK IV.,"Any living thing. So seemeth, end must be"
1384,BOOK IV.,"Of striving. Since all the land is cursed,"
1385,BOOK IV.,"What matter if by famine scorched, or thirst,"
1386,BOOK IV.,We die?' he saith.
1387,BOOK IV.,"""And thick the warlock swarm"
1388,BOOK IV.,"Above his head, wide-spreading dark wings warm,"
1389,BOOK IV.,Fast flitted by. The waiting fields he stands
1390,BOOK IV.,"Among. And laughing, claps exultant hands."
1391,BOOK IV.,"'Good speed ye, Sprites! that bring the welcome cloud"
1392,BOOK IV.,"And pile the vapors thick,' he shouts aloud."
1393,BOOK IV.,"Oh! sweet shall bloom again the bending grain,"
1394,BOOK IV.,"And clothe afresh the wide, the wasted plain."
1395,BOOK IV.,"The clouds sweep black. Ha, ha! Against my cheek"
1396,BOOK IV.,The big drops fall. Merry the goblins shriek.
1397,BOOK IV.,"Behold, they mount, they sink, they rise again."
1398,BOOK IV.,"Ho, friendly elves, that bring the longed-for rain!'"""
1399,BOOK IV.,
1400,BOOK IV.,"Thereat, he, smiling, ceased. And when soft crept"
1401,BOOK IV.,"The listening stars across the sky, they slept"
1402,BOOK IV.,"Untroubled, 'neath the mango-trees."
1403,BOOK IV.,But when midway
1404,BOOK IV.,"The night was spent, Prince Eblis waking lay."
1405,BOOK IV.,Soft Lilith's breathing 'mong the droopt leaves stirred.
1406,BOOK IV.,"And he, sore troubled, mused on every word"
1407,BOOK IV.,That Lilith spake ere yet they slept. In all
1408,BOOK IV.,Foreseeing much of ill that might befall
1409,BOOK IV.,"Their love. ""O, queenly soul! Of finer grain"
1410,BOOK IV.,Thou art than angels are. And more in brain
1411,BOOK IV.,"Than man, I hold thee. Sooth, yet taints thee still"
1412,BOOK IV.,One touch of womankind. And since so chill
1413,BOOK IV.,"She finds her babes, must I forego my vow?"
1414,BOOK IV.,"For one flaw, Hope's clear crystal break? Oh, how"
1415,BOOK IV.,Ally her cause with mine! So doth she long
1416,BOOK IV.,For human love--a baby hand is strong
1417,BOOK IV.,To hurl my empire down. From her soft heart
1418,BOOK IV.,"Red, baby lips can drain revenge, and start"
1419,BOOK IV.,Unbidden tears. And pity wakes to life
1420,BOOK IV.,"When 'mong dead embers she sits lone, and strife"
1421,BOOK IV.,Is done.
1422,BOOK IV.,"""Then, at Regret's dull heels, lo, fast,"
1423,BOOK IV.,Retrieving follows. Happy days long past
1424,BOOK IV.,"She will recall. If so for love she yearn,"
1425,BOOK IV.,"Back to her early home once more will turn,"
1426,BOOK IV.,Pardoning her wilful lord. And he again
1427,BOOK IV.,"Shall win the woman I so love, and fain"
1428,BOOK IV.,"Would hold forever. Lilith, thou one balm"
1429,BOOK IV.,Of my lost soul in all this world! Shall calm
1430,BOOK IV.,"My sufferings, or love me, any one, save thee,"
1431,BOOK IV.,When thou in Adam's arms forgettest me?
1432,BOOK IV.,"My only love! Nay, then, 'twere surely wise"
1433,BOOK IV.,"To shut these baby faces from her eyes,"
1434,BOOK IV.,"New seeds of wrath to sow, her hate so feed"
1435,BOOK IV.,That all her rankling wounds afresh shall bleed.
1436,BOOK IV.,"And in her ears 'Good Adam!' will I cry,"
1437,BOOK IV.,Lest she forget Eden she lost thereby.
1438,BOOK IV.,"Yea, 'Adam!' I will laugh. Till her red lips with guile"
1439,BOOK IV.,O'erflow. And she shall curse him loud.  With subtlest wile
1440,BOOK IV.,"Safe won, then shall she ever be mine own."
1441,BOOK IV.,"Soul-bound to me in hate, more terrible than death"
1442,BOOK IV.,"In hate, that long outlasts Love's puny breath--"
1443,BOOK IV.,"O cunning craft, that with the self-same blow"
1444,BOOK IV.,"Forever wins my love, and smites my foe!"
1445,BOOK IV.,
1446,BOOK IV.,"""Last night, when Lilith slept, lest I might mar"
1447,BOOK IV.,"Her dreams, from our green couch I rose, and far"
1448,BOOK IV.,Passed silent. Know I not the spell that draws
1449,BOOK IV.,"My feet unwilling, Edenward. Its laws"
1450,BOOK IV.,I may not brave to rend my foe. Nor there
1451,BOOK IV.,"The Angel pass, unseen. The night so fair,"
1452,BOOK IV.,"As prone among the glistening leaves I lay,"
1453,BOOK IV.,"On Adam shone. Not sad, as on a day"
1454,BOOK IV.,Erstwhile he seemed. And I could almost swear
1455,BOOK IV.,The sound of silvery laughter on the air
1456,BOOK IV.,Fell soft. And a fleet footfall 'mong the flowers
1457,BOOK IV.,Scattered the dew. Yet 'mid those silent bowers
1458,BOOK IV.,Naught else I saw or heard save rippling flow
1459,BOOK IV.,"Of waters, and the moonshine white. Oh, low"
1460,BOOK IV.,"Speak, Eblis, lest aloud the night may tell"
1461,BOOK IV.,Thy secret to the stars. Yet it were well
1462,BOOK IV.,If lies the hidden cure for Lilith's woe
1463,BOOK IV.,Close shut in Paradise.
1464,BOOK IV.,"""All would we know,"
1465,BOOK IV.,"If we, close hid without those verdant walls,"
1466,BOOK IV.,Together watched. What fate soe'er befalls
1467,BOOK IV.,"I care not, if with me she bide."""
1468,BOOK IV.,Down bent
1469,BOOK IV.,"He o'er her hair, thick with the night-dew sprent."
1470,BOOK IV.,"Soft kissed it, crying, ""Love, the morn shines bright."
1471,BOOK IV.,"Waken, my Lilith, now. Through lands of night"
1472,BOOK IV.,Our happy course afar doth ever wend;
1473,BOOK IV.,"Past smiling shores where mighty rivers bend,"
1474,BOOK IV.,"Past cove and cape and isle, and winding bay"
1475,BOOK IV.,"And still blue mists, that hang athwart the day."""
1476,BOOK IV.,"Thereat she rose, and joyously they sped"
1477,BOOK IV.,By broad lagoons where musky odors shed
1478,BOOK IV.,"New blooms. About them coiled long wreaths of vine,"
1479,BOOK IV.,"And slim lianas drooped, and marish lichens fine."
1480,BOOK IV.,And fared they on o'er many a slanting beach
1481,BOOK IV.,And mountain crest; past many an open reach
1482,BOOK IV.,And forest wild--till over Paradise
1483,BOOK IV.,"They saw the stars, clear, tender, loving, rise."
1484,BOOK IV.,Then 'neath the screen of those rose-girdled walls
1485,BOOK IV.,"They hid without, listing the waterfalls,"
1486,BOOK IV.,"Or bird belated, twittering to its nest."
1487,BOOK IV.,"So still the spot, the very grass to rest"
1488,BOOK IV.,Seemed hushed.
1489,BOOK IV.,"The garden-close, a clinging rose o'ercrept."
1490,BOOK IV.,Its lustrous stem without that drooping swept
1491,BOOK IV.,Thick set with buds as tintless as the snows
1492,BOOK IV.,"On sunless hills, when wild the north wind blows."
1493,BOOK IV.,
1494,BOOK IV.,"Lilith a-tiptoe stood; upreaching, caught"
1495,BOOK IV.,The swaying boughs. Her eyes with longing fraught
1496,BOOK IV.,Close scanned her old deserted home. Then came
1497,BOOK IV.,"Upon her spirit sadness, as if blame"
1498,BOOK IV.,Unuttered breathed through those remembered glades
1499,BOOK IV.,And touched the odors moist 'mong mirky shades.
1500,BOOK IV.,"With wistful gaze, she traced each bosky dell,"
1501,BOOK IV.,Each winding path. And sweet youth's memories fell
1502,BOOK IV.,About her.
1503,BOOK IV.,"Then was she ware of Adam, slow"
1504,BOOK IV.,Pacing the pleasance-ways. With ruddy glow
1505,BOOK IV.,"Fresh shone his cheeks, and crisp his hair out-blown"
1506,BOOK IV.,By wanton winds. His lips were mirthful grown.
1507,BOOK IV.,Once he made pause hard by the coppice green
1508,BOOK IV.,That hid the watcher. Once the leafy screen
1509,BOOK IV.,"So near he passed, from the overhanging edge"
1510,BOOK IV.,He brushed a rose. The hindering hedge
1511,BOOK IV.,"Quick through, in sudden blessing slim white hand"
1512,BOOK IV.,"Fain had she reached. ""O Eden mine! Dear land,"""
1513,BOOK IV.,She sighed. And springing warm the tender tide
1514,BOOK IV.,Of teardrops gemmed the roses at her side.
1515,BOOK IV.,
1516,BOOK IV.,So greets the weary wanderer once more
1517,BOOK IV.,"His early home. The lintels worn, the door"
1518,BOOK IV.,"Age-stained; the iris clumps, in sheltered nook;"
1519,BOOK IV.,The mill-wheel rotting o'er the shrunken brook;
1520,BOOK IV.,"The sunny orchard, sloping west; and far"
1521,BOOK IV.,"And cold, above his mother's grave, a star--"
1522,BOOK IV.,"Then quick unbidden tears, the heart's warm rain,"
1523,BOOK IV.,"O'erflow his soul, and leave it pure again."
1524,BOOK IV.,"So Lilith backward turned to holier days,"
1525,BOOK IV.,Watching through misty tears where trod those ways
1526,BOOK IV.,Her feet in other times.
1527,BOOK IV.,Sudden and sweet
1528,BOOK IV.,Came down those paths a glimpse of flying feet;
1529,BOOK IV.,A sound of girlish laughter smote the air.
1530,BOOK IV.,"In jealous rage, Lilith uprose to dare"
1531,BOOK IV.,"The guarding Angel's wrath. But, silver clear,"
1532,BOOK IV.,The mocking laugh of Eblis caught her ear.
1533,BOOK IV.,"""Thou hast forgot,"" he said, ""this peaceful land,"
1534,BOOK IV.,"Living, thou canst not enter."""
1535,BOOK IV.,But her hand
1536,BOOK IV.,"Grasped once again the roses' shining strand,"
1537,BOOK IV.,"And 'neath her guileful touch, like scarlet flame"
1538,BOOK IV.,"The snowy flowers burned. So, first Earth's shame"
1539,BOOK IV.,Around them set the spikèd thorns.
1540,BOOK IV.,Long there
1541,BOOK IV.,"Pale Lilith looked, as coldly still and fair"
1542,BOOK IV.,"As carven stone. Then, with a fierce despair,"
1543,BOOK IV.,"A sense of utter loss, downbending there,"
1544,BOOK IV.,With fingers hot she tore the hedge apart
1545,BOOK IV.,And laid thereto her face. With sorer smart
1546,BOOK IV.,"She gazed again. For now, the twain at rest"
1547,BOOK IV.,"Were laid. Pure as a dream, Eve's sinless breast"
1548,BOOK IV.,"A babe close pressed. One pink foot, small and warm,"
1549,BOOK IV.,Among the leaves was hid. One dimpled arm
1550,BOOK IV.,Aneath her head.
1551,BOOK IV.,"Low Eblis sneered. ""I wot"
1552,BOOK IV.,In young Eve's arms my Lilith is forgot.
1553,BOOK IV.,"Oh, soon,"" he said, ""these earth-worms changeful turn--"
1554,BOOK IV.,"From the oped rose when red the shut buds burn."""
1555,BOOK IV.,"But wild eyes on the babe she fixed. ""Oh, blind,"""
1556,BOOK IV.,"She cried, ""was I. Yea, if the wanton wind"
1557,BOOK IV.,"Doth mock, I will not chide. Was it for this"
1558,BOOK IV.,"I wandered far, and bartered Eden's bliss?"
1559,BOOK IV.,For this have lost the very bloom of life?
1560,BOOK IV.,"So Adam comfort finds, not knowing strife!"
1561,BOOK IV.,"Look you, that fragile thing at Adam's side--"
1562,BOOK IV.,I heed her not. But Lilith is denied
1563,BOOK IV.,The treasure she so careless doth possess.
1564,BOOK IV.,"See how the babe, scarce waking, doth caress"
1565,BOOK IV.,"The mother! Look! Oh, hear the mother croon"
1566,BOOK IV.,"Above her child! Ah, Eblis, love, I swoon--"
1567,BOOK IV.,"I shall not know such joy. Alas, to me"
1568,BOOK IV.,"No babe shall come! Accurséd may she be,"
1569,BOOK IV.,Cursed Adam too. Thrice heavy on the head
1570,BOOK IV.,"Of this poor babe my wrong be visited."""
1571,BOOK IV.,"So, trembling, she brake off."
1572,BOOK IV.,"""Fast fades the light,"
1573,BOOK IV.,Sweet love. Once more to our dark realm of night
1574,BOOK IV.,"Let us return,"" he said."
1575,BOOK IV.,As on fared they
1576,BOOK IV.,"With merry jest, Eblis gan cheer the way."
1577,BOOK IV.,"""Nay, otherwhiles mirth pleased,"" she said. ""Knowest thou"
1578,BOOK IV.,"What name she bears, who dwells in Eden now?"
1579,BOOK IV.,"When Lilith went, long tarried Adam lone?"""
1580,BOOK IV.,"She said. Replied he, ""All to me is known"
1581,BOOK IV.,"Since that same hour you parted. What befell,"
1582,BOOK IV.,To thee as we wend onward I will tell.
1583,BOOK IV.,
1584,BOOK IV.,"""Calm morn in Eden streaked the skies with red,"
1585,BOOK IV.,And flushed the waiting hills above the grassy bed
1586,BOOK IV.,"Where Adam, joyless, saw new rise the sun,"
1587,BOOK IV.,Unwinding golden webs night-vapors spun
1588,BOOK IV.,"Athwart low meads. Slow, droning murmurs sent"
1589,BOOK IV.,"The waking bees, with bloom and fragrance blent."
1590,BOOK IV.,Unheeded poured her music blithesome Day
1591,BOOK IV.,The reedy brooks beside and shallows gray.
1592,BOOK IV.,"For lone to Adam seemed the place, and cold;"
1593,BOOK IV.,"The landscape dumb, as one aneath the mould."
1594,BOOK IV.,"For Lilith's sake, no more was Eden fair."
1595,BOOK IV.,"Bloomless the days, the nights bowed down with care."
1596,BOOK IV.,"Oft pacing pathways dim, he saw the gleam"
1597,BOOK IV.,"Of strange-faced flowers beside the purling stream,"
1598,BOOK IV.,"Or toyed with circling leaves; or plucked the grass,"
1599,BOOK IV.,And watched through rifted trees the clouds o'erpass;
1600,BOOK IV.,"Wide roaming, heard the waters idly break"
1601,BOOK IV.,Far 'gainst the curving beach.
1602,BOOK IV.,"""And grieving, spake,"
1603,BOOK IV.,"'Oh, sweet with thee each hour--each wilding way,"
1604,BOOK IV.,And sweet the memory of each gathered spray.
1605,BOOK IV.,"Could you not wait, dear love? Or come once more?"
1606,BOOK IV.,"Yea, 'till you come, vain doth great Nature pour"
1607,BOOK IV.,"Her richest gifts.' He paused, and heard alone"
1608,BOOK IV.,"Respondent fall, the wood-dove's plaintive moan,"
1609,BOOK IV.,And the spent winds among the scented glades.
1610,BOOK IV.,"Moss-couched beneath the glinting forest shades,"
1611,BOOK IV.,"He gazed, when shadows o'er the hills crept light,"
1612,BOOK IV.,"Quick vanishing, like phantom fingers white,"
1613,BOOK IV.,"Until on mead, and mere, and sounding shore"
1614,BOOK IV.,"Eden found voice, sad plaining, 'Never-more!'"
1615,BOOK IV.,Long time he pondered on blue peaks remote
1616,BOOK IV.,"When slow, as stranded ships that listless float,"
1617,BOOK IV.,Moved by the sunset clouds. Or the white rack
1618,BOOK IV.,Swept o'er the garden walls.
1619,BOOK IV.,"""'Would I their track"
1620,BOOK IV.,"Might take,' he said, 'Lilith, so long you stay."
1621,BOOK IV.,Whom my soul follows sorrowing--alway.'
1622,BOOK IV.,"Thus ever mourned he, comfortless; that so"
1623,BOOK IV.,"In after days the Master, in the glow"
1624,BOOK IV.,"Of morning-tide, the mother of the race"
1625,BOOK IV.,Gave for his solacement.
1626,BOOK IV.,"""Oh, fair the face"
1627,BOOK IV.,Young Eve bent o'er his sleep. Ere down the glade
1628,BOOK IV.,"The startled fawn leaps swift, her glance dismayed"
1629,BOOK IV.,"Questions the hunter, mute. Such eyes--so brown,"
1630,BOOK IV.,"So soft, so winning, shy--that looked adown"
1631,BOOK IV.,"When Adam waked. Like vagrant tendrils, tossed"
1632,BOOK IV.,Dark hair about her brows. And quaintly crossed
1633,BOOK IV.,Her hands upon her breast. Less red the dart
1634,BOOK IV.,"That deepest cleaves the folded rose's heart,"
1635,BOOK IV.,Than her round cheeks. Not hers the regal air
1636,BOOK IV.,"Of Lilith lost, the white arms, lissom, bare,"
1637,BOOK IV.,"The slender throat; the elbows dimpled deep, whereto"
1638,BOOK IV.,Might scarcely reach Eve's head.
1639,BOOK IV.,"""Yet soft, as through"
1640,BOOK IV.,"Some pleasant dream, the summer's spicy air"
1641,BOOK IV.,"Stirs odorous 'mong seaward gardens fair,"
1642,BOOK IV.,"In southland hid; so, gently, Eve straightway"
1643,BOOK IV.,"To Adam's life unbidden came, to stay"
1644,BOOK IV.,Forever there. Sure entrance then made she
1645,BOOK IV.,Into that heart untenanted by thee.
1646,BOOK IV.,"""So, to some olden house, from whose shut doors"
1647,BOOK IV.,"One went erewhile, another comes. Its floors"
1648,BOOK IV.,"All empty sees. The lowly threshold worn,"
1649,BOOK IV.,"The moss-grown roof, the casements left forlorn."
1650,BOOK IV.,"Amid the shadows round about him stands,"
1651,BOOK IV.,"Missing the footsteps passed to other lands,"
1652,BOOK IV.,"And whispers tenderly, 'Since here no more"
1653,BOOK IV.,"The owner bides, what harm if on the floor"
1654,BOOK IV.,I pass? Good chance it were the clambering vine
1655,BOOK IV.,About the porch with fingers deft to twine--
1656,BOOK IV.,"To draw the curtains, ope the door. For who"
1657,BOOK IV.,"May know how soon these paths untended, through,"
1658,BOOK IV.,"He comes again, with weary, way-worn feet,"
1659,BOOK IV.,"Who made aforetime, other days so sweet."
1660,BOOK IV.,"Wherefore, I enter now. For whose dear sake"
1661,BOOK IV.,"These vacant rooms, white, fragrant, clean, I make."
1662,BOOK IV.,"And when, world-wearied, he returns, we twain"
1663,BOOK IV.,Perchance together bide. Nor part again.'
1664,BOOK IV.,"So Eve found refuge. Tender love, the spell"
1665,BOOK IV.,Whereby she ruled. Peaceful the pair did dwell.
1666,BOOK IV.,"Fast fled the happy years, till softly laid"
1667,BOOK IV.,"In her glad arms the babe--a winsome maid."""
1668,BOOK IV.,He ended there. Between them silence deep
1669,BOOK IV.,"Fell, as they journeyed. And the furthest steep"
1670,BOOK IV.,"They crossed, that o'er their shadow-world rose high."
1671,BOOK IV.,"Then saw they level plains, their home, anigh."
1672,BOOK IV.,"And now, seeking her pleasance once again,"
1673,BOOK IV.,They came to their own land. But all in vain
1674,BOOK IV.,"His care. Silent she was, and oft did grieve,"
1675,BOOK IV.,"Till Eblis wrathful cried: ""Because this Eve"
1676,BOOK IV.,"Adam holds dear, art mourning? Still dost yearn"
1677,BOOK IV.,To mate his sordid soul? Or wouldst thou turn
1678,BOOK IV.,From summer land to Eden walls?
1679,BOOK IV.,"""The man"
1680,BOOK IV.,"Belike, ne'er loved thee. So is it young Eve can"
1681,BOOK IV.,His pulses sway. Is she not passing fair?
1682,BOOK IV.,"Her fancies wild, it is her daily care"
1683,BOOK IV.,To bend beneath his ever fickle will.
1684,BOOK IV.,"Red-lipped and soft, she deftly rules him still,"
1685,BOOK IV.,Though he wist not. Yet sweeter Lilith's frown
1686,BOOK IV.,Than archest smile she wears. Great Soul! The crown
1687,BOOK IV.,Thou bearest of fadeless life. For fleeting dreams
1688,BOOK IV.,"In Paradise, beside the winding streams,"
1689,BOOK IV.,"Wilt thou resign such boon? Thou art, in sooth,"
1690,BOOK IV.,Of mold too firm for Adam's love. In truth
1691,BOOK IV.,A prince--though fallen--consorts best with thee
1692,BOOK IV.,"Say which were wise, with Eden's lord to be,"
1693,BOOK IV.,"Or, shining high, the purer soul, the star"
1694,BOOK IV.,"That fadeless burns, and Eblis lights afar?"
1695,BOOK IV.,Were it not grand through endless spaces hurled
1696,BOOK IV.,"With me to drive, above a shrinking world"
1697,BOOK IV.,"Our chariot, wide?"
1698,BOOK IV.,"""For I foresee when dawn"
1699,BOOK IV.,"Dark days upon our foes, and hope is gone."
1700,BOOK IV.,"Wherefore, my Lilith, now, as seems thee good,"
1701,BOOK IV.,"Make choice."" Thereat she, turning where she stood,"
1702,BOOK IV.,"With kisses hung about his neck, and smiled,"
1703,BOOK IV.,"Crying, ""Thine, Eblis, thine!"" So were they reconciled."
1704,BOOK IV.,
1705,BOOK IV.,
1706,BOOK IV.,
1707,BOOK IV.,
1708,BOOK V.,BOOK V.
1709,BOOK V.,
1710,BOOK V.,
1711,BOOK V.,"And Lilith oft to Paradise returned,"
1712,BOOK V.,"For fierce within her, bitter hatred burned,"
1713,BOOK V.,"And better, dearer, seemed revenge than aught"
1714,BOOK V.,"She else desired. The coppice oft she sought,"
1715,BOOK V.,Much hoping direful evil might be wrought
1716,BOOK V.,Upon the love that bloomed in Eden.
1717,BOOK V.,Wide
1718,BOOK V.,"Oft strayed fair Eve; the little maid, beside,"
1719,BOOK V.,"Plucking the lotus; or by sedgy moats,"
1720,BOOK V.,"From ribbed papyrus broad, frail fairy boats"
1721,BOOK V.,"Deft fashioning. Or Adam, watching, smiled,"
1722,BOOK V.,With flowery wreaths engarlanding the child.
1723,BOOK V.,"And laughed the pair, intent on pleasant toil,"
1724,BOOK V.,When blithe the child upheaped her fruity spoil--
1725,BOOK V.,Great globes of red and gold. Or roguish face
1726,BOOK V.,"O'er feathery broods, or in the further space"
1727,BOOK V.,"To count the small blue eggs, she sportive bent;"
1728,BOOK V.,And far her restless feet swift glancing went.
1729,BOOK V.,It chanced one day she watched the careless flight
1730,BOOK V.,"Of vagrant butterflies, that circled light"
1731,BOOK V.,"Uncertain, high, above a copse rose-wreathed;"
1732,BOOK V.,"Then soft down-dropping, gaudy wings they sheathed"
1733,BOOK V.,Beside a darkling pool. The copse anear
1734,BOOK V.,With yellow buds was strewn. And softly here
1735,BOOK V.,"She crept, deeming her little half-shut hand"
1736,BOOK V.,Might snare the fairest of that gleaming band.
1737,BOOK V.,"Yet ere she touched it, wide its wings outspread"
1738,BOOK V.,In flight.
1739,BOOK V.,
1740,BOOK V.,"And still she, swift pursuing, sped"
1741,BOOK V.,"Among the groves, till wearied, slept the maid"
1742,BOOK V.,"Deep in the mid-day shadows, lowly laid."
1743,BOOK V.,
1744,BOOK V.,"Without, stooped Lilith. And with fingers swift,"
1745,BOOK V.,"Among the leaves she oped a small green rift,"
1746,BOOK V.,That she might see the child. The hedge was wet
1747,BOOK V.,With starry blooms. Whereto her hand she set
1748,BOOK V.,"When she awaked, seeing each dainty frond"
1749,BOOK V.,"Of fragrant ferns, dusk mirrored in the pond."
1750,BOOK V.,"The child came near the copse, much wondering:"
1751,BOOK V.,From glossy stems the smooth leaves sundering.
1752,BOOK V.,"And stooping o'er the rift, she saw there, low"
1753,BOOK V.,"Against the hedge, a face like drifted snow,"
1754,BOOK V.,"And soft eyes, blue as violets show"
1755,BOOK V.,Above the brooks; and hair that downward rolled
1756,BOOK V.,Upon the ground in glittering strands of gold.
1757,BOOK V.,"Mute stood the maid, naught fearing, but amazed."
1758,BOOK V.,"Then nearer drew, and lingering, she gazed"
1759,BOOK V.,"In those blue orbs. And smiling as she knelt,"
1760,BOOK V.,The stranger quickly loosed her shining belt
1761,BOOK V.,Of gems. Flawless each stone whose pallid gleam
1762,BOOK V.,"Lit silent nooks, or slept by far-off stream"
1763,BOOK V.,"Unheeded--pale pearls with shimmering light,"
1764,BOOK V.,"From distant oceans plucked, blue sapphires bright,"
1765,BOOK V.,"And diamonds rosy-cold, and burning red"
1766,BOOK V.,"The rubies fine, and yellow topaz shed"
1767,BOOK V.,"Its sultry glow, jasper, dull onyx white,"
1768,BOOK V.,"Sardonyx, rare chalcèdon, streaked with light."
1769,BOOK V.,"Against her white breast that bright zone she laid,"
1770,BOOK V.,"Then stretched it, flashing forth, toward the maid,"
1771,BOOK V.,And clasped it round her throat.
1772,BOOK V.,A luring strain
1773,BOOK V.,"She sung, sweet as the pause of summer rain."
1774,BOOK V.,"So soft, so pure her voice, the child it drew"
1775,BOOK V.,Still nearer that green rift; and low there-through
1776,BOOK V.,She laughing stroked the down-bent golden head
1777,BOOK V.,"With her soft baby hands. And parting, spread"
1778,BOOK V.,"The silken hair about her little face,"
1779,BOOK V.,And kissed the temptress through the green-leaved space.
1780,BOOK V.,"Whereat fell Lilith snatched the babe and fled,"
1781,BOOK V.,"Crying, as swift from Eden's bounds she sped,"
1782,BOOK V.,And like a fallen star shone on her breast
1783,BOOK V.,"The child, ""At last! at last! thy peaceful rest"
1784,BOOK V.,"Ere long will cease. O helpless mourn, frail Eve,"
1785,BOOK V.,"Uncomforted. O hapless mother, grieve,"
1786,BOOK V.,Since Lilith far from thee thy babe doth bear!
1787,BOOK V.,"She leaves thy loving arms, thy tender care."
1788,BOOK V.,"Nor canst thou follow anywhere my flight,"
1789,BOOK V.,When far we go athwart the falling night.
1790,BOOK V.,"Ah, little babe, close-meshed in yellow hair"
1791,BOOK V.,"Thou liest pale! Fear not, thou art so fair,"
1792,BOOK V.,"Much comfort lives in thee."""
1793,BOOK V.,"So ended she,"
1794,BOOK V.,"And onward, hostile lands among, passed fleet"
1795,BOOK V.,"Blue solitudes afar, till paused her feet,"
1796,BOOK V.,"Where highest 'mong hoar climbing peaks, uprose"
1797,BOOK V.,A mountain crest.
1798,BOOK V.,It was the third day's close.
1799,BOOK V.,"In those untrodden ways there was no sound,"
1800,BOOK V.,"No sight of living thing, the barren heights around."
1801,BOOK V.,"No hum of insect life, no whirring wing of bird."
1802,BOOK V.,"Bare rocks alone, all fissured, blotched and blurred"
1803,BOOK V.,As with red stain of battle-fields unseen.
1804,BOOK V.,"Far, far below, still vales were shining green."
1805,BOOK V.,"And leaping downward swift, a mountain stream"
1806,BOOK V.,"Crept soft to sleep, where meadow grasses dream."
1807,BOOK V.,"Wan, wayworn, there, the babe upon her knee,"
1808,BOOK V.,"Lilith sat down. ""O Eve,"" she said, ""on me"
1809,BOOK V.,The child smiles sweet! Fondle her silken hair
1810,BOOK V.,"If now thou canst, or clasp her small hands fair."
1811,BOOK V.,"Thou hast my Paradise. Lo, thine I bear"
1812,BOOK V.,"Afar from thee. See, then! Its transient woe"
1813,BOOK V.,Thy babe e'en now forgets; and sweet and low
1814,BOOK V.,"It babbles on my knee. In sooth, not long"
1815,BOOK V.,"Endure her griefs, and through my crooning song"
1816,BOOK V.,"She kisses me, recalling not the place"
1817,BOOK V.,"Whence she has come. Nay, nor her mother's face."""
1818,BOOK V.,Long time stayed Lilith in that land. More calm
1819,BOOK V.,"Each day she grew, for soft, like healing balm,"
1820,BOOK V.,The child's pure love fell on her sin-sick soul.
1821,BOOK V.,"Now oft among the crags, fleet-footed, stole"
1822,BOOK V.,"The maid, or lightly crossed the fertile plain."
1823,BOOK V.,And blithesome sang among the growing grain
1824,BOOK V.,That brake in billowy waves about her feet.
1825,BOOK V.,"But when the wheat full ripened was, and sweet,"
1826,BOOK V.,"She plucked and ate. Thereat a shadowy pain,"
1827,BOOK V.,"A sense of sorrow, stirred that childish brain,"
1828,BOOK V.,She wist not why. For it did surely seem
1829,BOOK V.,"Before her waking thought, with pallid gleam"
1830,BOOK V.,"Of other days, dim pictures passed; of wood"
1831,BOOK V.,"And stream, beyond these mountain rims. And stood,"
1832,BOOK V.,"It seemed, midway a garden wide, a tree that bright"
1833,BOOK V.,"Like silver gleamed, and broad boughs light"
1834,BOOK V.,"Uplifted. Like ripened wheat the fruit thereon,"
1835,BOOK V.,When low the westering sun upon it shone.
1836,BOOK V.,"Then slow the maid did turn, and silent stand"
1837,BOOK V.,"At Lilith's side. And o'er that mountain land,"
1838,BOOK V.,"Down-looking, mused. Or lifted pensive eyes,"
1839,BOOK V.,And gaze that questioned if in any wise
1840,BOOK V.,She might perceive the land she longing sought;
1841,BOOK V.,"But of its stream, or garden, saw she naught."
1842,BOOK V.,"Thereat Lilith with white lips drew more near,"
1843,BOOK V.,And clasped in her lithe arms the child so dear.
1844,BOOK V.,"And once again fled swift, a shadowy shape,"
1845,BOOK V.,"Across green fields.  And heard, through silence, break"
1846,BOOK V.,"A voice she could not hush, that loudly wailed,"
1847,BOOK V.,"""My babe! Give me my babe!"""
1848,BOOK V.,"And Lilith paled,"
1849,BOOK V.,"And listening, heard, borne ever on the wind,"
1850,BOOK V.,The tread of feet fast following behind.
1851,BOOK V.,"Then westward turned, where once among new ways"
1852,BOOK V.,"With Eblis she had trod in other days,"
1853,BOOK V.,When far they wandered. Thitherward she bent
1854,BOOK V.,"Her timid steps, the babe upon her breast,"
1855,BOOK V.,Until with travel worn her noontide rest
1856,BOOK V.,She took. And now a land of alien blooms
1857,BOOK V.,"About them lay, outwafting strange perfumes."
1858,BOOK V.,"And quaint defiles, that sloped behind a bay;"
1859,BOOK V.,And level fields; and curly vines that lay
1860,BOOK V.,Thick clustered o'er with unripe fruit; and bent
1861,BOOK V.,Above them fragrant limes and spicy scent
1862,BOOK V.,Of citron and of myrtle all the place
1863,BOOK V.,"Made sweet, and 'mid the trees, an open space"
1864,BOOK V.,They saw.
1865,BOOK V.,Not far away a broad lagoon
1866,BOOK V.,"Burned like a topaz 'neath a crescent moon,"
1867,BOOK V.,For day was parting. Even-tide apace
1868,BOOK V.,"Drew on, and chill the night dews filled the place."
1869,BOOK V.,"Upon the waters dusky shadows clung,"
1870,BOOK V.,And ashen-gray the broad leaves drooping hung;
1871,BOOK V.,Low 'mong the marish buds lay one that made
1872,BOOK V.,Against the sudden dusk a duskier shade--
1873,BOOK V.,"Despairing arms upflinging to the sky,"
1874,BOOK V.,Smiting the silence with unheeded cry--
1875,BOOK V.,"""O mother, childless! Wife--of all bereft!"
1876,BOOK V.,"Alas, my babe, not even thou art left"
1877,BOOK V.,"To comfort me, in these last hopeless days,"
1878,BOOK V.,Shut out from Paradise. Through unknown ways
1879,BOOK V.,"I sought thee sorrowing. Oh, once again,"
1880,BOOK V.,"My Adam, come! Is not this gnawing pain"
1881,BOOK V.,"Of punishment enow, that thou unkind"
1882,BOOK V.,"Art grown? Ah, never more shall I thee find?"
1883,BOOK V.,"Alas, I ever was but weak. Alone"
1884,BOOK V.,"I cannot live. Come but again, mine own."
1885,BOOK V.,"No longer leave me mourning, desolate."
1886,BOOK V.,"In tears I call thee. Oh, in tears I wait"
1887,BOOK V.,"Thy sweet, forgiving kiss!"""
1888,BOOK V.,Ended she so
1889,BOOK V.,"Her plaint. And 'mong the glistening leaves hid low,"
1890,BOOK V.,Lilith yet fiercer clasped the child
1891,BOOK V.,"When that lorn mother, tear-stained, weeping, wild,"
1892,BOOK V.,Poured forth her woe.
1893,BOOK V.,As one that wakes to life
1894,BOOK V.,"From peaceful dreams, leaps quick amid the strife"
1895,BOOK V.,"Of morning hours, so now the maid to pass"
1896,BOOK V.,"From Lilith's arms strove hard. And loosed her clasp,"
1897,BOOK V.,And turned her shadowed face with plaintive moan
1898,BOOK V.,"And fond beseeching eyes, where lay her mother lone."
1899,BOOK V.,"But Lilith hardening, seized the child again,"
1900,BOOK V.,And from her ears shut out the mother's pain
1901,BOOK V.,With wilful hands.
1902,BOOK V.,So passed she quick away.
1903,BOOK V.,"Across the dusky path, low fallen, lay"
1904,BOOK V.,"Pale Eve, till clear she saw the dawn's pure ray,"
1905,BOOK V.,"And as she looked, the voice of one she heard"
1906,BOOK V.,Anigh. Her heart to sudden joy was stirred.
1907,BOOK V.,"""Rise up, mine own,"" he said, ""no more apart"
1908,BOOK V.,"We walk."" Then she arose, and cried, ""Dear heart,"
1909,BOOK V.,Close hold me. So! Methinks I dreamed we were
1910,BOOK V.,"Parted long time."""
1911,BOOK V.,"So went, the exiled pair"
1912,BOOK V.,"From home thrust out, together--everywhere."
1913,BOOK V.,And oft they journeyed on with sufferings spent
1914,BOOK V.,To distant lands. And oft with labor bent
1915,BOOK V.,"Recalled the olden home, with brimming eyes,"
1916,BOOK V.,Hemmed in by mountains blue--lost Paradise.
1917,BOOK V.,
1918,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile, to her own realm Lilith long since"
1919,BOOK V.,"Was come, glad greeting Eblis. ""O my prince,"
1920,BOOK V.,I have most bravely done. Our foes full sore
1921,BOOK V.,Are smitten now. My guerdon o'er and o'er
1922,BOOK V.,"Thou wilt bestow, I ween, in kisses warm"
1923,BOOK V.,As my own southland's breath. For I great harm
1924,BOOK V.,Have wrought that hated pair. With feeble moan
1925,BOOK V.,"Lies Eve in a far land, thrust out. Alone,"
1926,BOOK V.,Deserted. And whence angered Adam flies
1927,BOOK V.,"I know not. Nay, nor what new world his eyes"
1928,BOOK V.,Behold. Nor even if he live.
1929,BOOK V.,"""But see!"
1930,BOOK V.,Sleeps on my breast the babe--Eve's babe. And she
1931,BOOK V.,"Shall know no more its tender, sweet caress,"
1932,BOOK V.,Soft medicining woe. The wilderness
1933,BOOK V.,"Uncheered by love, is hers."""
1934,BOOK V.,"And by the sea,"
1935,BOOK V.,"Peaceful abode, long time content, the three,"
1936,BOOK V.,Save that the child unmurmuring drooped.
1937,BOOK V.,"Then oft above her Lilith, singing, stooped,"
1938,BOOK V.,Striving to wake the baby smiles again
1939,BOOK V.,"About her wee, warm mouth. Vain wiles! And vain"
1940,BOOK V.,"Her loving skill. All still she lay, and pale."
1941,BOOK V.,As one at sea pines for a lonely vale
1942,BOOK V.,Besprent with cuckoo flowers; the faint wild breath
1943,BOOK V.,"Of cradled buds, among the cloven elms, and saith,"
1944,BOOK V.,"'I shall not see that place beyond the seas,"
1945,BOOK V.,Nor any more pluck red anemones
1946,BOOK V.,In windless nooks.'
1947,BOOK V.,"So seemed the child, and frail"
1948,BOOK V.,As one that weeps above dead joys. Then pale
1949,BOOK V.,Grew Lilith as those wasting lips she pressed
1950,BOOK V.,"And kissed the filmy eyes, and kissing, blessed"
1951,BOOK V.,The child.
1952,BOOK V.,"But Eblis touched the hand so worn,"
1953,BOOK V.,"The faded, wasted face. ""Happy, thou mother lorn,"
1954,BOOK V.,"Unseeing her,"" he said. ""This fragile thing"
1955,BOOK V.,To-day lies on thy breast. To-morrow's wing
1956,BOOK V.,"Hath brushed it from thy sight."" Low Lilith sighed:"
1957,BOOK V.,"""My Eblis, is this death?"" And louder cried,"
1958,BOOK V.,"""But thou art wise, and sure some hidden way"
1959,BOOK V.,"From this sore hap canst find. O Eblis, say,"
1960,BOOK V.,Hast thou no spell whereby the child may live?
1961,BOOK V.,"O love, my realm thy recompense I give,"
1962,BOOK V.,"If she be healed."""
1963,BOOK V.,"""Nay; not Archangel's craft"
1964,BOOK V.,"Stays fleeting life, or turns Death's nimble shaft,"""
1965,BOOK V.,"He said. ""Yet if,"" she mused, ""I laid again"
1966,BOOK V.,"The child in young Eve's arms, like summer rain,"
1967,BOOK V.,The mother's love may yet restore again
1968,BOOK V.,"This shriveled life. And yet, must I resign"
1969,BOOK V.,"The babe? Alas, my little one! Nay, mine"
1970,BOOK V.,"No more!"" Weeping she ceased."
1971,BOOK V.,"But after, bore"
1972,BOOK V.,The child far northward; the exiled pair o'er
1973,BOOK V.,Many lands long seeking. Till from a crest
1974,BOOK V.,"Of barren hills Lilith looked down. At rest,"
1975,BOOK V.,"The twain she saw, for it was eventide."
1976,BOOK V.,And low they spoke of hidden snares beside
1977,BOOK V.,"Their unknown path, since unaware fared they"
1978,BOOK V.,Into this hostile spot. The dim wolds lay
1979,BOOK V.,All bare beneath chill stars. And far away
1980,BOOK V.,"Were belts of pine, and dingy ocean shore,"
1981,BOOK V.,"Like wrinkled lip. Cold was the land, and hoar"
1982,BOOK V.,"With wintry rime.  Near by, its leafless boughs"
1983,BOOK V.,"A thorn bush bent, with withered berries red."
1984,BOOK V.,"At sight thereof Adam, rejoicing, said,"
1985,BOOK V.,"""My Eve, bide here. From yonder friendly tree"
1986,BOOK V.,"The ripe fruit I will pluck and bring to thee."""
1987,BOOK V.,"""Oh, leave me not! This solitude I fear;"
1988,BOOK V.,"The land about is chill,"" she said, ""and drear"
1989,BOOK V.,"It seems to me."" But Adam answered, ""Nay,"
1990,BOOK V.,"Sore famished art thou, and not far away"
1991,BOOK V.,"It is--nor long I stay."""
1992,BOOK V.,So parted he.
1993,BOOK V.,Not long alone was Eve. Upstarted she
1994,BOOK V.,"Dismayed. A woman, most exceeding fair,"
1995,BOOK V.,"Beside her stood, with coils of yellow hair,"
1996,BOOK V.,"And blue eyes, calm as sleep among the hills'"
1997,BOOK V.,"Dim lakes. Eve, frighted, shrank. As mountain rills,"
1998,BOOK V.,"Sweet fell the stranger's words. ""My sister, one"
1999,BOOK V.,Is here that glad salutes thee. And since done
2000,BOOK V.,"Is now my quest, and here my journey ends,"
2001,BOOK V.,I bring a goodly gift. For elsewhere wends
2002,BOOK V.,"My pathway, Eve."
2003,BOOK V.,"""Beside a coppice green,"
2004,BOOK V.,"Brighter than gold, purer than silver sheen,"
2005,BOOK V.,"In a fair garden, once a jewel shone."
2006,BOOK V.,"With it, compared in all the world, no stone."
2007,BOOK V.,And low the Master set it shining clear
2008,BOOK V.,"Against the hedge, saying, 'When she draws near"
2009,BOOK V.,She will perceive on whom I do bestow
2010,BOOK V.,"This moteless gem, that fellow doth not know.'"
2011,BOOK V.,"""Now I without the copse that day was hid."
2012,BOOK V.,"Soft shone the jewel, as the moon amid"
2013,BOOK V.,"The blue. And in the garden I saw thee,"
2014,BOOK V.,Where in the midst stood a fair wheaten tree
2015,BOOK V.,"As emerald green. Its ears, as rubies red,"
2016,BOOK V.,"Fragrant as breath of musk, its odors spread."
2017,BOOK V.,And white its shining grains as rifted snow.
2018,BOOK V.,"I looked again. And in thy fair hand, lo,"
2019,BOOK V.,Full ripe bright gleamed the yellow wheaten grain.
2020,BOOK V.,"Thou saidst, 'Though I did eat, I live.  No pain"
2021,BOOK V.,Hath marred this pleasant feast.'
2022,BOOK V.,"""Then I the more"
2023,BOOK V.,Desired thy gem. 'All things most goodly pour
2024,BOOK V.,"On Eve their gifts. But I am famished lone,'"
2025,BOOK V.,I said. And still against the hedge the stone
2026,BOOK V.,Rayed like a frozen tear the pure Night shed--
2027,BOOK V.,"The which with trembling hand I seized, and fled"
2028,BOOK V.,Afar.
2029,BOOK V.,"""But now upon my soul weighs sore"
2030,BOOK V.,"A dream. A voice called loud, 'Straightway restore"
2031,BOOK V.,"To Eve that which is hers; lest I, that bright"
2032,BOOK V.,"Set it against the hedge, will quench its light."
2033,BOOK V.,"Yea, I will crumble it and quickly smite"
2034,BOOK V.,It into dust e'en from thy hand.' Mine eyes
2035,BOOK V.,I careless closed. But yesternight 'Arise!'
2036,BOOK V.,"The stern voice cried. 'Stay not at all. For lo,"
2037,BOOK V.,"I wait not. Lest I scourge thee sorely, go!'"
2038,BOOK V.,"Ah, Eve, though long upon my heart I wore"
2039,BOOK V.,"This jewel rare, behold, I now restore"
2040,BOOK V.,"Thine own!"""
2041,BOOK V.,"Then Eve cried loud, ""Ere my heart break,"
2042,BOOK V.,"Give me my babe!  Where is she, for whose sake"
2043,BOOK V.,"I sorrowed all these years--the little maid?"""
2044,BOOK V.,"She said, through tender sobs."
2045,BOOK V.,And Lilith laid
2046,BOOK V.,"Apart upon her breast her garment, dyed"
2047,BOOK V.,"In blended hues. And stooping at Eve's side,"
2048,BOOK V.,Gave back the child.
2049,BOOK V.,As one that ending quest
2050,BOOK V.,"Most perilous, safe harbor sees--at rest"
2051,BOOK V.,"Among green hills--and enters glad therein,"
2052,BOOK V.,So Lilith was.
2053,BOOK V.,So passed she once again
2054,BOOK V.,Into her land.
2055,BOOK V.,"But Eve, like rain"
2056,BOOK V.,"Long pent, upon the child poured swiftly down"
2057,BOOK V.,"Sweet kisses. And again, twixt laugh and frown"
2058,BOOK V.,"Divided, smoothed the baby face, and through"
2059,BOOK V.,"Her fingers soft the silken hair she drew,"
2060,BOOK V.,And kissed again.
2061,BOOK V.,And with a vague surprise
2062,BOOK V.,"Recalled the stranger's smile, the mournful eyes,"
2063,BOOK V.,"Much marveling whence she fared. And said, ""As pale"
2064,BOOK V.,"She seemed as bramble-blooms in Eden's vale."""
2065,BOOK V.,
2066,BOOK V.,"When homeward Adam came, the child she set"
2067,BOOK V.,"Upon his knee, saying, ""Erewhile I met"
2068,BOOK V.,"An angel. So to me she seemed, as there"
2069,BOOK V.,"She stood. So tall, so yellow-haired, so fair;"
2070,BOOK V.,"And lo, she brought again the babe."""
2071,BOOK V.,Therewith
2072,BOOK V.,"She ended low. ""Doubtless an angel, love, sith"
2073,BOOK V.,"So you deem her,"" he replied. And mused on all"
2074,BOOK V.,Eve told.
2075,BOOK V.,"And watching, saw a shadow fall"
2076,BOOK V.,"Upon the child. And later, did recall"
2077,BOOK V.,"Those words, sad pondering ""so fair, so tall."""
2078,BOOK V.,But nothing uttered.
2079,BOOK V.,
2080,BOOK V.,In that land long time
2081,BOOK V.,"They lingered. And the child slow faded, till"
2082,BOOK V.,"One day Eve frighted cried, ""See, Adam, still"
2083,BOOK V.,"She lies! Ah, little one, unseal those eyes!"
2084,BOOK V.,"Rouse but awhile, ere waning daylight flies!"""
2085,BOOK V.,"For she discerned not yet its doom, nor knew"
2086,BOOK V.,The hour was near.
2087,BOOK V.,"But Adam, parting, drew"
2088,BOOK V.,"Beneath the thorn, lest he might see the child."
2089,BOOK V.,"And all the lone hours through Eve, babbling, smiled"
2090,BOOK V.,Adown. And blew her warm breath o'er the cheeks
2091,BOOK V.,"So wan. ""The night grows cold,"" she said. ""Sleep creeps"
2092,BOOK V.,"Dull on my babe. The night grows cold and chill,"""
2093,BOOK V.,She said.
2094,BOOK V.,"Nor dreamed aneath those lids closed still,"
2095,BOOK V.,The death film hung.
2096,BOOK V.,"A wind uprose, and swept"
2097,BOOK V.,"Among the dry leaves heaped, where lowly slept"
2098,BOOK V.,"The child. Cold grew the night and colder, till"
2099,BOOK V.,"Against the east the dawn glowed daffodil,"
2100,BOOK V.,Above dun wolds white with new-fallen snow.
2101,BOOK V.,So rose the day and widened into morning glow
2102,BOOK V.,"With rosy tints o'erstreaked, and faintly blurred"
2103,BOOK V.,With flecks of cloud.
2104,BOOK V.,"Still lay the child, nor stirred."
2105,BOOK V.,"Dumb Eve looked down, nor knew Death's pallid masque,"
2106,BOOK V.,And strove to wake the maid. In vain. Her task
2107,BOOK V.,"Was done. And as she gazed, a gentle grasp"
2108,BOOK V.,"Soft loosed the dead from that cold mother's clasp,"
2109,BOOK V.,And Lilith laid the babe in its chill bed--
2110,BOOK V.,"Straightened the limbs, and kissed the little head."
2111,BOOK V.,"And o'er the sleeper, kneeling, she did lean."
2112,BOOK V.,"Forth from her breast she drew, close folded, green,"
2113,BOOK V.,"A sheath of leaves, bright shining, lustrous--wet"
2114,BOOK V.,With tears--that in those waxen hands she set.
2115,BOOK V.,Then those shut leaves oped slow. And low and frail
2116,BOOK V.,Bloomed 'mid the tintless snows a snow-drop pale.
2117,BOOK V.,"Soft Lilith said, ""For this pale sleeper's sake,"
2118,BOOK V.,"O Eve, one kiss bestow. E'en thou canst take"
2119,BOOK V.,"Pity on me. For thee new, happy days await,"
2120,BOOK V.,But I--I am forever desolate.
2121,BOOK V.,For thee fresh love will bloom above this mould;
2122,BOOK V.,"For thee, in coming years, pure lips unfold;"
2123,BOOK V.,"But I--no more, no more, shall feel the warm"
2124,BOOK V.,"Breath 'gainst my breast. Nay, nor the baby arm"
2125,BOOK V.,Soft clasping me. Nor see the feet that pass
2126,BOOK V.,"Like falling music, through the waving grass."
2127,BOOK V.,"Therefore, one pardoning kiss give e'er I go"
2128,BOOK V.,"To my own land, beyond this realm of snow."""
2129,BOOK V.,"And Eve, uprising, took the hand she gave,"
2130,BOOK V.,"And weeping, kissed; and parted by that grave."
2131,BOOK V.,
2132,BOOK V.,"Stood Adam, after-time, by that small mound."
2133,BOOK V.,"Low at their feet a sheaf of leaves Eve found,"
2134,BOOK V.,"Wherein white flowers shone. ""Oh, like,"" she said,"
2135,BOOK V.,"""To this was one abloom within the bed"
2136,BOOK V.,"Where lies the child. And fair, O, passing fair,"
2137,BOOK V.,"She was, and tall, with yellow gleaming hair,"
2138,BOOK V.,And cheeks soft flushed as fresh pomegranate bells;
2139,BOOK V.,"And dewy eyes, like violets in the dells,"
2140,BOOK V.,"Who came. So, silent passed that stranger fair"
2141,BOOK V.,"Who loved our babe. And e'er I well was ware,"
2142,BOOK V.,"She vanished."""
2143,BOOK V.,"Otherwhiles, ""Of alien race"
2144,BOOK V.,"She was,"" Eve said. ""A princess, with a face"
2145,BOOK V.,"Surpassing fair, who trod the pathway bright"
2146,BOOK V.,"Among the mists, beyond the rim of night"
2147,BOOK V.,"To her own land."""
2148,BOOK V.,"And oft in after-time,"
2149,BOOK V.,"When Cain had lain in her young arms, and chime"
2150,BOOK V.,"Of voices round her came, and clasp of hands,"
2151,BOOK V.,"And thick with baby faces bloomed the lands,"
2152,BOOK V.,"Eve silent sat, remembering that one child"
2153,BOOK V.,"Among the snowdrops, in a Northern wild."
2154,BOOK V.,And Lilith dwelt again in her own land;
2155,BOOK V.,With Eblis still strayed far. And hand in hand
2156,BOOK V.,They talked; the while her phantom brood in glee
2157,BOOK V.,"Laughed overhead. Then looking on the sea,"
2158,BOOK V.,"Low voiced, she sang. So sweet the idle song,"
2159,BOOK V.,"She said, ""From Paradise, forgotten long,"
2160,BOOK V.,It comes. An elfin echo that doth rise
2161,BOOK V.,Upward from summer seas to bending skies.
2162,BOOK V.,"In coming days, from any earthly shore"
2163,BOOK V.,It shall not fail. And sweet forever more
2164,BOOK V.,Shall make my memory. That witching strain
2165,BOOK V.,Pale Lilith's love shall lightly breathe again.
2166,BOOK V.,And Lilith's bitter loss and olden pain
2167,BOOK V.,O'er every cradle wake that sweet refrain.
2168,BOOK V.,My memory still shall bloom. It cannot die
2169,BOOK V.,"While rings Earth's cradle-song--sweet lullaby."""
2170,BOOK V.,
2171,BOOK V.,"Slow passed dim cycles by, and in the earth"
2172,BOOK V.,Strange peoples swarmed; new nations sprang to birth.
2173,BOOK V.,Then first 'mong tented tribes men shuddering spake
2174,BOOK V.,"Dread tales of one that moved, an unseen shape,"
2175,BOOK V.,"'Mong chilling mists and snow. A spirit swift,"
2176,BOOK V.,That dwelt in lands beyond day's purple rift.
2177,BOOK V.,"Phantom of presage ill to babes unborn,"
2178,BOOK V.,Whose fast-sealed eyes ope not to earthly morn.
2179,BOOK V.,"""We heard,"" they cried, ""the Elf-babes shrilly scream,"
2180,BOOK V.,"And loud the Siren's song, when lightnings gleam."""
2181,BOOK V.,"Then they that by low beds all night did wake,"
2182,BOOK V.,"Prayed for the day, and feared to see it break."
2183,BOOK V.,
2184,BOOK V.,"When o'er the icy fjords cold rise white peaks,"
2185,BOOK V.,"And fierce wild storms blot out the frozen creeks,"
2186,BOOK V.,The Finnish mother to her breast more near
2187,BOOK V.,Draws her dear babe--clasps it in her wild fear
2188,BOOK V.,Still closer to her heart. And o'er and o'er
2189,BOOK V.,Through her weird song fall echoes from that lore
2190,BOOK V.,"That lived when Time was young, e'er yet the rime"
2191,BOOK V.,Of years lay on his brow. In that far prime
2192,BOOK V.,"Nature and man, couched 'neath God's earliest sky,"
2193,BOOK V.,Heard clear-voiced spheres chant Earth's first lullaby.
2194,BOOK V.,"Now, in the blast loud sings the Finn, and long,"
2195,BOOK V.,Nor knows that faint through her wild cradle-song
2196,BOOK V.,"Yet sweetly thrills the vanished Elf-babes' cry,"
2197,BOOK V.,"Nor dreams, as low she croons her lullaby,"
2198,BOOK V.,"Still breathes through that sweet, lingering refrain"
2199,BOOK V.,"Lilith the childless--and to life again,"
2200,BOOK V.,"To love, she wakes."
2201,BOOK V.,The soft strain clearer rings
2202,BOOK V.,As through the gathering storm that mother sings:
2203,BOOK V.,
2204,BOOK V.,"Pile the strong fagot,"
2205,BOOK V.,Pale Lilith comes!
2206,BOOK V.,Wild through the murky air goblin voices shout.
2207,BOOK V.,Hark! Hearest thou not their lusty rout?
2208,BOOK V.,Lilith comes!
2209,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2210,BOOK V.,
2211,BOOK V.,See how the dusk pines
2212,BOOK V.,Tremble and crouch;
2213,BOOK V.,"Over wide wastes borne, white are the snow-wreaths blown,"
2214,BOOK V.,And loud the drear icy fjords shudder and moan;
2215,BOOK V.,Lilith comes!
2216,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2217,BOOK V.,
2218,BOOK V.,"Ah! Hear the wild din,"
2219,BOOK V.,"Fierce o'er the linn,"
2220,BOOK V.,"The sea-gull, affrighted, soars seaward away,"
2221,BOOK V.,And dark on the shores falls the wind-driven spray;
2222,BOOK V.,Lilith comes!
2223,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2224,BOOK V.,
2225,BOOK V.,The shuddering ice
2226,BOOK V.,Shivers. It cracks!
2227,BOOK V.,"Like a wild beast in pain, it cries to the wrack"
2228,BOOK V.,Of the storm-cloud overhead. The sea answers back--
2229,BOOK V.,Dread Lilith comes!
2230,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2231,BOOK V.,
2232,BOOK V.,"Near draws the wraith fair,"
2233,BOOK V.,Dull gleams her hair.
2234,BOOK V.,"Ah, strong one, so cruel--fierce breath of the North--"
2235,BOOK V.,The torches of heaven are lighting thee forth!
2236,BOOK V.,Fell Lilith comes!
2237,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2238,BOOK V.,
2239,BOOK V.,"Cold spirit of Snow,"
2240,BOOK V.,"Ah, I fear thee!"
2241,BOOK V.,"The sports of my hunter, the white fox, the bear,"

2243,BOOK V.,"Dread Lilith, spare"
2244,BOOK V.,The babe at my breast!
2245,BOOK V.,
2246,BOOK V.,"Mercy, weird Lilith!"
2247,BOOK V.,"Even sleeping,"
2248,BOOK V.,"My babe lies so chill. See, the reindeer I give!"
2249,BOOK V.,"Ah, lift thy dark wings, that my darling may live!"
2250,BOOK V.,Pale Lilith comes!
2251,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2252,BOOK V.,
2253,BOOK V.,"Once, in the Northland,"
2254,BOOK V.,Pale crocus grew
2255,BOOK V.,By half-wakened stream. It lay shriveled and low
2256,BOOK V.,"Ere the spring-time had come, in soft shroud of snow."
2257,BOOK V.,Sad Lilith comes!
2258,BOOK V.,"Listen, my babe!"
2259,BOOK V.,
2260,BOOK V.,"Foul Vampire, drain not"
2261,BOOK V.,From my loved one
2262,BOOK V.,"The life-current red. O Demon, art breaking"

2268,BOOK V.,"Baby, behold"
2269,BOOK V.,"'Mid the mist and the snow, fast, fast, and more fast--"
2270,BOOK V.,In the teeth of the blast--flies Lilith at last.
2271,BOOK V.,Pale Lilith flies!
2272,BOOK V.,"Nearer, my babe!"
2273,BOOK V.,
2274,BOOK V.,By Ganges still the Indian mother weaves
2275,BOOK V.,"Above her babe her mat of plantain leaves,"
2276,BOOK V.,"And laughing, plaits. Or pausing, sweet and low"
2277,BOOK V.,Her voice blends with the river's drowsy flow;
2278,BOOK V.,"The while she fitful sings that old, old strain,"
2279,BOOK V.,"Forgetting that the love, the deathless pain"
2280,BOOK V.,Of wandering Lilith lives and throbs again
2281,BOOK V.,When falls the tricksy Elf-babes' mocking cry
2282,BOOK V.,Faintly across her crooning lullaby--
2283,BOOK V.,
2284,BOOK V.,"Ah, happy babe, that here may sleep"
2285,BOOK V.,"Where the blue river winds along,"
2286,BOOK V.,And sweet the trysting bulbuls keep
2287,BOOK V.,The night o'er-brimmed with pulsing song.
2288,BOOK V.,
2289,BOOK V.,"Not so, mine own, as legends tell,"
2290,BOOK V.,"In lands remote, beyond the day,"
2291,BOOK V.,"The soulless babes of Lilith dwell,"
2292,BOOK V.,Or vanish 'mong the cold mists gray.
2293,BOOK V.,
2294,BOOK V.,Or oft in elfin glee they ride
2295,BOOK V.,"O'er burning deserts blown adrift,"
2296,BOOK V.,"Or singing idly, idly glide"
2297,BOOK V.,Afar beyond Night's purple rift.
2298,BOOK V.,
2299,BOOK V.,"But thou, my babe, for thee shall grow"
2300,BOOK V.,"The lilies, nodding by the stream;"

2303,BOOK V.,
2304,BOOK V.,"My baby, sleep! Against the sky"
2305,BOOK V.,The pippul lifts its trembling crest.
2306,BOOK V.,"O baby, hush each wailing cry,"
2307,BOOK V.,Close to the holy river's breast.
2308,BOOK V.,
2309,BOOK V.,"Not here shall come that pale wraith fair,"
2310,BOOK V.,"Who, wandering once in Northern lands,"

2316,BOOK V.,They may not haunt thy slumbers still
2317,BOOK V.,Where Ganges' sacred waters flow.
2318,BOOK V.,
2319,BOOK V.,Where coral reefs gnaw with white cruel teeth
2320,BOOK V.,"The yellow surf, and the torn billows seethe--"
2321,BOOK V.,"When shines the Southern Cross o'er placid isles,"
2322,BOOK V.,"The Afric mother sits, and singing, smiles,"
2323,BOOK V.,Unheeding that a dead world's hidden pain
2324,BOOK V.,"Beats wildly rhythmic through her pure refrain,"
2325,BOOK V.,And lingers softly still an echoed sigh
2326,BOOK V.,Low in Earth's cradle-song--sweet lullaby.
2327,BOOK V.,"A warning song of doom--a song of woe,"
2328,BOOK V.,"Of terror wild, she sings, down bending low,"
2329,BOOK V.,The while bright gleams the Starry Cross above
2330,BOOK V.,Yet tells to her no tale of tender love
2331,BOOK V.,Of Him who lifteth after-time a cross
2332,BOOK V.,That healeth all the wide world's sin and loss.
2333,BOOK V.,
2334,BOOK V.,"Ah, linger no longer 'mong blooms of the mangoes,"
