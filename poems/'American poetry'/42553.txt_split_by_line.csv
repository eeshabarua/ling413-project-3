205,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"excursion to Canada with his friend Ellery Channing, and sent his"

212,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"changes. Break this up, if you can, and I will try to have it"
213,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"swallowed and digested."" Thoreau appears to have taken Greeley's"
214,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"advice, and the narrative was divided into chapters. But after it had"
215,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"been begun in _Putnam's_ in January, 1853, where it was entitled"

222,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
223,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,FRIEND THOREAU.... I am sorry you and C. cannot agree so as to
224,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,have your whole MS. printed. It will be worth nothing
225,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,elsewhere after having partly appeared in _Putnam's_. I think
226,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,it is a mistake to conceal the authorship of the several
227,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"articles, making them all (so to speak) _editorial_; but _if_"
228,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"that is done, don't you see that the elimination of very"
229,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,flagrant heresies (like your defiant Pantheism) becomes a
230,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,necessity? If you had withdrawn your MS. on account of the
231,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"abominable misprints in the first number, your ground would"
232,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"have been far more tenable. However, do what you will. Yours,"

236,HORACE GREELEY.,"""Natural History of Massachusetts"" was contributed to _The Dial_,"
237,HORACE GREELEY.,"July, 1842, nominally as a review of some recent State reports. ""A"
238,HORACE GREELEY.,"Walk to Wachusett"" was printed in _The Boston Miscellany_, 1843. Mr."
239,HORACE GREELEY.,"Sanborn, in his volume on Thoreau, prints a very interesting letter"
240,HORACE GREELEY.,"written by Margaret Fuller in 1841, in criticism of the verses which"
241,HORACE GREELEY.,"stand near the beginning of the paper, offered at that time for"
242,HORACE GREELEY.,"publication in _The Dial_. ""The Landlord"" was printed in _The"
243,HORACE GREELEY.,"Democratic Review_ for October, 1843. ""A Winter Walk"" appeared in _The"
244,HORACE GREELEY.,"Dial_ in the same month and year. Emerson in a letter to Thoreau,"
245,HORACE GREELEY.,"September 8, 1843, says: ""I mean to send the 'Winter's Walk' to the"
246,HORACE GREELEY.,"printer to-morrow for _The Dial_. I had some hesitation about it,"
247,HORACE GREELEY.,notwithstanding its faithful observation and its fine sketches of the
248,HORACE GREELEY.,"pickerel-fisher and of the woodchopper, on account of _mannerism_, an"
249,HORACE GREELEY.,"old charge of mine,--as if, by attention, one could get the trick of"
250,HORACE GREELEY.,"the rhetoric; for example, to call a cold place sultry, a solitude"
251,HORACE GREELEY.,"public, a wilderness _domestic_ (a favorite word), and in the woods to"
252,HORACE GREELEY.,"insult over cities, armies, etc. By pretty free omissions, however, I"
253,HORACE GREELEY.,"have removed my principal objections."" The address ""The Succession of"
254,HORACE GREELEY.,"Forest Trees"" was printed first in _The New York Tribune_, October 6,"
255,HORACE GREELEY.,"1860, and was perhaps the latest of his writings which Thoreau saw in"
256,HORACE GREELEY.,print.
257,HORACE GREELEY.,
258,HORACE GREELEY.,After his death the interest which had already been growing was
259,HORACE GREELEY.,quickened by the successive publication in _The Atlantic Monthly_ of
260,HORACE GREELEY.,"""Autumnal Tints"" and ""Wild Apples"" in October and November, 1862, and"
261,HORACE GREELEY.,"""Night and Moonlight"" November, 1863. The last named appeared just"
262,HORACE GREELEY.,"before the publication of the volume ""Excursions,"" which collected the"
263,HORACE GREELEY.,several papers.
264,HORACE GREELEY.,
265,HORACE GREELEY.,"""May Days"" and ""Days and Nights in Concord,"" which were printed in the"
266,HORACE GREELEY.,"Riverside Edition, are now omitted as consisting merely of extracts"
267,HORACE GREELEY.,from Thoreau's Journal and therefore superseded by the publication of
268,HORACE GREELEY.,the latter in its complete form.

272,HORACE GREELEY.,"A few of Thoreau's poems, taken from the ""Week"" and elsewhere, were"
273,HORACE GREELEY.,"added by Mr. Emerson to the volume entitled ""Letters to Various"
274,HORACE GREELEY.,"Persons"" which he brought out in 1865, but it was not till the volume"
275,HORACE GREELEY.,"of ""Miscellanies"" was issued in the Riverside Edition that the"
276,HORACE GREELEY.,otherwise unpublished verse of his that had appeared in _The Dial_ was
277,HORACE GREELEY.,"gathered into a single volume. Besides the _Dial_ contributions, the"
278,HORACE GREELEY.,"Riverside ""Miscellanies"" contained a few poems that first found"
279,HORACE GREELEY.,publication in Mr. Sanborn's Life of Thoreau. But the collection was
280,HORACE GREELEY.,not intended to be complete.
281,HORACE GREELEY.,
282,HORACE GREELEY.,"Many of Thoreau's poems, including his translations from the"
283,HORACE GREELEY.,"Anacreontics, are imbedded in the ""Week,"" ""Walden,"" and ""Excursions,"""
284,HORACE GREELEY.,"and it seemed best not to reproduce them in another volume. In 1895,"
285,HORACE GREELEY.,"shortly after the publication of the Riverside Thoreau, Mr. Henry S."
286,HORACE GREELEY.,"Salt and Mr. Frank B. Sanborn brought out a book entitled ""Poems of"
287,HORACE GREELEY.,"Nature by Henry David Thoreau,"" in which were collected ""perhaps two"
288,HORACE GREELEY.,"thirds of [the poems] which Thoreau preserved."" ""Many of them,"" says"
289,HORACE GREELEY.,"the Introduction to that volume, ""were printed by him, in whole or in"
290,HORACE GREELEY.,"part, among his early contributions to Emerson's _Dial_, or in his own"
291,HORACE GREELEY.,"two volumes, the _Week_ and _Walden_.... Others were given to Mr."
292,HORACE GREELEY.,"Sanborn for publication, by Sophia Thoreau, the year after her"
293,HORACE GREELEY.,brother's death (several appeared in the _Boston Commonwealth_ in
294,HORACE GREELEY.,"1863); or have been furnished from time to time by Mr. Blake, his"
295,HORACE GREELEY.,"literary executor."" This volume contained a number of poems which had"
296,HORACE GREELEY.,not before appeared in any of Thoreau's published books. Such poems
297,HORACE GREELEY.,are now added to those of the Riverside Edition. The present
298,HORACE GREELEY.,"collection, however, no more than its predecessors pretends to"
299,HORACE GREELEY.,completeness. It includes only those of Thoreau's poems which have
300,HORACE GREELEY.,been previously published and which are not contained in other volumes
301,HORACE GREELEY.,of this series. A list of the poems and scattered bits of verse
302,HORACE GREELEY.,printed in the other volumes will be found in an Appendix. The Journal
303,HORACE GREELEY.,"also contains, especially in the early part, a number of heretofore"
304,HORACE GREELEY.,unpublished poems which it seems best to retain in their original
305,HORACE GREELEY.,setting.

339,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
340,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"I fear that I have not got much to say about Canada, not having seen"
341,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"much; what I got by going to Canada was a cold. I left Concord,"
342,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Massachusetts, Wednesday morning, September 25th, 1850, for Quebec."
343,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Fare, seven dollars there and back; distance from Boston, five hundred"
344,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,and ten miles; being obliged to leave Montreal on the return as soon
345,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"as Friday, October 4th, or within ten days. I will not stop to tell"
346,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the reader the names of my fellow-travelers; there were said to be
347,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"fifteen hundred of them. I wished only to be set down in Canada, and"
348,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,take one honest walk there as I might in Concord woods of an
349,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,afternoon.
350,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
351,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,The country was new to me beyond Fitchburg. In Ashburnham and
352,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"afterward, as we were whirled rapidly along, I noticed the woodbine"
353,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"(_Ampelopsis quinquefolia_), its leaves now changed, for the most part"
354,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"on dead trees, draping them like a red scarf. It was a little"
355,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"exciting, suggesting bloodshed, or at least a military life, like an"
356,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"epaulet or sash, as if it were dyed with the blood of the trees whose"
357,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,wounds it was inadequate to stanch. For now the bloody autumn was
358,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"come, and an Indian warfare was waged through the forest. These"
359,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"military trees appeared very numerous, for our rapid progress"
360,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,connected those that were even some miles apart. Does the woodbine
361,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,prefer the elm? The first view of Monadnock was obtained five or six
362,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"miles this side of Fitzwilliam, but nearest and best at Troy and"
363,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,beyond. Then there were the Troy cuts and embankments. Keene Street
364,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"strikes the traveler favorably, it is so wide, level, straight, and"
365,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"long. I have heard one of my relatives, who was born and bred there,"
366,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,say that you could see a chicken run across it a mile off. I have also
367,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,been told that when this town was settled they laid out a street four
368,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"rods wide, but at a subsequent meeting of the proprietors one rose and"
369,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"remarked, ""We have plenty of land, why not make the street eight rods"
370,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"wide?"" and so they voted that it should be eight rods wide, and the"
371,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,town is known far and near for its handsome street. It was a cheap way
372,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"of securing comfort, as well as fame, and I wish that all new towns"
373,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,would take pattern from this. It is best to lay our plans widely in
374,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"youth, for then land is cheap, and it is but too easy to contract our"
375,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"views afterward. Youths so laid out, with broad avenues and parks,"
376,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,that they may make handsome and liberal old men! Show me a youth whose
377,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"mind is like some Washington city of magnificent distances, prepared"
378,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"for the most remotely successful and glorious life after all, when"
379,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,those spaces shall be built over and the idea of the founder be
380,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,realized. I trust that every New England boy will begin by laying out
381,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"a Keene Street through his head, eight rods wide. I know one such"
382,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Washington city of a man, whose lots as yet are only surveyed and"
383,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"staked out, and, except a cluster of shanties here and there, only the"
384,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Capitol stands there for all structures, and any day you may see from"
385,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,afar his princely idea borne coachwise along the spacious but yet
386,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,empty avenues. Keene is built on a remarkably large and level
387,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"interval, like the bed of a lake, and the surrounding hills, which are"
388,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"remote from its street, must afford some good walks. The scenery of"
389,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,mountain towns is commonly too much crowded. A town which is built on
390,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"a plain of some extent, with an open horizon, and surrounded by hills"
391,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"at a distance, affords the best walks and views."
392,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
393,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"As we travel northwest up the country, sugar maples, beeches, birches,"
394,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hemlocks, spruce, butternuts, and ash trees prevail more and more. To"
395,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the rapid traveler the number of elms in a town is the measure of its
396,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,civility. One man in the cars has a bottle full of some liquor. The
397,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,whole company smile whenever it is exhibited. I find no difficulty in
398,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,containing myself. The Westmoreland country looked attractive. I heard
399,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"a passenger giving the very obvious derivation of this name,"
400,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Westmore-land, as if it were purely American, and he had made a"
401,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"discovery; but I thought of ""my cousin Westmoreland"" in England. Every"
402,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"one will remember the approach to Bellows Falls, under a high cliff"
403,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,which rises from the Connecticut. I was disappointed in the size of
404,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the river here; it appeared shrunk to a mere mountain-stream. The
405,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,water was evidently very low. The rivers which we had crossed this
406,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,forenoon possessed more of the character of mountain-streams than
407,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"those in the vicinity of Concord, and I was surprised to see"
408,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"everywhere traces of recent freshets, which had carried away bridges"
409,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and injured the railroad, though I had heard nothing of it. In"
410,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Ludlow, Mount Holly, and beyond, there is interesting mountain"
411,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"scenery, not rugged and stupendous, but such as you could easily"
412,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"ramble over,--long, narrow, mountain vales through which to see the"
413,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,horizon. You are in the midst of the Green Mountains. A few more
414,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,elevated blue peaks are seen from the neighborhood of Mount Holly;
415,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"perhaps Killington Peak is one. Sometimes, as on the Western Railroad,"
416,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"you are whirled over mountainous embankments, from which the scared"
417,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,horses in the valleys appear diminished to hounds. All the hills
418,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,blush; I think that autumn must be the best season to journey over
419,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"even the _Green_ Mountains. You frequently exclaim to yourself, What"
420,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,_red_ maples! The sugar maple is not so red. You see some of the
421,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"latter with rosy spots or cheeks only, blushing on one side like"
422,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"fruit, while all the rest of the tree is green, proving either some"
423,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,partiality in the light or frosts or some prematurity in particular
424,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"branches. Tall and slender ash trees, whose foliage is turned to a"
425,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"dark mulberry color, are frequent. The butternut, which is a"
426,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"remarkably spreading tree, is turned completely yellow, thus proving"
427,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,its relation to the hickories. I was also struck by the bright yellow
428,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,tints of the yellow birch. The sugar maple is remarkable for its clean
429,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"ankle. The groves of these trees looked like vast forest sheds, their"
430,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"branches stopping short at a uniform height, four or five feet from"
431,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the ground, like eaves, as if they had been trimmed by art, so that"
432,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,you could look under and through the whole grove with its leafy
433,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"canopy, as under a tent whose curtain is raised."
434,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
435,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,As you approach Lake Champlain you begin to see the New York
436,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"mountains. The first view of the lake at Vergennes is impressive, but"
437,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,rather from association than from any peculiarity in the scenery. It
438,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,lies there so small (not appearing in that proportion to the width of
439,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the State that it does on the map), but beautifully quiet, like a"
440,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"picture of the Lake of Lucerne on a music-box, where you trace the"
441,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,name of Lucerne among the foliage; far more ideal than ever it looked
442,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"on the map. It does not say, ""Here I am, Lake Champlain,"" as the"
443,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"conductor might for it, but having studied the geography thirty years,"
444,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,you crossed over a hill one afternoon and beheld it. But it is only a
445,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,glimpse that you get here. At Burlington you rush to a wharf and go on
446,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"board a steamboat, two hundred and thirty-two miles from Boston. We"
447,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"left Concord at twenty minutes before eight in the morning, and were"
448,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"in Burlington about six at night, but too late to see the lake. We got"
449,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"our first fair view of the lake at dawn, just before reaching"
450,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Plattsburg, and saw blue ranges of mountains on either hand, in New"
451,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"York and in Vermont, the former especially grand. A few white"
452,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"schooners, like gulls, were seen in the distance, for it is not waste"
453,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,and solitary like a lake in Tartary; but it was such a view as leaves
454,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"not much to be said; indeed, I have postponed Lake Champlain to"
455,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,another day.
456,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
457,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,The oldest reference to these waters that I have yet seen is in the
458,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,account of Cartier's discovery and exploration of the St. Lawrence in
459,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,1535. Samuel Champlain actually discovered and paddled up the lake in
460,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"July, 1609, eleven years before the settlement of Plymouth,"
461,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,accompanying a war-party of the Canadian Indians against the
462,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Iroquois. He describes the islands in it as not inhabited, although"
463,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"they are pleasant,--on account of the continual wars of the Indians,"
464,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,in consequence of which they withdraw from the rivers and lakes into
465,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the depths of the land, that they may not be surprised. ""Continuing"
466,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"our course,"" says he, ""in this lake, on the western side, viewing the"
467,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"country, I saw on the eastern side very high mountains, where there"
468,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,was snow on the summit. I inquired of the savages if those places were
469,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"inhabited. They replied that they were, and that they were Iroquois,"
470,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,and that in those places there were beautiful valleys and plains
471,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"fertile in corn, such as I have eaten in this country, with an"
472,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"infinity of other fruits."" This is the earliest account of what is now"
473,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,Vermont.
474,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
475,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,The number of French-Canadian gentlemen and ladies among the
476,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"passengers, and the sound of the French language, advertised us by"
477,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,this time that we were being whirled towards some foreign vortex. And
478,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"now we have left Rouse's Point, and entered the Sorel River, and"
479,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,passed the invisible barrier between the States and Canada. The shores
480,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"of the Sorel, Richelieu, or St. John's River are flat and reedy, where"
481,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,I had expected something more rough and mountainous for a natural
482,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"boundary between two nations. Yet I saw a difference at once, in the"
483,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"few huts, in the pirogues on the shore, and as it were, in the shore"
484,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"itself. This was an interesting scenery to me, and the very reeds or"
485,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,rushes in the shallow water and the tree-tops in the swamps have left
486,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,a pleasing impression. We had still a distant view behind us of two or
487,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,three blue mountains in Vermont and New York. About nine o'clock in
488,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the forenoon we reached St. John's, an old frontier post three hundred"
489,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and six miles from Boston, and twenty-four from Montreal. We now"
490,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"discovered that we were in a foreign country, in a station-house of"
491,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"another nation. This building was a barn-like structure, looking as if"
492,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"it were the work of the villagers combined, like a log house in a new"
493,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,settlement. My attention was caught by the double advertisements in
494,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"French and English fastened to its posts, by the formality of the"
495,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"English, and the covert or open reference to their queen and the"
496,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"British lion. No gentlemanly conductor appeared, none whom you would"
497,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,know to be the conductor by his dress and demeanor; but ere long we
498,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"began to see here and there a solid, red-faced, burly-looking"
499,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Englishman, a little pursy perhaps, who made us ashamed of ourselves"
500,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and our thin and nervous countrymen,--a grandfatherly personage, at"
501,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"home in his greatcoat, who looked as if he might be a stage"
502,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"proprietor, certainly a railroad director, and knew, or had a right to"
503,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"know, when the cars did start. Then there were two or three"
504,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"pale-faced, black-eyed, loquacious Canadian-French gentlemen there,"
505,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,shrugging their shoulders; pitted as if they had all had the
506,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"small-pox. In the meanwhile some soldiers, redcoats, belonging to the"
507,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"barracks near by, were turned out to be drilled. At every important"
508,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,point in our route the soldiers showed themselves ready for us; though
509,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"they were evidently rather raw recruits here, they manoeuvred far"
510,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"better than our soldiers; yet, as usual, I heard some Yankees talk as"
511,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"if they were no great shakes, and they had seen the Acton Blues"
512,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"manoeuvre as well. The officers spoke sharply to them, and appeared"
513,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,to be doing their part thoroughly. I heard one suddenly coming to the
514,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"rear, exclaim, ""Michael Donouy, take his name!"" though I could not see"
515,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,what the latter did or omitted to do. It was whispered that Michael
516,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,Donouy would have to suffer for that. I heard some of our party
517,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,discussing the possibility of their driving these troops off the field
518,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"with their umbrellas. I thought that the Yankee, though undisciplined,"
519,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"had this advantage at least, that he especially is a man who,"
520,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"everywhere and under all circumstances, is fully resolved to better"
521,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"his condition essentially, and therefore he could afford to be beaten"
522,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"at first; while the virtue of the Irishman, and to a great extent the"
523,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Englishman, consists in merely maintaining his ground or condition."
524,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"The Canadians here, a rather poor-looking race, clad in gray homespun,"
525,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"which gave them the appearance of being covered with dust, were riding"
526,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,about in caleches and small one-horse carts called charettes. The
527,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Yankees assumed that all the riders were racing, or at least"
528,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"exhibiting the paces of their horses, and saluted them accordingly. We"
529,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"saw but little of the village here, for nobody could tell us when the"
530,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"cars would start; that was kept a profound secret, perhaps for"
531,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,political reasons; and therefore we were tied to our seats. The
532,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,inhabitants of St. John's and vicinity are described by an English
533,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"traveler as ""singularly unprepossessing,"" and before completing his"
534,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"period he adds, ""besides, they are generally very much disaffected to"
535,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the British crown."" I suspect that that ""besides"" should have been a"
536,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,because.
537,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
538,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"At length, about noon, the cars began to roll towards La Prairie. The"
539,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"whole distance of fifteen miles was over a remarkably level country,"
540,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"resembling a Western prairie, with the mountains about Chambly visible"
541,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,in the northeast. This novel but monotonous scenery was exciting. At
542,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"La Prairie we first took notice of the tinned roofs, but above all of"
543,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the St. Lawrence, which looked like a lake; in fact it is considerably"
544,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,expanded here; it was nine miles across diagonally to Montreal. Mount
545,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Royal in the rear of the city, and the island of St. Helen's opposite"
546,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"to it, were now conspicuous. We could also see the Sault St. Louis"
547,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"about five miles up the river, and the Sault Norman still farther"
548,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,eastward. The former are described as the most considerable rapids in
549,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the St. Lawrence; but we could see merely a gleam of light there as
550,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,from a cobweb in the sun. Soon the city of Montreal was discovered
551,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,with its tin roofs shining afar. Their reflections fell on the eye
552,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,like a clash of cymbals on the ear. Above all the church of Notre Dame
553,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"was conspicuous, and anon the Bonsecours market-house, occupying a"
554,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"commanding position on the quay, in the rear of the shipping. This"
555,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,city makes the more favorable impression from being approached by
556,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"water, and also being built of stone, a gray limestone found on the"
557,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"island. Here, after traveling directly inland the whole breadth of New"
558,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"England, we had struck upon a city's harbor,--it made on me the"
559,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"impression of a seaport,--to which ships of six hundred tons can"
560,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"ascend, and where vessels drawing fifteen feet lie close to the wharf,"
561,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"five hundred and forty miles from the Gulf, the St. Lawrence being"
562,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,here two miles wide. There was a great crowd assembled on the
563,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"ferry-boat wharf and on the quay to receive the Yankees, and flags of"
564,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,all colors were streaming from the vessels to celebrate their arrival.
565,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"When the gun was fired, the gentry hurrahed again and again, and then"
566,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the Canadian caleche-drivers, who were most interested in the matter,"
567,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and who, I perceived, were separated from the former by a fence,"
568,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hurrahed their welcome; first the broadcloth, then the homespun."
569,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
570,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,It was early in the afternoon when we stepped ashore. With a single
571,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"companion, I soon found my way to the church of Notre Dame. I saw that"
572,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,it was of great size and signified something. It is said to be the
573,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"largest ecclesiastical structure in North America, and can seat ten"
574,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"thousand. It is two hundred and fifty-five and a half feet long, and"
575,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the groined ceiling is eighty feet above your head. The Catholic are
576,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the only churches which I have seen worth remembering, which are not"
577,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,almost wholly profane. I do not speak only of the rich and splendid
578,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"like this, but of the humblest of them as well. Coming from the"
579,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hurrahing mob and the rattling carriages, we pushed aside the listed"
580,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"door of this church, and found ourselves instantly in an atmosphere"
581,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"which might be sacred to thought and religion, if one had any. There"
582,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,sat one or two women who had stolen a moment from the concerns of the
583,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"day, as they were passing; but, if there had been fifty people there,"
584,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,it would still have been the most solitary place imaginable. They did
585,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"not look up at us, nor did one regard another. We walked softly down"
586,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the broad aisle with our hats in our hands. Presently came in a troop
587,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"of Canadians, in their homespun, who had come to the city in the boat"
588,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"with us, and one and all kneeled down in the aisle before the high"
589,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"altar to their devotions, somewhat awkwardly, as cattle prepare to lie"
590,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"down, and there we left them. As if you were to catch some farmer's"
591,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"sons from Marlborough, come to cattle-show, silently kneeling in"
592,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,Concord meeting-house some Wednesday! Would there not soon be a mob
593,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"peeping in at the windows? It is true, these Roman Catholics, priests"
594,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and all, impress me as a people who have fallen far behind the"
595,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,significance of their symbols. It is as if an ox had strayed into a
596,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"church and were trying to bethink himself. Nevertheless, they are"
597,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,capable of reverence; but we Yankees are a people in whom this
598,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"sentiment has nearly died out, and in this respect we cannot bethink"
599,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"ourselves even as oxen. I did not mind the pictures nor the candles,"
600,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,whether tallow or tin. Those of the former which I looked at appeared
601,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,tawdry. It matters little to me whether the pictures are by a neophyte
602,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,of the Algonquin or the Italian tribe. But I was impressed by the
603,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"quiet, religious atmosphere of the place. It was a great cave in the"
604,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,midst of a city; and what were the altars and the tinsel but the
605,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"sparkling stalactites, into which you entered in a moment, and where"
606,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the still atmosphere and the sombre light disposed to serious and
607,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"profitable thought? Such a cave at hand, which you can enter any day,"
608,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"is worth a thousand of our churches which are open only Sundays,"
609,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hardly long enough for an airing, and then filled with a bustling"
610,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"congregation,--a church where the priest is the least part, where you"
611,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"do your own preaching, where the universe preaches to you and can be"
612,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,heard. I am not sure but this Catholic religion would be an admirable
613,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,one if the priest were quite omitted. I think that I might go to
614,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"church myself some Monday, if I lived in a city where there was such a"
615,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"one to go to. In Concord, to be sure, we do not need such. Our forests"
616,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"are such a church, far grander and more sacred. We dare not leave"
617,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,_our_ meeting-houses open for fear they would be profaned. Such a
618,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"cave, such a shrine, in one of our groves, for instance, how long"
619,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"would it be respected? for what purposes would it be entered, by such"
620,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"baboons as we are? I think of its value not only to religion, but to"
621,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"philosophy and to poetry; besides a reading-room, to have a"
622,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,thinking-room in every city! Perchance the time will come when every
623,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"house even will have not only its sleeping-rooms, and dining-room, and"
624,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"talking-room or parlor, but its thinking-room also, and the architects"
625,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,will put it into their plans. Let it be furnished and ornamented with
626,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,whatever conduces to serious and creative thought. I should not object
627,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"to the holy water, or any other simple symbol, if it were consecrated"
628,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,by the imagination of the worshipers.
629,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
630,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"I heard that some Yankees bet that the candles were not wax, but tin."
631,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"A European assured them that they were wax; but, inquiring of the"
632,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"sexton, he was surprised to learn that they were tin filled with oil."
633,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"The church was too poor to afford wax. As for the Protestant churches,"
634,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"here or elsewhere, they did not interest me, for it is only as caves"
635,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"that churches interest me at all, and in that respect they were"
636,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,inferior.
637,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
638,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,Montreal makes the impression of a larger city than you had expected
639,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"to find, though you may have heard that it contains nearly sixty"
640,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"thousand inhabitants. In the newer parts, it appeared to be growing"
641,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"fast like a small New York, and to be considerably Americanized. The"
642,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"names of the squares reminded you of Paris,--the Champ de Mars, the"
643,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Place d'Armes, and others,--and you felt as if a French revolution"
644,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,might break out any moment. Glimpses of Mount Royal rising behind the
645,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"town, and the names of some streets in that direction, make one think"
646,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,of Edinburgh. That hill sets off this city wonderfully. I inquired at
647,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,a principal bookstore for books published in Montreal. They said that
648,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,there were none but school-books and the like; they got their books
649,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"from the States. From time to time we met a priest in the streets, for"
650,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"they are distinguished by their dress, like the _civil_ police. Like"
651,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"clergymen generally, with or without the gown, they made on us the"
652,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"impression of effeminacy. We also met some Sisters of Charity, dressed"
653,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"in black, with Shaker-shaped black bonnets and crosses, and cadaverous"
654,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"faces, who looked as if they had almost cried their eyes out, their"
655,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,complexions parboiled with scalding tears; insulting the daylight by
656,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"their presence, having taken an oath not to smile. By cadaverous I"
657,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,mean that their faces were like the faces of those who have been dead
658,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"and buried for a year, and then untombed, with the life's grief upon"
659,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"them, and yet, for some unaccountable reason, the process of decay"
660,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,arrested.
661,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
662,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"""Truth never fails her servant, sir, nor leaves him"
663,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"With the day's shame upon him."""
664,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
665,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,They waited demurely on the sidewalk while a truck laden with raisins
666,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"was driven in at the seminary of St. Sulpice, never once lifting their"
667,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,eyes from the ground.
668,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
669,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"The soldier here, as everywhere in Canada, appeared to be put forward,"
670,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,and by his best foot. They were in the proportion of the soldiers to
671,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the laborers in an African ant-hill. The inhabitants evidently rely on
672,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,them in a great measure for music and entertainment. You would meet
673,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,with them pacing back and forth before some guard-house or
674,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"passage-way, guarding, regarding, and disregarding all kinds of law by"
675,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"turns, apparently for the sake of the discipline to themselves, and"
676,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,not because it was important to exclude anybody from entering that
677,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,way. They reminded me of the men who are paid for piling up bricks and
678,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,then throwing them down again. On every prominent ledge you could see
679,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"England's hands holding the Canadas, and I judged by the redness of"
680,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,her knuckles that she would soon have to let go. In the rear of such a
681,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"guard-house, in a large graveled square or parade ground, called the"
682,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Champ de Mars, we saw a large body of soldiers being drilled, we being"
683,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,as yet the only spectators. But they did not appear to notice us any
684,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"more than the devotees in the church, but were seemingly as"
685,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"indifferent to fewness of spectators as the phenomena of nature are,"
686,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,whatever they might have been thinking under their helmets of the
687,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,Yankees that were to come. Each man wore white kid gloves. It was one
688,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,of the most interesting sights which I saw in Canada. The problem
689,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,appeared to be how to smooth down all individual protuberances or
690,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"idiosyncrasies, and make a thousand men move as one man, animated by"
691,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,one central will; and there was some approach to success. They obeyed
692,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the signals of a commander who stood at a great distance, wand in"
693,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hand; and the precision, and promptness, and harmony of their"
694,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,movements could not easily have been matched. The harmony was far more
695,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"remarkable than that of any choir or band, and obtained, no doubt, at"
696,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"a greater cost. They made on me the impression, not of many"
697,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"individuals, but of one vast centipede of a man, good for all sorts of"
698,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,pulling down; and why not then for some kinds of building up? If men
699,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"could combine thus earnestly, and patiently, and harmoniously to some"
700,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"really worthy end, what might they not accomplish? They now put their"
701,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"hands, and partially perchance their heads together, and the result is"
702,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,that they are the imperfect tools of an imperfect and tyrannical
703,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,government. But if they could put their hands and heads and hearts and
704,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"all together, such a coöperation and harmony would be the very end and"
705,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"success for which government now exists in vain,--a government, as it"
706,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"were, not only with tools, but stock to trade with."
707,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
708,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,I was obliged to frame some sentences that sounded like French in
709,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"order to deal with the market-women, who, for the most part, cannot"
710,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,speak English. According to the guidebook the relative population of
711,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,this city stands nearly thus: two fifths are French-Canadian; nearly
712,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"one fifth British-Canadian; one and a half fifths English, Irish, and"
713,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Scotch; somewhat less than one half fifth Germans, United States"
714,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"people, and others. I saw nothing like pie for sale, and no good cake"
715,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"to put in my bundle, such as you can easily find in our towns, but"
716,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"plenty of fair-looking apples, for which Montreal Island is"
717,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"celebrated, and also pears cheaper and I thought better than ours, and"
718,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"peaches, which, though they were probably brought from the South, were"
719,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,as cheap as they commonly are with us. So imperative is the law of
720,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"demand and supply that, as I have been told, the market of Montreal is"
721,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,sometimes supplied with green apples from the State of New York some
722,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,weeks even before they are ripe in the latter place. I saw here the
723,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"spruce wax which the Canadians chew, done up in little silvered"
724,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"papers, a penny a roll; also a small and shriveled fruit which they"
725,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"called _cerises_, mixed with many little stems, somewhat like raisins,"
726,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"but I soon returned what I had bought, finding them rather insipid,"
727,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"only putting a sample in my pocket. Since my return, I find on"
728,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,comparison that it is the fruit of the sweet viburnum (_Viburnum
729,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"Lentago_), which with us rarely holds on till it is ripe."
730,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,
731,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"I stood on the deck of the steamer John Munn, late in the afternoon,"
732,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"when the second and third ferry-boats arrived from La Prairie,"
733,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"bringing the remainder of the Yankees. I never saw so many caleches,"
734,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"cabs, charettes, and similar vehicles collected before, and doubt if"
735,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,New York could easily furnish more. The handsome and substantial stone
736,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,quay which stretches a mile along the riverside and protects the
737,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,street from the ice was thronged with the citizens who had turned out
738,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,on foot and in carriages to welcome or to behold the Yankees. It was
739,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,interesting to see the caleche-drivers dash up and down the slope of
740,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,the quay with their active little horses. They drive much faster than
741,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,in our cities. I have been told that some of them come nine miles into
742,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"the city every morning and return every night, without changing their"
743,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"horses during the day. In the midst of the crowd of carts, I observed"
744,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"one deep one loaded with sheep with their legs tied together, and"
745,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"their bodies piled one upon another, as if the driver had forgotten"
746,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"that they were sheep and not yet mutton,--a sight, I trust, peculiar"
747,CONCORD TO MONTREAL,"to Canada, though I fear that it is not."

755,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
756,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
757,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"About six o'clock we started for Quebec, one hundred and eighty miles"
758,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,distant by the river; gliding past Longueuil and Boucherville on the
759,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"right, and Pointe aux Trembles, ""so called from having been originally"
760,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"covered with aspens,"" and Bout de l'Isle, or the end of the island, on"
761,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,the left. I repeat these names not merely for want of more substantial
762,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"facts to record, but because they sounded singularly poetic to my"
763,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,ears. There certainly was no lie in them. They suggested that some
764,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"simple, and, perchance, heroic human life might have transpired there."
765,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,There is all the poetry in the world in a name. It is a poem which the
766,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"mass of men hear and read. What is poetry in the common sense, but a"
767,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,string of such jingling names? I want nothing better than a good word.
768,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,The name of a thing may easily be more than the thing itself to me.
769,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Inexpressibly beautiful appears the recognition by man of the least
770,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"natural fact, and the allying his life to it. All the world"
771,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"reiterating this slender truth, that aspens once grew there; and the"
772,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,swift inference is that men were there to see them. And so it would be
773,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"with the names of our native and neighboring villages, if we had not"
774,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,profaned them.
775,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
776,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"The daylight now failed us, and we went below; but I endeavored to"
777,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"console myself for being obliged to make this voyage by night, by"
778,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"thinking that I did not lose a great deal, the shores being low and"
779,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rather unattractive, and that the river itself was much the more"
780,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,interesting object. I heard something in the night about the boat
781,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"being at William Henry, Three Rivers, and in the Richelieu Rapids, but"
782,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,I was still where I had been when I lost sight of Pointe aux Trembles.
783,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,To hear a man who has been waked up at midnight in the cabin of a
784,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"steamboat inquiring, ""Waiter, where are we now?"" is as if, at any"
785,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"moment of the earth's revolution round the sun, or of the system round"
786,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"its centre, one were to raise himself up and inquire of one of the"
787,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"deck hands, ""Where are we now?"""
788,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
789,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"I went on deck at daybreak, when we were thirty or forty miles above"
790,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Quebec. The banks were now higher and more interesting. There was an
791,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"""uninterrupted succession of whitewashed cottages,"" on each side of"
792,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,the river. This is what every traveler tells. But it is not to be
793,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"taken as an evidence of the populousness of the country in general,"
794,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,hardly even of the river-banks. They have presented a similar
795,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,appearance for a hundred years. The Swedish traveler and naturalist
796,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Kalm, who descended the river in 1749, says, ""It could really be"
797,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"called a village, beginning at Montreal and ending at Quebec, which is"
798,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,a distance of more than one hundred and eighty miles; for the
799,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"farmhouses are never above five arpents, and sometimes but three"
800,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"asunder, a few places excepted."" Even in 1684 Hontan said that the"
801,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,houses were not more than a gunshot apart at most. Ere long we passed
802,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Cape Rouge, eight miles above Quebec, the mouth of the Chaudière on"
803,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,the opposite or south side; New Liverpool Cove with its lumber-rafts
804,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,and some shipping; then Sillery and Wolfe's Cove and the Heights of
805,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Abraham on the north, with now a view of Cape Diamond, and the citadel"
806,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,in front. The approach to Quebec was very imposing. It was about six
807,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,o'clock in the morning when we arrived. There is but a single street
808,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"under the cliff on the south side of the cape, which was made by"
809,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,blasting the rocks and filling up the river. Three-story houses did
810,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,not rise more than one fifth or one sixth the way up the nearly
811,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"perpendicular rock, whose summit is three hundred and forty-five feet"
812,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"above the water. We saw, as we glided past, the sign on the side of"
813,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the precipice, part way up, pointing to the spot where Montgomery was"
814,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,killed in 1775. Formerly it was the custom for those who went to
815,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Quebec for the first time to be ducked, or else pay a fine. Not even"
816,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the Governor-General escaped. But we were too many to be ducked, even"
817,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,if the custom had not been abolished.[1]
818,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
819,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Here we were, in the harbor of Quebec, still three hundred and sixty"
820,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"miles from the mouth of the St. Lawrence, in a basin two miles across,"
821,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"where the greatest depth is twenty-eight fathoms, and though the water"
822,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"is fresh, the tide rises seventeen to twenty-four feet,--a harbor"
823,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"""large and deep enough,"" says a British traveler, ""to hold the English"
824,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"navy."" I may as well state that, in 1844, the county of Quebec"
825,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,contained about forty-five thousand inhabitants (the city and suburbs
826,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"having about forty-three thousand),--about twenty-eight thousand being"
827,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Canadians of French origin; eight thousand British; over seven
828,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,thousand natives of Ireland; one thousand five hundred natives of
829,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,England; the rest Scotch and others. Thirty-six thousand belong to the
830,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Church of Rome.
831,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
832,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Separating ourselves from the crowd, we walked up a narrow street,"
833,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"thence ascended by some wooden steps, called the Break-neck Stairs,"
834,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"into another steep, narrow, and zigzag street, blasted through the"
835,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rock, which last led through a low, massive stone portal, called"
836,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Prescott Gate, the principal thoroughfare into the Upper Town. This"
837,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"passage was defended by cannon, with a guard-house over it, a sentinel"
838,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"at his post, and other soldiers at hand ready to relieve him. I rubbed"
839,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"my eyes to be sure that I was in the Nineteenth Century, and was not"
840,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,entering one of those portals which sometimes adorn the frontispieces
841,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of new editions of old black-letter volumes. I thought it would be a
842,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,good place to read Froissart's Chronicles. It was such a reminiscence
843,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of the Middle Ages as Scott's novels. Men apparently dwelt there for
844,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,security! Peace be unto them! As if the inhabitants of New York were
845,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,to go over to Castle William to live! What a place it must be to bring
846,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"up children! Being safe through the gate, we naturally took the street"
847,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"which was steepest, and after a few turns found ourselves on the"
848,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Durham Terrace, a wooden platform on the site of the old castle of St."
849,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Louis, still one hundred and fifteen feet below the summit of the"
850,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"citadel, overlooking the Lower Town, the wharf where we had landed,"
851,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the harbor, the Isle of Orleans, and the river and surrounding country"
852,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to a great distance. It was literally a _splendid_ view. We could see,"
853,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"six or seven miles distant, in the northeast, an indentation in the"
854,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"lofty shore of the northern channel, apparently on one side of the"
855,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"harbor, which marked the mouth of the Montmorenci, whose celebrated"
856,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,fall was only a few rods in the rear.
857,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
858,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"At a shoe-shop, whither we were directed for this purpose, we got some"
859,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of our American money changed into English. I found that American hard
860,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"money would have answered as well, excepting cents, which fell very"
861,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"fast before their pennies, it taking two of the former to make one of"
862,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the latter, and often the penny, which had cost us two cents, did us"
863,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the service of one cent only. Moreover, our robust cents were"
864,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"compelled to meet on even terms a crew of vile half-penny tokens, and"
865,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Bungtown coppers, which had more brass in their composition, and so"
866,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,perchance made their way in the world. Wishing to get into the
867,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"citadel, we were directed to the Jesuits' Barracks,--a good part of"
868,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the public buildings here are barracks,--to get a pass of the Town"
869,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Major. We did not heed the sentries at the gate, nor did they us, and"
870,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"what under the sun they were placed there for, unless to hinder a free"
871,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"circulation of the air, was not apparent. There we saw soldiers eating"
872,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"their breakfasts in their mess-room, from bare wooden tables in camp"
873,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"fashion. We were continually meeting with soldiers in the streets,"
874,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"carrying funny little tin pails of all shapes, even semicircular, as"
875,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,if made to pack conveniently. I supposed that they contained their
876,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"dinners,--so many slices of bread and butter to each, perchance."
877,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Sometimes they were carrying some kind of military chest on a sort of
878,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"bier or hand-barrow, with a springy, undulating, military step, all"
879,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"passengers giving way to them, even the charette-drivers stopping for"
880,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"them to pass,--as if the battle were being lost from an inadequate"
881,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"supply of powder. There was a regiment of Highlanders, and, as I"
882,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"understood, of Royal Irish, in the city; and by this time there was a"
883,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"regiment of Yankees also. I had already observed, looking up even from"
884,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the water, the head and shoulders of some General Poniatowsky, with an"
885,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"enormous cocked hat and gun, peering over the roof of a house, away up"
886,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"where the chimney caps commonly are with us, as it were a caricature"
887,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of war and military awfulness; but I had not gone far up St. Louis
888,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Street before my riddle was solved, by the apparition of a real live"
889,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Highlander under a cocked hat, and with his knees out, standing and"
890,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"marching sentinel on the ramparts, between St. Louis and St. John's"
891,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Gate. (It must be a holy war that is waged there.) We stood close by
892,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"without fear and looked at him. His legs were somewhat tanned, and the"
893,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"hair had begun to grow on them, as some of our wise men predict that"
894,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"it will in such cases, but I did not think they were remarkable in any"
895,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"respect. Notwithstanding all his warlike gear, when I inquired of him"
896,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the way to the Plains of Abraham, he could not answer me without"
897,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"betraying some bashfulness through his broad Scotch. Soon after, we"
898,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,passed another of these creatures standing sentry at the St. Louis
899,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Gate, who let us go by without shooting us, or even demanding the"
900,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"countersign. We then began to go through the gate, which was so thick"
901,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and tunnel-like as to remind me of those lines in Claudian's ""Old Man"
902,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"of Verona,"" about the getting out of the gate being the greater part"
903,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of a journey;--as you might imagine yourself crawling through an
904,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,architectural vignette _at the end_ of a black-letter volume. We were
905,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"then reminded that we had been in a fortress, from which we emerged by"
906,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"numerous zigzags in a ditch-like road, going a considerable distance"
907,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to advance a few rods, where they could have shot us two or three"
908,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"times over, if their minds had been disposed as their guns were. The"
909,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"greatest, or rather the most prominent, part of this city was"
910,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,constructed with the design to offer the deadest resistance to leaden
911,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,and iron missiles that might be cast against it. But it is a
912,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"remarkable meteorological and psychological fact, that it is rarely"
913,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"known to rain lead with much violence, except on places so"
914,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,constructed. Keeping on about a mile we came to the Plains of
915,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Abraham,--for having got through with the Saints, we came next to the"
916,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Patriarchs. Here the Highland regiment was being reviewed, while the"
917,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,band stood on one side and played--methinks it was _La Claire
918,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Fontaine_, the national air of the Canadian French. This is the site"
919,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"where a real battle once took place, to commemorate which they have"
920,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,had a sham fight here almost every day since. The Highlanders
921,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"manoeuvred very well, and if the precision of their movements was"
922,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"less remarkable, they did not appear so stiffly erect as the English"
923,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"or Royal Irish, but had a more elastic and graceful gait, like a herd"
924,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"of their own red deer, or as if accustomed to stepping down the sides"
925,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"of mountains. But they made a sad impression on the whole, for it was"
926,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,obvious that all true manhood was in the process of being drilled out
927,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"of them. I have no doubt that soldiers well drilled are, as a class,"
928,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,peculiarly destitute of originality and independence. The officers
929,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,appeared like men dressed above their condition. It is impossible to
930,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,give the soldier a good education without making him a deserter. His
931,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,natural foe is the government that drills him. What would any
932,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,philanthropist who felt an interest in these men's welfare naturally
933,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"do, but first of all teach them so to respect themselves that they"
934,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"could not be hired for this work, whatever might be the consequences"
935,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to this government or that?--not drill a few, but educate all. I"
936,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"observed one older man among them, gray as a wharf-rat, and supple as"
937,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the devil, marching lock-step with the rest, who would have to pay for"
938,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,that elastic gait.
939,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
940,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"We returned to the citadel along the heights, plucking such flowers as"
941,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"grew there. There was an abundance of succory still in blossom,"
942,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"broad-leaved goldenrod, buttercups, thorn bushes, Canada thistles, and"
943,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"ivy, on the very summit of Cape Diamond. I also found the bladder"
944,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"campion in the neighborhood. We there enjoyed an extensive view, which"
945,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"I will describe in another place. Our pass, which stated that all the"
946,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rules were ""to be strictly enforced,"" as if they were determined to"
947,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"keep up the semblance of reality to the last gasp, opened to us the"
948,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Dalhousie Gate, and we were conducted over the citadel by a"
949,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,bare-legged Highlander in cocked hat and full regimentals. He told us
950,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"that he had been here about three years, and had formerly been"
951,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"stationed at Gibraltar. As if his regiment, having perchance been"
952,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"nestled amid the rocks of Edinburgh Castle, must flit from rock to"
953,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rock thenceforth over the earth's surface, like a bald eagle, or other"
954,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"bird of prey, from eyrie to eyrie. As we were going out, we met the"
955,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Yankees coming in, in a body headed by a red-coated officer called the"
956,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"commandant, and escorted by many citizens, both English and"
957,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"French-Canadian. I therefore immediately fell into the procession, and"
958,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"went round the citadel again with more intelligent guides, carrying,"
959,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"as before, all my effects with me. Seeing that nobody walked with the"
960,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"red-coated commandant, I attached myself to him, and though I was not"
961,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"what is called well-dressed, he did not know whether to repel me or"
962,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"not, for I talked like one who was not aware of any deficiency in that"
963,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,respect. Probably there was not one among all the Yankees who went to
964,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Canada this time, who was not more splendidly dressed than I was. It"
965,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,would have been a poor story if I had not enjoyed some distinction. I
966,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"had on my ""bad-weather clothes,"" like Olaf Trygvesson the Northman,"
967,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"when he went to the Thing in England, where, by the way, he won his"
968,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,bride. As we stood by the thirty-two-pounder on the summit of Cape
969,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Diamond, which is fired three times a day, the commandant told me that"
970,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"it would carry to the Isle of Orleans, four miles distant, and that no"
971,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,hostile vessel could come round the island. I now saw the subterranean
972,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"or rather ""casemated"" barracks of the soldiers, which I had not"
973,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"noticed before, though I might have walked over them. They had very"
974,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"narrow windows, serving as loop-holes for musketry, and small iron"
975,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,chimneys rising above the ground. There we saw the soldiers at home
976,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and in an undress, splitting wood,--I looked to see whether with"
977,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"swords or axes,--and in various ways endeavoring to realize that their"
978,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,nation was now at peace with this part of the world. A part of each
979,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"regiment, chiefly officers, are allowed to marry. A grandfatherly,"
980,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,would-be witty Englishman could give a Yankee whom he was patronizing
981,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"no reason for the bare knees of the Highlanders, other than oddity."
982,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"The rock within the citadel is a little convex, so that shells falling"
983,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"on it would roll toward the circumference, where the barracks of the"
984,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"soldiers and officers are; it has been proposed, therefore, to make it"
985,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"slightly concave, so that they may roll into the centre, where they"
986,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,would be comparatively harmless; and it is estimated that to do this
987,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,would cost twenty thousand pounds sterling. It may be well to remember
988,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"this when I build my next house, and have the roof ""all correct"" for"
989,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,bomb-shells.
990,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
991,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"At mid-afternoon we made haste down Sault-au-Matelot Street, towards"
992,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the Falls of Montmorenci, about eight miles down the St. Lawrence, on"
993,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the north side, leaving the further examination of Quebec till our"
994,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"return. On our way, we saw men in the streets sawing logs pit-fashion,"
995,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and afterward, with a common wood-saw and horse, cutting the planks"
996,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"into squares for paving the streets. This looked very shiftless,"
997,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"especially in a country abounding in water-power, and reminded me that"
998,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"I was no longer in Yankeeland. I found, on inquiry, that the excuse"
999,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"for this was that labor was so cheap; and I thought, with some pain,"
1000,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,how cheap men are here! I have since learned that the English traveler
1001,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Warburton remarked, soon after landing at Quebec, that everything was"
1002,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,cheap there but men. That must be the difference between going thither
1003,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,from New and from Old England. I had already observed the dogs
1004,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"harnessed to their little milk-carts, which contain a single large"
1005,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"can, lying asleep in the gutters regardless of the horses, while they"
1006,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rested from their labors, at different stages of the ascent in the"
1007,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,Upper Town. I was surprised at the regular and extensive use made of
1008,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"these animals for drawing not only milk but groceries, wood, etc. It"
1009,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,reminded me that the dog commonly is not put to any use. Cats catch
1010,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"mice; but dogs only worry the cats. Kalm, a hundred years ago, saw"
1011,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"sledges here for ladies to ride in, drawn by a pair of dogs. He says,"
1012,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"""A middle-sized dog is sufficient to draw a single person, when the"
1013,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"roads are good;"" and he was told by old people that horses were very"
1014,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"scarce in their youth, and almost all the land-carriage was then"
1015,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"effected by dogs. They made me think of the Esquimaux, who, in fact,"
1016,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,are the next people on the north. Charlevoix says that the first
1017,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,horses were introduced in 1665.
1018,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1019,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"We crossed Dorchester Bridge, over the St. Charles, the little river"
1020,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"in which Cartier, the discoverer of the St. Lawrence, put his ships,"
1021,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and spent the winter of 1535, and found ourselves on an excellent"
1022,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"macadamized road, called Le Chemin de Beauport. We had left Concord"
1023,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Wednesday morning, and we endeavored to realize that now, Friday"
1024,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"morning, we were taking a walk in Canada, in the Seigniory of"
1025,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Beauport, a foreign country, which a few days before had seemed"
1026,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,almost as far off as England and France. Instead of rambling to
1027,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Flint's Pond or the Sudbury meadows, we found ourselves, after being a"
1028,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"little detained in cars and steamboats,--after spending half a night"
1029,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"at Burlington, and half a day at Montreal,--taking a walk down the"
1030,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,bank of the St. Lawrence to the Falls of Montmorenci and elsewhere.
1031,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Well, I thought to myself, here I am in a foreign country; let me have"
1032,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"my eyes about me, and take it all in. It already looked and felt a"
1033,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"good deal colder than it had in New England, as we might have expected"
1034,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"it would. I realized fully that I was four degrees nearer the pole,"
1035,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,and shuddered at the thought; and I wondered if it were possible that
1036,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,the peaches might not be all gone when I returned. It was an
1037,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"atmosphere that made me think of the fur-trade, which is so"
1038,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"interesting a department in Canada, for I had for all head-covering a"
1039,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"thin palm-leaf hat without lining, that cost twenty-five cents, and"
1040,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"over my coat one of those unspeakably cheap, as well as thin, brown"
1041,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"linen sacks of the Oak Hall pattern, which every summer appear all"
1042,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"over New England, thick as the leaves upon the trees. It was a"
1043,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"thoroughly Yankee costume, which some of my fellow-travelers wore in"
1044,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the cars to save their coats a dusting. I wore mine, at first, because"
1045,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"it looked better than the coat it covered, and last, because two coats"
1046,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"were warmer than one, though one was thin and dirty. I never wear my"
1047,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"best coat on a journey, though perchance I could show a certificate to"
1048,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"prove that I have a more costly one, at least, at home, if that were"
1049,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,all that a gentleman required. It is not wise for a traveler to go
1050,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,dressed. I should no more think of it than of putting on a clean
1051,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,dicky and blacking my shoes to go a-fishing; as if you were going out
1052,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to dine, when, in fact, the genuine traveler is going out to work"
1053,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"hard, and fare harder,--to eat a crust by the wayside whenever he can"
1054,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"get it. Honest traveling is about as dirty work as you can do, and a"
1055,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,man needs a pair of overalls for it. As for blacking my shoes in such
1056,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"a case, I should as soon think of blacking my face. I carry a piece of"
1057,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,tallow to preserve the leather and keep out the water; that's all; and
1058,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"many an officious shoe-black, who carried off my shoes when I was"
1059,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"slumbering, mistaking me for a gentleman, has had occasion to repent"
1060,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,it before he produced a gloss on them.
1061,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1062,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"My pack, in fact, was soon made, for I keep a short list of those"
1063,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"articles which, from frequent experience, I have found indispensable"
1064,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to the foot-traveler; and, when I am about to start, I have only to"
1065,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"consult that, to be sure that nothing is omitted, and, what is more"
1066,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"important, nothing superfluous inserted. Most of my fellow-travelers"
1067,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"carried carpet-bags, or valises. Sometimes one had two or three"
1068,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"ponderous yellow valises in his clutch, at each hitch of the cars, as"
1069,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,if we were going to have another rush for seats; and when there was a
1070,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"rush in earnest,--and there were not a few,--I would see my man in the"
1071,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"crowd, with two or three affectionate lusty fellows along each side of"
1072,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"his arm, between his shoulder and his valises, which last held them"
1073,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"tight to his back, like the nut on the end of a screw. I could not"
1074,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"help asking in my mind, What so great cause for showing Canada to"
1075,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"those valises, when perhaps your very nieces had to stay at home for"
1076,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,want of an escort? I should have liked to be present when the
1077,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"custom-house officer came aboard of him, and asked him to declare upon"
1078,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,his honor if he had anything but wearing apparel in them. Even the
1079,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,elephant carries but a small trunk on his journeys. The perfection of
1080,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,traveling is to travel without baggage. After considerable reflection
1081,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and experience, I have concluded that the best bag for the"
1082,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"foot-traveler is made with a handkerchief, or, if he study"
1083,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"appearances, a piece of stiff brown paper, well tied up, with a fresh"
1084,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,piece within to put outside when the first is torn. That is good for
1085,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"both town and country, and none will know but you are carrying home"
1086,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the silk for a new gown for your wife, when it may be a dirty shirt. A"
1087,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"bundle which you can carry literally under your arm, and which will"
1088,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,shrink and swell with its contents. I never found the carpet-bag of
1089,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,equal capacity which was not a bundle of itself. We styled ourselves
1090,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the Knights of the Umbrella and the Bundle; for, wherever we went,"
1091,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"whether to Notre Dame or Mount Royal or the Champ de Mars, to the Town"
1092,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Major's or the Bishop's Palace, to the Citadel, with a bare-legged"
1093,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Highlander for our escort, or to the Plains of Abraham, to dinner or"
1094,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"to bed, the umbrella and the bundle went with us; for we wished to be"
1095,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,ready to digress at any moment. We made it our home nowhere in
1096,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"particular, but everywhere where our umbrella and bundle were. It"
1097,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"would have been an amusing circumstance, if the mayor of one of those"
1098,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,cities had politely asked us where we were staying. We could only have
1099,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,answered that we were staying with his honor for the time being. I was
1100,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"amused when, after our return, some green ones inquired if we found it"
1101,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"easy to get accommodated; as if we went abroad to get accommodated,"
1102,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,when we can get that at home.
1103,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1104,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"We met with many charettes, bringing wood and stone to the city. The"
1105,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"most ordinary-looking horses traveled faster than ours, or perhaps"
1106,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"they were ordinary-looking because, as I am told, the Canadians do not"
1107,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"use the curry-comb. Moreover, it is said that on the approach of"
1108,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"winter their horses acquire an increased quantity of hair, to protect"
1109,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"them from the cold. If this be true, some of our horses would make you"
1110,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"think winter were approaching, even in midsummer. We soon began to see"
1111,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"women and girls at work in the fields, digging potatoes alone, or"
1112,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"bundling up the grain which the men cut. They appeared in rude health,"
1113,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"with a great deal of color in their cheeks, and, if their occupation"
1114,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"had made them coarse, it impressed me as better in its effects than"
1115,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"making shirts at fourpence apiece, or doing nothing at all--unless it"
1116,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,be chewing slate-pencils--with still smaller results. They were much
1117,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"more agreeable objects, with their great broad-brimmed hats and"
1118,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"flowing dresses, than the men and boys. We afterwards saw them doing"
1119,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"various other kinds of work; indeed, I thought that we saw more women"
1120,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"at work out of doors than men. On our return, we observed in this town"
1121,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"a girl, with Indian boots nearly two feet high, taking the harness off"
1122,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,a dog.
1123,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1124,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,The purity and transparency of the atmosphere were wonderful. When we
1125,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"had been walking an hour, we were surprised, on turning round, to see"
1126,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"how near the city, with its glittering tin roofs, still looked. A"
1127,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,village ten miles off did not appear to be more than three or four. I
1128,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,was convinced that you could see objects distinctly there much
1129,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"farther than here. It is true the villages are of a dazzling white,"
1130,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"but the dazzle is to be referred, perhaps, to the transparency of the"
1131,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,atmosphere as much as to the whitewash.
1132,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1133,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"We were now fairly in the village of Beauport, though there was still"
1134,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"but one road. The houses stood close upon this, without any front"
1135,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"yards, and at an angle with it, as if they had dropped down, being set"
1136,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,with more reference to the road which the sun travels. It being about
1137,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"sundown, and the falls not far off, we began to look round for a"
1138,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"lodging, for we preferred to put up at a private house, that we might"
1139,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,see more of the inhabitants. We inquired first at the most
1140,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"promising-looking houses,--if, indeed, any were promising. When we"
1141,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"knocked, they shouted some French word for come in, perhaps _Entrez_,"
1142,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and we asked for a lodging in English; but we found, unexpectedly,"
1143,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,that they spoke French only. Then we went along and tried another
1144,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"house, being generally saluted by a rush of two or three little curs,"
1145,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"which readily distinguished a foreigner, and which we were prepared"
1146,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"now to hear bark in French. Our first question would be ""Parlez-vous"
1147,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Anglais?"" but the invariable answer was ""Non, monsieur;"" and we soon"
1148,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"found that the inhabitants were exclusively French Canadians, and"
1149,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"nobody spoke English at all, any more than in France; that, in fact,"
1150,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"we were in a foreign country, where the inhabitants uttered not one"
1151,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"familiar sound to us. Then we tried by turns to talk French with them,"
1152,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"in which we succeeded sometimes pretty well, but for the most part"
1153,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"pretty ill. ""Pouvez-vous nous donner un lit cette nuit?"" we would"
1154,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"ask, and then they would answer with French volubility, so that we"
1155,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,could catch only a word here and there. We could understand the women
1156,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"and children generally better than the men, and they us; and thus,"
1157,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"after a while, we would learn that they had no more beds than they"
1158,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,used.
1159,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1160,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"So we were compelled to inquire, ""Y a-t-il une maison publique ici?"""
1161,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"(_auberge_ we should have said, perhaps, for they seemed never to have"
1162,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"heard of the other), and they answered at length that there was no"
1163,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"tavern, unless we could get lodgings at the mill, _le moulin_, which"
1164,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"we had passed; or they would direct us to a grocery, and almost every"
1165,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,house had a small grocery at one end of it. We called on the public
1166,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"notary or village lawyer, but he had no more beds nor English than the"
1167,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,rest. At one house there was so good a misunderstanding at once
1168,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"established through the politeness of all parties, that we were"
1169,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"encouraged to walk in and sit down, and ask for a glass of water; and"
1170,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"having drank their water, we thought it was as good as to have tasted"
1171,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,their salt. When our host and his wife spoke of their poor
1172,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"accommodations, meaning for themselves, we assured them that they were"
1173,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"good enough, for we thought that they were only apologizing for the"
1174,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"poorness of the accommodations they were about to offer us, and we did"
1175,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"not discover our mistake till they took us up a ladder into a loft,"
1176,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,and showed to our eyes what they had been laboring in vain to
1177,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"communicate to our brains through our ears, that they had but that one"
1178,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,apartment with its few beds for the whole family. We made our _adieus_
1179,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"forthwith, and with gravity, perceiving the literal signification of"
1180,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"that word. We were finally taken in at a sort of public house, whose"
1181,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"master worked for Patterson, the proprietor of the extensive sawmills"
1182,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"driven by a portion of the Montmorenci stolen from the fall, whose"
1183,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"roar we now heard. We here talked, or murdered, French all the"
1184,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"evening, with the master of the house and his family, and probably had"
1185,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,a more amusing time than if we had completely understood one another.
1186,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"At length they showed us to a bed in their best chamber, very high to"
1187,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"get into, with a low wooden rail to it. It had no cotton sheets, but"
1188,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"coarse, home-made, dark-colored linen ones. Afterward, we had to do"
1189,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"with sheets still coarser than these, and nearly the color of our"
1190,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,blankets. There was a large open buffet loaded with crockery in one
1191,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"corner of the room, as if to display their wealth to travelers, and"
1192,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"pictures of Scripture scenes, French, Italian, and Spanish, hung"
1193,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,around. Our hostess came back directly to inquire if we would have
1194,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"brandy for breakfast. The next morning, when I asked their names, she"
1195,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"took down the temperance pledges of herself and husband and children,"
1196,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,which were hanging against the wall. They were Jean Baptiste Binet and
1197,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"his wife, Geneviève Binet. Jean Baptiste is the sobriquet of the"
1198,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,French Canadians.
1199,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1200,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"After breakfast we proceeded to the fall, which was within half a"
1201,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"mile, and at this distance its rustling sound, like the wind among the"
1202,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"leaves, filled all the air. We were disappointed to find that we were"
1203,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,in some measure shut out from the west side of the fall by the private
1204,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"grounds and fences of Patterson, who appropriates not only a part of"
1205,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"the water for his mill, but a still larger part of the prospect, so"
1206,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,that we were obliged to trespass. This gentleman's mansion-house and
1207,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"grounds were formerly occupied by the Duke of Kent, father to Queen"
1208,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Victoria. It appeared to me in bad taste for an individual, though he"
1209,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"were the father of Queen Victoria, to obtrude himself with his land"
1210,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"titles, or at least his fences, on so remarkable a natural phenomenon,"
1211,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"which should, in every sense, belong to mankind. Some falls should"
1212,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"even be kept sacred from the intrusion of mills and factories, as"
1213,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,water privileges in another than the millwright's sense. This small
1214,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,river falls perpendicularly nearly two hundred and fifty feet at one
1215,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,pitch. The St. Lawrence falls only one hundred and sixty-four feet at
1216,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Niagara. It is a very simple and noble fall, and leaves nothing to be"
1217,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,desired; but the most that I could say of it would only have the force
1218,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,of one other testimony to assure the reader that it is there. We
1219,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"looked directly down on it from the point of a projecting rock, and"
1220,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"saw far below us, on a low promontory, the grass kept fresh and green"
1221,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"by the perpetual drizzle, looking like moss. The rock is a kind of"
1222,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"slate, in the crevices of which grew ferns and goldenrods. The"
1223,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"prevailing trees on the shores were spruce and arbor-vitæ,--the latter"
1224,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"very large and now full of fruit,--also aspens, alders, and the"
1225,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,mountain-ash with its berries. Every emigrant who arrives in this
1226,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"country by way of the St. Lawrence, as he opens a point of the Isle of"
1227,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Orleans, sees the Montmorenci tumbling into the Great River thus"
1228,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"magnificently in a vast white sheet, making its contribution with"
1229,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"emphasis. Roberval's pilot, Jean Alphonse, saw this fall thus, and"
1230,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"described it, in 1542. It is a splendid introduction to the scenery of"
1231,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Quebec. Instead of an artificial fountain in its square, Quebec has"
1232,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"this magnificent natural waterfall, to adorn one side of its harbor."
1233,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"Within the mouth of the chasm below, which can be entered only at"
1234,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"ebb-tide, we had a grand view at once of Quebec and of the fall. Kalm"
1235,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"says that the noise of the fall is sometimes heard at Quebec, about"
1236,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"eight miles distant, and is a sign of a northeast wind. The side of"
1237,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"this chasm, of soft and crumbling slate too steep to climb, was among"
1238,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,the memorable features of the scene. In the winter of 1829 the frozen
1239,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"spray of the fall, descending on the ice of the St. Lawrence, made a"
1240,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,hill one hundred and twenty-six feet high. It is an annual phenomenon
1241,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,which some think may help explain the formation of glaciers.
1242,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,
1243,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,In the vicinity of the fall we began to notice what looked like our
1244,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"red-fruited thorn bushes, grown to the size of ordinary apple trees,"
1245,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"very common, and full of large red or yellow fruit, which the"
1246,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,"inhabitants called _pommettes_, but I did not learn that they were put"
1247,QUEBEC AND MONTMORENCI,to any use.

1265,ST. ANNE,
1266,ST. ANNE,
1267,ST. ANNE,"By the middle of the forenoon, though it was a rainy day, we were once"
1268,ST. ANNE,"more on our way down the north bank of the St. Lawrence, in a"
1269,ST. ANNE,"northeasterly direction, toward the Falls of St. Anne, which are about"
1270,ST. ANNE,"thirty miles from Quebec. The settled, more level, and fertile portion"
1271,ST. ANNE,"of Canada East may be described rudely as a triangle, with its apex"
1272,ST. ANNE,"slanting toward the northeast, about one hundred miles wide at its"
1273,ST. ANNE,"base, and from two to three or even four hundred miles long, if you"
1274,ST. ANNE,reckon its narrow northeastern extremity; it being the immediate
1275,ST. ANNE,"valley of the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, rising by a single or"
1276,ST. ANNE,by successive terraces toward the mountains on either hand. Though the
1277,ST. ANNE,words Canada East on the map stretch over many rivers and lakes and
1278,ST. ANNE,"unexplored wildernesses, the actual Canada, which might be the colored"
1279,ST. ANNE,"portion of the map, is but a little clearing on the banks of the"
1280,ST. ANNE,"river, which one of those syllables would more than cover. The banks"
1281,ST. ANNE,of the St. Lawrence are rather low from Montreal to the Richelieu
1282,ST. ANNE,"Rapids, about forty miles above Quebec. Thence they rise gradually to"
1283,ST. ANNE,"Cape Diamond, or Quebec. Where we now were, eight miles northeast of"
1284,ST. ANNE,"Quebec, the mountains which form the northern side of this triangle"
1285,ST. ANNE,"were only five or six miles distant from the river, gradually"
1286,ST. ANNE,"departing farther and farther from it, on the west, till they reach"
1287,ST. ANNE,"the Ottawa, and making haste to meet it on the east, at Cape"
1288,ST. ANNE,"Tourmente, now in plain sight about twenty miles distant. So that we"
1289,ST. ANNE,were traveling in a very narrow and sharp triangle between the
1290,ST. ANNE,"mountains and the river, tilted up toward the mountains on the north,"
1291,ST. ANNE,never losing sight of our great fellow-traveler on our right.
1292,ST. ANNE,"According to Bouchette's Topographical Description of the Canadas, we"
1293,ST. ANNE,"were in the Seigniory of the Côte de Beaupré, in the county of"
1294,ST. ANNE,"Montmorenci, and the district of Quebec,--in that part of Canada which"
1295,ST. ANNE,"was the first to be settled, and where the face of the country and the"
1296,ST. ANNE,"population have undergone the least change from the beginning, where"
1297,ST. ANNE,"the influence of the States and of Europe is least felt, and the"
1298,ST. ANNE,inhabitants see little or nothing of the world over the walls of
1299,ST. ANNE,"Quebec. This Seigniory was granted in 1636, and is now the property of"
1300,ST. ANNE,the Seminary of Quebec. It is the most mountainous one in the
1301,ST. ANNE,"province. There are some half a dozen parishes in it, each containing"
1302,ST. ANNE,"a church, parsonage-house, gristmill, and several sawmills. We were"
1303,ST. ANNE,"now in the most westerly parish, called Ange Gardien, or the Guardian"
1304,ST. ANNE,"Angel, which is bounded on the west by the Montmorenci. The north bank"
1305,ST. ANNE,"of the St. Lawrence here is formed on a grand scale. It slopes gently,"
1306,ST. ANNE,"either directly from the shore or from the edge of an interval, till,"
1307,ST. ANNE,"at the distance of about a mile, it attains the height of four or five"
1308,ST. ANNE,hundred feet. The single road runs along the side of the slope two or
1309,ST. ANNE,"three hundred feet above the river at first, and from a quarter of a"
1310,ST. ANNE,"mile to a mile distant from it, and affords fine views of the north"
1311,ST. ANNE,"channel, which is about a mile wide, and of the beautiful Isle of"
1312,ST. ANNE,"Orleans, about twenty miles long by five wide, where grow the best"
1313,ST. ANNE,apples and plums in the Quebec district.
1314,ST. ANNE,
1315,ST. ANNE,"Though there was but this single road, it was a continuous village for"
1316,ST. ANNE,"as far as we walked this day and the next, or about thirty miles down"
1317,ST. ANNE,"the river, the houses being as near together all the way as in the"
1318,ST. ANNE,"middle of one of our smallest straggling country villages, and we"
1319,ST. ANNE,could never tell by their number when we were on the skirts of a
1320,ST. ANNE,"parish, for the road never ran through the fields or woods. We were"
1321,ST. ANNE,told that it was just six miles from one parish church to another. I
1322,ST. ANNE,"thought that we saw every house in Ange Gardien. Therefore, as it was"
1323,ST. ANNE,"a muddy day, we never got out of the mud, nor out of the village,"
1324,ST. ANNE,"unless we got over the fence; then, indeed, if it was on the north"
1325,ST. ANNE,"side, we were out of the civilized world. There were sometimes a few"
1326,ST. ANNE,"more houses near the church, it is true, but we had only to go a"
1327,ST. ANNE,"quarter of a mile from the road, to the top of the bank, to find"
1328,ST. ANNE,"ourselves on the verge of the uninhabited, and, for the most part,"
1329,ST. ANNE,unexplored wilderness stretching toward Hudson's Bay. The farms
1330,ST. ANNE,"accordingly were extremely long and narrow, each having a frontage on"
1331,ST. ANNE,the river. Bouchette accounts for this peculiar manner of laying out a
1332,ST. ANNE,"village by referring to ""the social character of the Canadian peasant,"
1333,ST. ANNE,"who is singularly fond of neighborhood,"" also to the advantage arising"
1334,ST. ANNE,"from a concentration of strength in Indian times. Each farm, called"
1335,ST. ANNE,"_terre_, he says, is, in nine cases out of ten, three arpents wide by"
1336,ST. ANNE,"thirty deep, that is, very nearly thirty-five by three hundred and"
1337,ST. ANNE,"forty-nine of our rods; sometimes one half arpent by thirty, or one to"
1338,ST. ANNE,"sixty; sometimes, in fact, a few yards by half a mile. Of course it"
1339,ST. ANNE,costs more for fences. A remarkable difference between the Canadian
1340,ST. ANNE,"and the New England character appears from the fact that, in 1745, the"
1341,ST. ANNE,French government were obliged to pass a law forbidding the farmers or
1342,ST. ANNE,_censitaires_ building on land less than one and a half arpents front
1343,ST. ANNE,"by thirty or forty deep, under a certain penalty, in order to compel"
1344,ST. ANNE,"emigration, and bring the seigneur's estates all under cultivation;"
1345,ST. ANNE,and it is thought that they have now less reluctance to leave the
1346,ST. ANNE,"paternal roof than formerly, ""removing beyond the sight of the parish"
1347,ST. ANNE,"spire, or the sound of the parish bell."" But I find that in the"
1348,ST. ANNE,"previous or seventeenth century, the complaint, often renewed, was of"
1349,ST. ANNE,"a totally opposite character, namely, that the inhabitants dispersed"
1350,ST. ANNE,"and exposed themselves to the Iroquois. Accordingly, about 1664, the"
1351,ST. ANNE,"king was obliged to order that ""they should make no more clearings"
1352,ST. ANNE,"except one next to another, and that they should reduce their parishes"
1353,ST. ANNE,"to the form of the parishes in France as much as possible."" The"
1354,ST. ANNE,"Canadians of those days, at least, possessed a roving spirit of"
1355,ST. ANNE,"adventure which carried them further, in exposure to hardship and"
1356,ST. ANNE,"danger, than ever the New England colonist went, and led them, though"
1357,ST. ANNE,"not to clear and colonize the wilderness, yet to range over it as"
1358,ST. ANNE,"_coureurs de bois_, or runners of the woods, or, as Hontan prefers to"
1359,ST. ANNE,"call them, _coureurs de risques_, runners of risks; to say nothing of"
1360,ST. ANNE,their enterprising priesthood; and Charlevoix thinks that if the
1361,ST. ANNE,authorities had taken the right steps to prevent the youth from
1362,ST. ANNE,"ranging the woods (_de courir les bois_), they would have had an"
1363,ST. ANNE,excellent militia to fight the Indians and English.
1364,ST. ANNE,
1365,ST. ANNE,The road in this clayey-looking soil was exceedingly muddy in
1366,ST. ANNE,consequence of the night's rain. We met an old woman directing her
1367,ST. ANNE,"dog, which was harnessed to a little cart, to the least muddy part of"
1368,ST. ANNE,"it. It was a beggarly sight. But harnessed to the cart as he was, we"
1369,ST. ANNE,"heard him barking after we had passed, though we looked anywhere but"
1370,ST. ANNE,to the cart to see where the dog was that barked. The houses commonly
1371,ST. ANNE,"fronted the south, whatever angle they might make with the road; and"
1372,ST. ANNE,frequently they had no door nor cheerful window on the road side. Half
1373,ST. ANNE,"the time they stood fifteen to forty rods from the road, and there was"
1374,ST. ANNE,"no very obvious passage to them, so that you would suppose that there"
1375,ST. ANNE,"must be another road running by them. They were of stone, rather"
1376,ST. ANNE,"coarsely mortared, but neatly whitewashed, almost invariably one story"
1377,ST. ANNE,"high and long in proportion to their height, with a shingled roof, the"
1378,ST. ANNE,"shingles being pointed, for ornament, at the eaves, like the pickets"
1379,ST. ANNE,"of a fence, and also one row halfway up the roof. The gables sometimes"
1380,ST. ANNE,projected a foot or two at the ridge-pole only. Yet they were very
1381,ST. ANNE,humble and unpretending dwellings. They commonly had the date of their
1382,ST. ANNE,"erection on them. The windows opened in the middle, like blinds, and"
1383,ST. ANNE,"were frequently provided with solid shutters. Sometimes, when we"
1384,ST. ANNE,"walked along the back side of a house which stood near the road, we"
1385,ST. ANNE,"observed stout stakes leaning against it, by which the shutters, now"
1386,ST. ANNE,"pushed half open, were fastened at night; within, the houses were"
1387,ST. ANNE,neatly ceiled with wood not painted. The oven was commonly out of
1388,ST. ANNE,"doors, built of stone and mortar, frequently on a raised platform of"
1389,ST. ANNE,"planks. The cellar was often on the opposite side of the road, in"
1390,ST. ANNE,"front of or behind the houses, looking like an ice-house with us, with"
1391,ST. ANNE,a lattice door for summer. The very few mechanics whom we met had an
1392,ST. ANNE,"old-Bettyish look, in their aprons and _bonnets rouges_ like fools'"
1393,ST. ANNE,"caps. The men wore commonly the same _bonnet rouge_, or red woolen or"
1394,ST. ANNE,"worsted cap, or sometimes blue or gray, looking to us as if they had"
1395,ST. ANNE,"got up with their night-caps on, and, in fact, I afterwards found that"
1396,ST. ANNE,"they had. Their clothes were of the cloth of the country, _étoffe du"
1397,ST. ANNE,"pays_, gray or some other plain color. The women looked stout, with"
1398,ST. ANNE,"gowns that stood out stiffly, also, for the most part, apparently of"
1399,ST. ANNE,some home-made stuff. We also saw some specimens of the more
1400,ST. ANNE,"characteristic winter dress of the Canadian, and I have since"
1401,ST. ANNE,frequently detected him in New England by his coarse gray homespun
1402,ST. ANNE,"capote and picturesque red sash, and his well-furred cap, made to"
1403,ST. ANNE,protect his ears against the severity of his climate.
1404,ST. ANNE,
1405,ST. ANNE,"It drizzled all day, so that the roads did not improve. We began now"
1406,ST. ANNE,"to meet with wooden crosses frequently, by the roadside, about a dozen"
1407,ST. ANNE,"feet high, often old and toppling down, sometimes standing in a square"
1408,ST. ANNE,"wooden platform, sometimes in a pile of stones, with a little niche"
1409,ST. ANNE,"containing a picture of the Virgin and Child, or of Christ alone,"
1410,ST. ANNE,"sometimes with a string of beads, and covered with a piece of glass to"
1411,ST. ANNE,"keep out the rain, with the words, _Pour la Vierge_, or INRI, on them."
1412,ST. ANNE,"Frequently, on the cross-bar, there would be quite a collection of"
1413,ST. ANNE,"symbolical knickknacks, looking like an Italian's board; the"
1414,ST. ANNE,"representation in wood of a hand, a hammer, spikes, pincers, a flask"
1415,ST. ANNE,"of vinegar, a ladder, etc., the whole, perchance, surmounted by a"
1416,ST. ANNE,weathercock; but I could not look at an honest weathercock in this
1417,ST. ANNE,walk without mistrusting that there was some covert reference in it to
1418,ST. ANNE,St. Peter. From time to time we passed a little one-story chapel-like
1419,ST. ANNE,"building, with a tin-roofed spire, a shrine, perhaps it would be"
1420,ST. ANNE,"called, close to the path-side, with a lattice door, through which we"
1421,ST. ANNE,"could see an altar, and pictures about the walls; equally open,"
1422,ST. ANNE,"through rain and shine, though there was no getting into it. At these"
1423,ST. ANNE,places the inhabitants kneeled and perhaps breathed a short prayer. We
1424,ST. ANNE,"saw one schoolhouse in our walk, and listened to the sounds which"
1425,ST. ANNE,"issued from it; but it appeared like a place where the process, not of"
1426,ST. ANNE,"enlightening, but of obfuscating the mind was going on, and the pupils"
1427,ST. ANNE,received only so much light as could penetrate the shadow of the
1428,ST. ANNE,"Catholic Church. The churches were very picturesque, and their"
1429,ST. ANNE,interior much more showy than the dwelling-houses promised. They were
1430,ST. ANNE,"of stone, for it was ordered, in 1699, that that should be their"
1431,ST. ANNE,"material. They had tinned spires, and quaint ornaments. That of Ange"
1432,ST. ANNE,"Gardien had a dial on it, with the Middle Age Roman numerals on its"
1433,ST. ANNE,"face, and some images in niches on the outside. Probably its"
1434,ST. ANNE,counterpart has existed in Normandy for a thousand years. At the
1435,ST. ANNE,"church of Château Richer, which is the next parish to Ange Gardien, we"
1436,ST. ANNE,"read, looking over the wall, the inscriptions in the adjacent"
1437,ST. ANNE,"churchyard, which began with _Ici gît_ or _Repose_, and one over a boy"
1438,ST. ANNE,contained _Priez pour lui_. This answered as well as Père la Chaise.
1439,ST. ANNE,"We knocked at the door of the curé's house here, when a sleek,"
1440,ST. ANNE,"friar-like personage, in his sacerdotal robe, appeared. To our"
1441,ST. ANNE,"""Parlez-vous Anglais?"" even he answered, ""Non, monsieur;"" but at last"
1442,ST. ANNE,we made him understand what we wanted. It was to find the ruins of the
1443,ST. ANNE,"old _château_. ""Ah! oui! oui!"" he exclaimed, and, donning his coat,"
1444,ST. ANNE,"hastened forth, and conducted us to a small heap of rubbish which we"
1445,ST. ANNE,"had already examined. He said that fifteen years before, it was _plus"
1446,ST. ANNE,considérable_. Seeing at that moment three little red birds fly out of
1447,ST. ANNE,"a crevice in the ruins, up into an arbor-vitæ tree which grew out of"
1448,ST. ANNE,"them, I asked him their names, in such French as I could muster, but"
1449,ST. ANNE,he neither understood me nor ornithology; he only inquired where we
1450,ST. ANNE,"had _appris à parler Français_; we told him, _dans les États-Unis_;"
1451,ST. ANNE,and so we bowed him into his house again. I was surprised to find a
1452,ST. ANNE,"man wearing a black coat, and with apparently no work to do, even in"
1453,ST. ANNE,that part of the world.
1454,ST. ANNE,
1455,ST. ANNE,The universal salutation from the inhabitants whom we met was _bon
1456,ST. ANNE,"jour_, at the same time touching the hat; with _bon jour_, and"
1457,ST. ANNE,"touching your hat, you may go smoothly through all Canada East. A"
1458,ST. ANNE,"little boy, meeting us, would remark, ""Bon jour, monsieur; le chemin"
1459,ST. ANNE,"est mauvais"" (Good morning, sir; it is bad walking). Sir Francis Head"
1460,ST. ANNE,"says that the immigrant is forward to ""appreciate the happiness of"
1461,ST. ANNE,living in a land in which the old country's servile custom of touching
1462,ST. ANNE,"the hat does not exist,"" but he was thinking of Canada West, of"
1463,ST. ANNE,"course. It would, indeed, be a serious bore to be obliged to touch"
1464,ST. ANNE,your hat several times a day. A Yankee has not leisure for it.
1465,ST. ANNE,
1466,ST. ANNE,"We saw peas, and even beans, collected into heaps in the fields. The"
1467,ST. ANNE,"former are an important crop here, and, I suppose, are not so much"
1468,ST. ANNE,"infested by the weevil as with us. There were plenty of apples, very"
1469,ST. ANNE,"fair and sound, by the roadside, but they were so small as to suggest"
1470,ST. ANNE,"the origin of the apple in the crab. There was also a small, red fruit"
1471,ST. ANNE,"which they called _snells_, and another, also red and very acid, whose"
1472,ST. ANNE,"name a little boy wrote for me, ""_pinbéna_."" It is probably the same"
1473,ST. ANNE,"with, or similar to, the _pembina_ of the voyageurs, a species of"
1474,ST. ANNE,"viburnum, which, according to Richardson, has given its name to many"
1475,ST. ANNE,"of the rivers of Rupert's Land. The forest trees were spruce,"
1476,ST. ANNE,"arbor-vitæ, firs, birches, beeches, two or three kinds of maple,"
1477,ST. ANNE,"basswood, wild cherry, aspens, etc., but no pitch pines (_Pinus"
1478,ST. ANNE,"rigida_). I saw very few, if any, trees which had been set out for"
1479,ST. ANNE,shade or ornament. The water was commonly running streams or springs
1480,ST. ANNE,"in the bank by the roadside, and was excellent. The parishes are"
1481,ST. ANNE,"commonly separated by a stream, and frequently the farms. I noticed"
1482,ST. ANNE,that the fields were furrowed or thrown into beds seven or eight feet
1483,ST. ANNE,wide to dry the soil.
1484,ST. ANNE,
1485,ST. ANNE,"At the Rivière du Sault à la Puce, which, I suppose, means the River"
1486,ST. ANNE,"of the Fall of the Flea, was advertised in English, as the sportsmen"
1487,ST. ANNE,"are English, ""The best Snipe-shooting grounds,"" over the door of a"
1488,ST. ANNE,small public house. These words being English affected me as if I had
1489,ST. ANNE,"been absent now ten years from my country, and for so long had not"
1490,ST. ANNE,"heard the sound of my native language, and every one of them was as"
1491,ST. ANNE,"interesting to me as if I had been a snipe-shooter, and they had been"
1492,ST. ANNE,"snipes. The prunella, or self-heal, in the grass here, was an old"
1493,ST. ANNE,acquaintance. We frequently saw the inhabitants washing or cooking
1494,ST. ANNE,"for their pigs, and in one place hackling flax by the roadside. It was"
1495,ST. ANNE,pleasant to see these usually domestic operations carried on out of
1496,ST. ANNE,"doors, even in that cold country."
1497,ST. ANNE,
1498,ST. ANNE,"At twilight we reached a bridge over a little river, the boundary"
1499,ST. ANNE,"between Château Richer and St. Anne, _le premier pont de Ste. Anne_,"
1500,ST. ANNE,and at dark the church of _La Bonne Ste. Anne_. Formerly vessels from
1501,ST. ANNE,"France, when they came in sight of this church, gave ""a general"
1502,ST. ANNE,"discharge of their artillery,"" as a sign of joy that they had escaped"
1503,ST. ANNE,all the dangers of the river. Though all the while we had grand views
1504,ST. ANNE,"of the adjacent country far up and down the river, and, for the most"
1505,ST. ANNE,"part, when we turned about, of Quebec in the horizon behind us, and we"
1506,ST. ANNE,"never beheld it without new surprise and admiration; yet, throughout"
1507,ST. ANNE,"our walk, the Great River of Canada on our right hand was the main"
1508,ST. ANNE,"feature in the landscape, and this expands so rapidly below the Isle"
1509,ST. ANNE,"of Orleans, and creates such a breadth of level horizon above its"
1510,ST. ANNE,"waters in that direction, that, looking down the river as we"
1511,ST. ANNE,"approached the extremity of that island, the St. Lawrence seemed to be"
1512,ST. ANNE,"opening into the ocean, though we were still about three hundred and"
1513,ST. ANNE,twenty-five miles from what can be called its mouth.[2]
1514,ST. ANNE,
1515,ST. ANNE,When we inquired here for a _maison publique_ we were directed
1516,ST. ANNE,apparently to that private house where we were most likely to find
1517,ST. ANNE,"entertainment. There were no guide-boards where we walked, because"
1518,ST. ANNE,"there was but one road; there were no shops nor signs, because there"
1519,ST. ANNE,"were no artisans to speak of, and the people raised their own"
1520,ST. ANNE,"provisions; and there were no taverns, because there were no"
1521,ST. ANNE,"travelers. We here bespoke lodging and breakfast. They had, as usual,"
1522,ST. ANNE,"a large, old-fashioned, two-storied box stove in the middle of the"
1523,ST. ANNE,"room, out of which, in due time, there was sure to be forthcoming a"
1524,ST. ANNE,"supper, breakfast, or dinner. The lower half held the fire, the upper"
1525,ST. ANNE,"the hot air, and as it was a cool Canadian evening, this was a"
1526,ST. ANNE,comforting sight to us. Being four or five feet high it warmed the
1527,ST. ANNE,whole person as you stood by it. The stove was plainly a very
1528,ST. ANNE,"important article of furniture in Canada, and was not set aside during"
1529,ST. ANNE,"the summer. Its size, and the respect which was paid to it, told of"
1530,ST. ANNE,the severe winters which it had seen and prevailed over. The master of
1531,ST. ANNE,"the house, in his long-pointed red woolen cap, had a thoroughly"
1532,ST. ANNE,antique physiognomy of the old Norman stamp. He might have come over
1533,ST. ANNE,with Jacques Cartier. His was the hardest French to understand of any
1534,ST. ANNE,"we had heard yet, for there was a great difference between one speaker"
1535,ST. ANNE,"and another, and this man talked with a pipe in his mouth beside,--a"
1536,ST. ANNE,kind of tobacco French. I asked him what he called his dog. He shouted
1537,ST. ANNE,_Brock_! (the name of the breed). We like to hear the cat called
1538,ST. ANNE,"_min_, ""Min! min! min!"" I inquired if we could cross the river here to"
1539,ST. ANNE,"the Isle of Orleans, thinking to return that way when we had been to"
1540,ST. ANNE,"the falls. He answered, ""S'il ne fait pas un trop grand vent"" (If"
1541,ST. ANNE,"there is not too much wind). They use small boats, or pirogues, and"
1542,ST. ANNE,"the waves are often too high for them. He wore, as usual, something"
1543,ST. ANNE,"between a moccasin and a boot, which he called _bottes Indiennes_,"
1544,ST. ANNE,"Indian boots, and had made himself. The tops were of calf or"
1545,ST. ANNE,"sheepskin, and the soles of cowhide turned up like a moccasin. They"
1546,ST. ANNE,"were yellow or reddish, the leather never having been tanned nor"
1547,ST. ANNE,colored. The women wore the same. He told us that he had traveled ten
1548,ST. ANNE,"leagues due north into the bush. He had been to the Falls of St. Anne,"
1549,ST. ANNE,"and said that they were more beautiful, but not greater, than"
1550,ST. ANNE,"Montmorenci, _plus beau, mais non plus grand, que Montmorenci_. As"
1551,ST. ANNE,"soon as we had retired, the family commenced their devotions. A little"
1552,ST. ANNE,"boy officiated, and for a long time we heard him muttering over his"
1553,ST. ANNE,prayers.
1554,ST. ANNE,
1555,ST. ANNE,"In the morning, after a breakfast of tea, maple-sugar, bread and"
1556,ST. ANNE,"butter, and what I suppose is called _potage_ (potatoes and meat"
1557,ST. ANNE,"boiled with flour), the universal dish as we found, perhaps the"
1558,ST. ANNE,"national one, I ran over to the Church of La Bonne Ste. Anne, whose"
1559,ST. ANNE,"matin bell we had heard, it being Sunday morning. Our book said that"
1560,ST. ANNE,"this church had ""long been an object of interest, from the miraculous"
1561,ST. ANNE,"cures said to have been wrought on visitors to the shrine."" There was"
1562,ST. ANNE,"a profusion of gilding, and I counted more than twenty-five crutches"
1563,ST. ANNE,"suspended on the walls, some for grown persons, some for children,"
1564,ST. ANNE,which it was to be inferred so many sick had been able to dispense
1565,ST. ANNE,with; but they looked as if they had been made to order by the
1566,ST. ANNE,carpenter who made the church. There were one or two villagers at
1567,ST. ANNE,"their devotions at that early hour, who did not look up, but when they"
1568,ST. ANNE,had sat a long time with their little book before the picture of one
1569,ST. ANNE,"saint, went to another. Our whole walk was through a thoroughly"
1570,ST. ANNE,"Catholic country, and there was no trace of any other religion. I"
1571,ST. ANNE,doubt if there are any more simple and unsophisticated Catholics
1572,ST. ANNE,"anywhere. Emery de Caen, Champlain's contemporary, told the Huguenot"
1573,ST. ANNE,"sailors that ""Monseigneur the Duke de Ventadour (Viceroy) did not wish"
1574,ST. ANNE,"that they should sing psalms in the Great River."""
1575,ST. ANNE,
1576,ST. ANNE,"On our way to the falls, we met the habitans coming to the Church of"
1577,ST. ANNE,"La Bonne Ste. Anne, walking or riding in charettes by families. I"
1578,ST. ANNE,remarked that they were universally of small stature. The toll-man at
1579,ST. ANNE,"the bridge over the St. Anne was the first man we had chanced to meet,"
1580,ST. ANNE,"since we left Quebec, who could speak a word of English. How good"
1581,ST. ANNE,"French the inhabitants of this part of Canada speak, I am not"
1582,ST. ANNE,competent to say; I only know that it is not made impure by being
1583,ST. ANNE,mixed with English. I do not know why it should not be as good as is
1584,ST. ANNE,"spoken in Normandy. Charlevoix, who was here a hundred years ago,"
1585,ST. ANNE,"observes, ""The French language is nowhere spoken with greater purity,"
1586,ST. ANNE,"there being no accent perceptible;"" and Potherie said ""they had no"
1587,ST. ANNE,"dialect, which, indeed, is generally lost in a colony."""
1588,ST. ANNE,
1589,ST. ANNE,"The falls, which we were in search of, are three miles up the St."
1590,ST. ANNE,Anne. We followed for a short distance a foot-path up the east bank of
1591,ST. ANNE,"this river, through handsome sugar maple and arbor-vitæ groves. Having"
1592,ST. ANNE,lost the path which led to a house where we were to get further
1593,ST. ANNE,"directions, we dashed at once into the woods, steering by guess and by"
1594,ST. ANNE,"compass, climbing directly through woods a steep hill, or mountain,"
1595,ST. ANNE,"five or six hundred feet high, which was, in fact, only the bank of"
1596,ST. ANNE,"the St. Lawrence. Beyond this we by good luck fell into another path,"
1597,ST. ANNE,"and following this or a branch of it, at our discretion, through a"
1598,ST. ANNE,"forest consisting of large white pines,--the first we had seen in our"
1599,ST. ANNE,"walk,--we at length heard the roar of falling water, and came out at"
1600,ST. ANNE,the head of the Falls of St. Anne. We had descended into a ravine or
1601,ST. ANNE,"cleft in the mountain, whose walls rose still a hundred feet above us,"
1602,ST. ANNE,"though we were near its top, and we now stood on a very rocky shore,"
1603,ST. ANNE,"where the water had lately flowed a dozen feet higher, as appeared by"
1604,ST. ANNE,"the stones and driftwood, and large birches twisted and splintered as"
1605,ST. ANNE,"a farmer twists a withe. Here the river, one or two hundred feet wide,"
1606,ST. ANNE,came flowing rapidly over a rocky bed out of that interesting
1607,ST. ANNE,wilderness which stretches toward Hudson's Bay and Davis's Straits.
1608,ST. ANNE,"Ha-ha Bay, on the Saguenay, was about one hundred miles north of where"
1609,ST. ANNE,"we stood. Looking on the map, I find that the first country on the"
1610,ST. ANNE,north which bears a name is that part of Rupert's Land called East
1611,ST. ANNE,"Main. This river, called after the holy Anne, flowing from such a"
1612,ST. ANNE,"direction, here tumbled over a precipice, at present by three"
1613,ST. ANNE,"channels, how far down I do not know, but far enough for all our"
1614,ST. ANNE,"purposes, and to as good a distance as if twice as far. It matters"
1615,ST. ANNE,"little whether you call it one, or two, or three hundred feet; at any"
1616,ST. ANNE,"rate, it was a sufficient water privilege for us. I crossed the"
1617,ST. ANNE,"principal channel directly over the verge of the fall, where it was"
1618,ST. ANNE,"contracted to about fifteen feet in width, by a dead tree which had"
1619,ST. ANNE,"been dropped across and secured in a cleft of the opposite rock, and"
1620,ST. ANNE,"a smaller one a few feet higher, which served for a hand-rail. This"
1621,ST. ANNE,"bridge was rotten as well as small and slippery, being stripped of"
1622,ST. ANNE,"bark, and I was obliged to seize a moment to pass when the falling"
1623,ST. ANNE,"water did not surge over it, and midway, though at the expense of wet"
1624,ST. ANNE,"feet, I looked down probably more than a hundred feet, into the mist"
1625,ST. ANNE,and foam below. This gave me the freedom of an island of precipitous
1626,ST. ANNE,"rock by which I descended as by giant steps,--the rock being composed"
1627,ST. ANNE,"of large cubical masses, clothed with delicate close-hugging lichens"
1628,ST. ANNE,"of various colors, kept fresh and bright by the moisture,--till I"
1629,ST. ANNE,"viewed the first fall from the front, and looked down still deeper to"
1630,ST. ANNE,where the second and third channels fell into a remarkably large
1631,ST. ANNE,circular basin worn in the stone. The falling water seemed to jar the
1632,ST. ANNE,"very rocks, and the noise to be ever increasing. The vista down-stream"
1633,ST. ANNE,"was through a narrow and deep cleft in the mountain, all white suds at"
1634,ST. ANNE,the bottom; but a sudden angle in this gorge prevented my seeing
1635,ST. ANNE,"through to the bottom of the fall. Returning to the shore, I made my"
1636,ST. ANNE,"way down-stream through the forest to see how far the fall extended,"
1637,ST. ANNE,and how the river came out of that adventure. It was to clamber along
1638,ST. ANNE,"the side of a precipitous mountain of loose mossy rocks, covered with"
1639,ST. ANNE,"a damp primitive forest, and terminating at the bottom in an abrupt"
1640,ST. ANNE,precipice over the stream. This was the east side of the fall. At
1641,ST. ANNE,"length, after a quarter of a mile, I got down to still water, and, on"
1642,ST. ANNE,"looking up through the winding gorge, I could just see to the foot of"
1643,ST. ANNE,the fall which I had before examined; while from the opposite side of
1644,ST. ANNE,"the stream, here much contracted, rose a perpendicular wall, I will"
1645,ST. ANNE,"not venture to say how many hundred feet, but only that it was the"
1646,ST. ANNE,highest perpendicular wall of bare rock that I ever saw. In front of
1647,ST. ANNE,"me tumbled in from the summit of the cliff a tributary stream, making"
1648,ST. ANNE,"a beautiful cascade, which was a remarkable fall in itself, and there"
1649,ST. ANNE,"was a cleft in this precipice, apparently four or five feet wide,"
1650,ST. ANNE,"perfectly straight up and down from top to bottom, which, from its"
1651,ST. ANNE,"cavernous depth and darkness, appeared merely as _a black streak_."
1652,ST. ANNE,"This precipice is not sloped, nor is the material soft and crumbling"
1653,ST. ANNE,"slate as at Montmorenci, but it rises perpendicular, like the side of"
1654,ST. ANNE,"a mountain fortress, and is cracked into vast cubical masses of gray"
1655,ST. ANNE,"and black rock shining with moisture, as if it were the ruin of an"
1656,ST. ANNE,"ancient wall built by Titans. Birches, spruces, mountain-ashes with"
1657,ST. ANNE,"their bright red berries, arbor-vitæs, white pines, alders, etc.,"
1658,ST. ANNE,overhung this chasm on the very verge of the cliff and in the
1659,ST. ANNE,"crevices, and here and there were buttresses of rock supporting trees"
1660,ST. ANNE,"part way down, yet so as to enhance, not injure, the effect of the"
1661,ST. ANNE,"bare rock. Take it altogether, it was a most wild and rugged and"
1662,ST. ANNE,"stupendous chasm, so deep and narrow, where a river had worn itself a"
1663,ST. ANNE,"passage through a mountain of rock, and all around was the"
1664,ST. ANNE,comparatively untrodden wilderness.
1665,ST. ANNE,
1666,ST. ANNE,This was the limit of our walk down the St. Lawrence. Early in the
1667,ST. ANNE,"afternoon we began to retrace our steps, not being able to cross the"
1668,ST. ANNE,"north channel and return by the Isle of Orleans, on account of the"
1669,ST. ANNE,"_trop grand vent_, or too great wind. Though the waves did run pretty"
1670,ST. ANNE,"high, it was evident that the inhabitants of Montmorenci County were"
1671,ST. ANNE,"no sailors, and made but little use of the river. When we reached the"
1672,ST. ANNE,"bridge between St. Anne and Château Richer, I ran back a little way to"
1673,ST. ANNE,"ask a man in the field the name of the river which we were crossing,"
1674,ST. ANNE,"but for a long time I could not make out what he said, for he was one"
1675,ST. ANNE,of the more unintelligible Jacques Cartier men. At last it flashed
1676,ST. ANNE,"upon me that it was _La Rivière au Chien_, or the Dog River, which my"
1677,ST. ANNE,"eyes beheld, which brought to my mind the life of the Canadian"
1678,ST. ANNE,"voyageur and _coureur de bois_, a more western and wilder Arcadia,"
1679,ST. ANNE,"methinks, than the world has ever seen; for the Greeks, with all their"
1680,ST. ANNE,"wood and river gods, were not so qualified to name the natural"
1681,ST. ANNE,features of a country as the ancestors of these French Canadians; and
1682,ST. ANNE,if any people had a right to substitute their own for the Indian
1683,ST. ANNE,"names, it was they. They have preceded the pioneer on our own"
1684,ST. ANNE,"frontiers, and named the _prairie_ for us. _La Rivière au Chien_"
1685,ST. ANNE,"cannot, by any license of language, be translated into Dog River, for"
1686,ST. ANNE,"that is not such a giving it to the dogs, and recognizing their place"
1687,ST. ANNE,"in creation, as the French implies. One of the tributaries of the St."
1688,ST. ANNE,Anne is named _La Rivière de la Rose_; and farther east are _La
1689,ST. ANNE,Rivière de la Blondelle_ and _La Rivière de la Friponne_. Their very
1690,ST. ANNE,_rivière_ meanders more than our _river_.
1691,ST. ANNE,
1692,ST. ANNE,Yet the impression which this country made on me was commonly
1693,ST. ANNE,"different from this. To a traveler from the Old World, Canada East may"
1694,ST. ANNE,"appear like a new country, and its inhabitants like colonists, but to"
1695,ST. ANNE,"me, coming from New England and being a very green traveler"
1696,ST. ANNE,"withal,--notwithstanding what I have said about Hudson's Bay,--it"
1697,ST. ANNE,"appeared as old as Normandy itself, and realized much that I had heard"
1698,ST. ANNE,of Europe and the Middle Ages. Even the names of humble Canadian
1699,ST. ANNE,villages affected me as if they had been those of the renowned cities
1700,ST. ANNE,"of antiquity. To be told by a habitan, when I asked the name of a"
1701,ST. ANNE,"village in sight, that it is _St. Feréol_ or _St. Anne_, the _Guardian"
1702,ST. ANNE,"Angel_ or the _Holy Joseph's_; or of a mountain, that it was _Bélange_"
1703,ST. ANNE,"or _St. Hyacinthe_! As soon as you leave the States, these saintly"
1704,ST. ANNE,names begin. _St. Johns_ is the first town you stop at (fortunately we
1705,ST. ANNE,"did not see it), and thenceforward, the names of the mountains, and"
1706,ST. ANNE,"streams, and villages reel, if I may so speak, with the intoxication"
1707,ST. ANNE,"of poetry,--_Chambly_, _Longueuil_, _Pointe aux Trembles_,"
1708,ST. ANNE,"_Bartholomy_, etc., etc.; as if it needed only a little foreign"
1709,ST. ANNE,"accent, a few more liquids and vowels perchance in the language, to"
1710,ST. ANNE,make us locate our ideals at once. I began to dream of Provence and
1711,ST. ANNE,"the Troubadours, and of places and things which have no existence on"
1712,ST. ANNE,"the earth. They veiled the Indian and the primitive forest, and the"
1713,ST. ANNE,woods toward Hudson's Bay were only as the forests of France and
1714,ST. ANNE,Germany. I could not at once bring myself to believe that the
1715,ST. ANNE,"inhabitants who pronounced daily those beautiful and, to me,"
1716,ST. ANNE,significant names lead as prosaic lives as we of New England. In
1717,ST. ANNE,"short, the Canada which I saw was not merely a place for railroads to"
1718,ST. ANNE,terminate in and for criminals to run to.
1719,ST. ANNE,
1720,ST. ANNE,"When I asked the man to whom I have referred, if there were any falls"
1721,ST. ANNE,"on the Rivière au Chien,--for I saw that it came over the same high"
1722,ST. ANNE,"bank with the Montmorenci and St. Anne,--he answered that there were."
1723,ST. ANNE,"How far? I inquired. ""Trois quatres lieue."" How high? ""Je"
1724,ST. ANNE,"pense-quatre-vingt-dix pieds;"" that is, ninety feet. We turned aside"
1725,ST. ANNE,"to look at the falls of the Rivière du Sault à la Puce, half a mile"
1726,ST. ANNE,"from the road, which before we had passed in our haste and ignorance,"
1727,ST. ANNE,and we pronounced them as beautiful as any that we saw; yet they
1728,ST. ANNE,"seemed to make no account of them there, and, when first we inquired"
1729,ST. ANNE,"the way to the falls, directed us to Montmorenci, seven miles distant."
1730,ST. ANNE,It was evident that this was the country for waterfalls; that every
1731,ST. ANNE,"stream that empties into the St. Lawrence, for some hundreds of miles,"
1732,ST. ANNE,"must have a great fall or cascade on it, and in its passage through"
1733,ST. ANNE,"the mountains was, for a short distance, a small Saguenay, with its"
1734,ST. ANNE,"upright walls. This fall of La Puce, the least remarkable of the four"
1735,ST. ANNE,"which we visited in this vicinity, we had never heard of till we came"
1736,ST. ANNE,"to Canada, and yet, so far as I know, there is nothing of the kind in"
1737,ST. ANNE,New England to be compared with it. Most travelers in Canada would not
1738,ST. ANNE,"hear of it, though they might go so near as to hear it. Since my"
1739,ST. ANNE,return I find that in the topographical description of the country
1740,ST. ANNE,"mention is made of ""two or three romantic falls"" on this stream,"
1741,ST. ANNE,though we saw and heard of but this one. Ask the inhabitants
1742,ST. ANNE,"respecting any stream, if there is a fall on it, and they will"
1743,ST. ANNE,perchance tell you of something as interesting as Bashpish or the
1744,ST. ANNE,"Catskill, which no traveler has ever seen, or if they have not found"
1745,ST. ANNE,"it, you may possibly trace up the stream and discover it yourself."
1746,ST. ANNE,"Falls there are a drug, and we became quite dissipated in respect to"
1747,ST. ANNE,them. We had drank too much of them. Beside these which I have
1748,ST. ANNE,"referred to, there are a thousand other falls on the St. Lawrence and"
1749,ST. ANNE,its tributaries which I have not seen nor heard of; and above all
1750,ST. ANNE,"there is one which I have heard of, called Niagara, so that I think"
1751,ST. ANNE,that this river must be the most remarkable for its falls of any in
1752,ST. ANNE,the world.
1753,ST. ANNE,
1754,ST. ANNE,"At a house near the western boundary of Château Richer, whose master"
1755,ST. ANNE,"was said to speak a very little English, having recently lived at"
1756,ST. ANNE,"Quebec, we got lodging for the night. As usual, we had to go down a"
1757,ST. ANNE,"lane to get round to the south side of the house, where the door was,"
1758,ST. ANNE,"away from the road. For these Canadian houses have no front door,"
1759,ST. ANNE,properly speaking. Every part is for the use of the occupant
1760,ST. ANNE,"exclusively, and no part has reference to the traveler or to travel."
1761,ST. ANNE,"Every New England house, on the contrary, has a front and principal"
1762,ST. ANNE,"door opening to the great world, though it may be on the cold side,"
1763,ST. ANNE,"for it stands on the highway of nations, and the road which runs by it"
1764,ST. ANNE,comes from the Old World and goes to the far West; but the Canadian's
1765,ST. ANNE,"door opens into his backyard and farm alone, and the road which runs"
1766,ST. ANNE,behind his house leads only from the church of one saint to that of
1767,ST. ANNE,"another. We found a large family, hired men, wife, and children, just"
1768,ST. ANNE,eating their supper. They prepared some for us afterwards. The hired
1769,ST. ANNE,"men were a merry crew of short, black-eyed fellows, and the wife a"
1770,ST. ANNE,"thin-faced, sharp-featured French-Canadian woman. Our host's English"
1771,ST. ANNE,"staggered us rather more than any French we had heard yet; indeed, we"
1772,ST. ANNE,"found that even we spoke better French than he did English, and we"
1773,ST. ANNE,concluded that a less crime would be committed on the whole if we
1774,ST. ANNE,"spoke French with him, and in no respect aided or abetted his attempts"
1775,ST. ANNE,to speak English. We had a long and merry chat with the family this
1776,ST. ANNE,Sunday evening in their spacious kitchen. While my companion smoked a
1777,ST. ANNE,"pipe and parlez-vous'd with one party, I parleyed and gesticulated to"
1778,ST. ANNE,"another. The whole family was enlisted, and I kept a little girl"
1779,ST. ANNE,writing what was otherwise unintelligible. The geography getting
1780,ST. ANNE,"obscure, we called for chalk, and the greasy oiled table-cloth having"
1781,ST. ANNE,"been wiped,--for it needed no French, but only a sentence from the"
1782,ST. ANNE,"universal language of looks on my part, to indicate that it needed"
1783,ST. ANNE,"it,--we drew the St. Lawrence, with its parishes, thereon, and"
1784,ST. ANNE,"thenceforward went on swimmingly, by turns handling the chalk and"
1785,ST. ANNE,committing to the table-cloth what would otherwise have been left in a
1786,ST. ANNE,limbo of unintelligibility. This was greatly to the entertainment of
1787,ST. ANNE,all parties. I was amused to hear how much use they made of the word
1788,ST. ANNE,oui in conversation with one another. After repeated single insertions
1789,ST. ANNE,"of it, one would suddenly throw back his head at the same time with"
1790,ST. ANNE,"his chair, and exclaim rapidly, ""Oui! oui! oui! oui!"" like a Yankee"
1791,ST. ANNE,driving pigs. Our host told us that the farms thereabouts were
1792,ST. ANNE,"generally two acres or three hundred and sixty French feet wide, by"
1793,ST. ANNE,"one and a half leagues (?), or a little more than four and a half of"
1794,ST. ANNE,our miles deep. This use of the word _acre_ as long measure arises
1795,ST. ANNE,"from the fact that the French acre or arpent, the arpent of Paris,"
1796,ST. ANNE,"makes a square of ten perches, of eighteen feet each, on a side, a"
1797,ST. ANNE,Paris foot being equal to 1.06575 English feet. He said that the wood
1798,ST. ANNE,"was cut off about one mile from the river. The rest was ""bush,"" and"
1799,ST. ANNE,"beyond that the ""Queen's bush."" Old as the country is, each landholder"
1800,ST. ANNE,"bounds on the primitive forest, and fuel bears no price. As I had"
1801,ST. ANNE,"forgotten the French for _sickle_, they went out in the evening to the"
1802,ST. ANNE,"barn and got one, and so clenched the certainty of our understanding"
1803,ST. ANNE,"one another. Then, wishing to learn if they used the cradle, and not"
1804,ST. ANNE,"knowing any French word for this instrument, I set up the knives and"
1805,ST. ANNE,forks on the blade of the sickle to represent one; at which they all
1806,ST. ANNE,exclaimed that they knew and had used it. When _snells_ were mentioned
1807,ST. ANNE,they went out in the dark and plucked some. They were pretty good.
1808,ST. ANNE,"They said they had three kinds of plums growing wild,--blue, white,"
1809,ST. ANNE,"and red, the two former much alike and the best. Also they asked me if"
1810,ST. ANNE,"I would have _des pommes_, some apples, and got me some. They were"
1811,ST. ANNE,"exceedingly fair and glossy, and it was evident that there was no worm"
1812,ST. ANNE,"in them; but they were as hard almost as a stone, as if the season was"
1813,ST. ANNE,too short to mellow them. We had seen no soft and yellow apples by the
1814,ST. ANNE,"roadside. I declined eating one, much as I admired it, observing that"
1815,ST. ANNE,"it would be good _dans le printemps_, in the spring. In the morning"
1816,ST. ANNE,"when the mistress had set the eggs a-frying she nodded to a thick-set,"
1817,ST. ANNE,"jolly-looking fellow, who rolled up his sleeves, seized the"
1818,ST. ANNE,"long-handled griddle, and commenced a series of revolutions and"
1819,ST. ANNE,"evolutions with it, ever and anon tossing its contents into the air,"
1820,ST. ANNE,where they turned completely topsy-turvy and came down t'other side
1821,ST. ANNE,up; and this he repeated till they were done. That appeared to be his
1822,ST. ANNE,duty when eggs were concerned. I did not chance to witness this
1823,ST. ANNE,"performance, but my companion did, and he pronounced it a masterpiece"
1824,ST. ANNE,"in its way. This man's farm, with the buildings, cost seven hundred"
1825,ST. ANNE,"pounds; some smaller ones, two hundred."
1826,ST. ANNE,
1827,ST. ANNE,"In 1827, Montmorenci County, to which the Isle of Orleans has since"
1828,ST. ANNE,"been added, was nearly as large as Massachusetts, being the eighth"
1829,ST. ANNE,county out of forty (in Lower Canada) in extent; but by far the
1830,ST. ANNE,"greater part still must continue to be waste land, lying as it were"
1831,ST. ANNE,under the walls of Quebec.
1832,ST. ANNE,
1833,ST. ANNE,"I quote these old statistics, not merely because of the difficulty of"
1834,ST. ANNE,"obtaining more recent ones, but also because I saw there so little"
1835,ST. ANNE,"evidence of any recent growth. There were in this county, at the same"
1836,ST. ANNE,"date, five Roman Catholic churches, and no others, five cures and five"
1837,ST. ANNE,"presbyteries, two schools, two corn-mills, four sawmills, one"
1838,ST. ANNE,"carding-mill,--no medical man or notary or lawyer,--five shopkeepers,"
1839,ST. ANNE,"four taverns (we saw no sign of any, though, after a little"
1840,ST. ANNE,"hesitation, we were sometimes directed to some undistinguished hut as"
1841,ST. ANNE,"such), thirty artisans, and five river crafts, whose tonnage amounted"
1842,ST. ANNE,"to sixty-nine tons! This, notwithstanding that it has a frontage of"
1843,ST. ANNE,"more than thirty miles on the river, and the population is almost"
1844,ST. ANNE,wholly confined to its banks. This describes nearly enough what we
1845,ST. ANNE,"saw. But double some of these figures, which, however, its growth will"
1846,ST. ANNE,"not warrant, and you have described a poverty which not even its"
1847,ST. ANNE,severity of climate and ruggedness of soil will suffice to account
1848,ST. ANNE,"for. The principal productions were wheat, potatoes, oats, hay, peas,"
1849,ST. ANNE,"flax, maple-sugar, etc., etc.; linen cloth, or _étoffe du pays_,"
1850,ST. ANNE,"flannel, and homespun, or _petite étoffe_."
1851,ST. ANNE,
1852,ST. ANNE,"In Lower Canada, according to Bouchette, there are two tenures,--the"
1853,ST. ANNE,"feudal and the socage. _Tenanciers_, _censitaires_, or holders of land"
1854,ST. ANNE,"_en roture_ pay a small annual rent to the seigneurs, to which ""is"
1855,ST. ANNE,"added some articles of provision, such as a couple of fowls, or a"
1856,ST. ANNE,"goose, or a bushel of wheat."" ""They are also bound to grind their corn"
1857,ST. ANNE,"at the _moulin banal_, or the lord's mill, where one fourteenth part"
1858,ST. ANNE,"of it is taken for his use"" as toll. He says that the toll is one"
1859,ST. ANNE,twelfth in the United States where competition exists. It is not
1860,ST. ANNE,permitted to exceed one sixteenth in Massachusetts. But worse than
1861,ST. ANNE,"this monopolizing of mill rents is what are called _lods et ventes_,"
1862,ST. ANNE,"or mutation fines,--according to which the seigneur has ""a right to a"
1863,ST. ANNE,twelfth part of the purchase-money of every estate within his
1864,ST. ANNE,"seigniory that changes its owner by sale."" This is over and above the"
1865,ST. ANNE,"sum paid to the seller. In such cases, moreover, ""the lord possesses"
1866,ST. ANNE,"the _droit de retrait_, which is the privilege of preemption at the"
1867,ST. ANNE,highest bidden price within forty days after the sale has taken
1868,ST. ANNE,"place,""--a right which, however, is said to be seldom exercised."
1869,ST. ANNE,"""Lands held by Roman Catholics are further subject to the payment to"
1870,ST. ANNE,their curates of one twenty-sixth part of all the grain produced upon
1871,ST. ANNE,"them, and to occasional assessments for building and repairing"
1872,ST. ANNE,"churches,"" etc.,--a tax to which they are not subject if the"
1873,ST. ANNE,proprietors change their faith; but they are not the less attached to
1874,ST. ANNE,"their church in consequence. There are, however, various modifications"
1875,ST. ANNE,"of the feudal tenure. Under the socage tenure, which is that of the"
1876,ST. ANNE,"townships or more recent settlements, English, Irish, Scotch, and"
1877,ST. ANNE,"others, and generally of Canada West, the landholder is wholly"
1878,ST. ANNE,"unshackled by such conditions as I have quoted, and ""is bound to no"
1879,ST. ANNE,other obligations than those of allegiance to the king and obedience
1880,ST. ANNE,"to the laws."" Throughout Canada ""a freehold of forty shillings yearly"
1881,ST. ANNE,"value, or the payment of ten pounds rent annually, is the"
1882,ST. ANNE,"qualification for voters."" In 1846 more than one sixth of the whole"
1883,ST. ANNE,population of Canada East were qualified to vote for members of
1884,ST. ANNE,"Parliament,--a greater proportion than enjoy a similar privilege in"
1885,ST. ANNE,the United States.
1886,ST. ANNE,
1887,ST. ANNE,The population which we had seen the last two days--I mean the
1888,ST. ANNE,"habitans of Montmorenci County--appeared very inferior, intellectually"
1889,ST. ANNE,"and even physically, to that of New England. In some respects they"
1890,ST. ANNE,were incredibly filthy. It was evident that they had not advanced
1891,ST. ANNE,"since the settlement of the country, that they were quite behind the"
1892,ST. ANNE,"age, and fairly represented their ancestors in Normandy a thousand"
1893,ST. ANNE,"years ago. Even in respect to the common arts of life, they are not so"
1894,ST. ANNE,far advanced as a frontier town in the West three years old. They have
1895,ST. ANNE,"no money invested in railroad stock, and probably never will have. If"
1896,ST. ANNE,"they have got a French phrase for a railroad, it is as much as you can"
1897,ST. ANNE,"expect of them. They are very far from a revolution, have no quarrel"
1898,ST. ANNE,"with Church or State, but their vice and their virtue is content. As"
1899,ST. ANNE,"for annexation, they have never dreamed of it; indeed, they have not a"
1900,ST. ANNE,clear idea what or where the States are. The English government has
1901,ST. ANNE,"been remarkably liberal to its Catholic subjects in Canada, permitting"
1902,ST. ANNE,"them to wear their own fetters, both political and religious, as far"
1903,ST. ANNE,as was possible for subjects. Their government is even too good for
1904,ST. ANNE,"them. Parliament passed ""an act [in 1825] to provide for the"
1905,ST. ANNE,extinction of feudal and seigniorial rights and burdens on lands in
1906,ST. ANNE,"Lower Canada, and for the gradual conversion of those tenures into the"
1907,ST. ANNE,"tenure of free and common socage,"" etc. But as late as 1831, at least,"
1908,ST. ANNE,"the design of the act was likely to be frustrated, owing to the"
1909,ST. ANNE,reluctance of the seigniors and peasants. It has been observed by
1910,ST. ANNE,another that the French Canadians do not extend nor perpetuate their
1911,ST. ANNE,"influence. The British, Irish, and other immigrants, who have settled"
1912,ST. ANNE,"the townships, are found to have imitated the American settlers and"
1913,ST. ANNE,"not the French. They reminded me in this of the Indians, whom they"
1914,ST. ANNE,"were slow to displace, and to whose habits of life they themselves more"
1915,ST. ANNE,readily conformed than the Indians to theirs. The Governor-General
1916,ST. ANNE,"Denouville remarked, in 1685, that some had long thought that it was"
1917,ST. ANNE,necessary to bring the Indians near them in order to Frenchify
1918,ST. ANNE,"(_franciser_) them, but that they had every reason to think themselves"
1919,ST. ANNE,in an error; for those who had come near them and were even collected
1920,ST. ANNE,"in villages in the midst of the colony had not become French, but the"
1921,ST. ANNE,"French who had haunted them had become savages. Kalm said, ""Though"
1922,ST. ANNE,"many nations imitate the French customs, yet I observed, on the"
1923,ST. ANNE,"contrary, that the French in Canada, in many respects, follow the"
1924,ST. ANNE,"customs of the Indians, with whom they converse every day. They make"
1925,ST. ANNE,"use of the tobacco-pipes, shoes, garters, and girdles of the Indians."
1926,ST. ANNE,They follow the Indian way of making war with exactness; they mix the
1927,ST. ANNE,same things with tobacco [he might have said that both French and
1928,ST. ANNE,English learned the use itself of this weed of the Indian]; they make
1929,ST. ANNE,"use of the Indian bark-boats, and row them in the Indian way; they"
1930,ST. ANNE,wrap square pieces of cloth round their feet instead of stockings; and
1931,ST. ANNE,"have adopted many other Indian fashions."" Thus, while the descendants"
1932,ST. ANNE,"of the Pilgrims are teaching the English to make pegged boots, the"
1933,ST. ANNE,descendants of the French in Canada are wearing the Indian moccasin
1934,ST. ANNE,"still. The French, to their credit be it said, to a certain extent"
1935,ST. ANNE,"respected the Indians as a separate and independent people, and spoke"
1936,ST. ANNE,of them and contrasted themselves with them as the English have never
1937,ST. ANNE,"done. They not only went to war with them as allies, but they lived at"
1938,ST. ANNE,"home with them as neighbors. In 1627 the French king declared ""that"
1939,ST. ANNE,"the descendants"" of the French, settled in New France, ""and the"
1940,ST. ANNE,"savages who should be brought to the knowledge of the faith, and"
1941,ST. ANNE,"should make profession of it, should be counted and reputed French"
1942,ST. ANNE,"born (_Naturels François_); and as such could emigrate to France, when"
1943,ST. ANNE,"it seemed good to them, and there acquire, will, inherit, etc., etc.,"
1944,ST. ANNE,"without obtaining letters of naturalization."" When the English had"
1945,ST. ANNE,"possession of Quebec, in 1630, the Indians, attempting to practice the"
1946,ST. ANNE,"same familiarity with them that they had with the French, were driven"
1947,ST. ANNE,out of their houses with blows; which accident taught them a
1948,ST. ANNE,"difference between the two races, and attached them yet more to the"
1949,ST. ANNE,French. The impression made on me was that the French Canadians were
1950,ST. ANNE,"even sharing the fate of the Indians, or at least gradually"
1951,ST. ANNE,disappearing in what is called the Saxon current.
1952,ST. ANNE,
1953,ST. ANNE,"The English did not come to America from a mere love of adventure,"
1954,ST. ANNE,"nor to truck with or convert the savages, nor to hold offices under"
1955,ST. ANNE,"the crown, as the French to a great extent did, but to live in earnest"
1956,ST. ANNE,"and with freedom. The latter overran a great extent of country,"
1957,ST. ANNE,"selling strong water, and collecting its furs, and converting its"
1958,ST. ANNE,"inhabitants,--or at least baptizing its dying infants (_enfans"
1959,ST. ANNE,"moribonds_),--without _improving_ it. First went the _coureur de bois_"
1960,ST. ANNE,"with the _eau de vie_; then followed, if he did not precede, the"
1961,ST. ANNE,heroic missionary with the _eau d'immortalité_. It was freedom to
1962,ST. ANNE,"hunt, and fish, and convert, not to work, that they sought. Hontan"
1963,ST. ANNE,says that the _coureurs de bois_ lived like sailors ashore. In no part
1964,ST. ANNE,of the Seventeenth Century could the French be said to have had a
1965,ST. ANNE,foothold in Canada; they held only by the fur of the wild animals
1966,ST. ANNE,which they were exterminating. To enable the poor seigneurs to get
1967,ST. ANNE,"their living, it was permitted by a decree passed in the reign of"
1968,ST. ANNE,"Louis the Fourteenth, in 1685, ""to all nobles and gentlemen settled in"
1969,ST. ANNE,"Canada, to engage in commerce, without being called to account or"
1970,ST. ANNE,"reputed to have done anything derogatory."" The reader can infer to"
1971,ST. ANNE,"what extent they had engaged in agriculture, and how their farms must"
1972,ST. ANNE,"have shone by this time. The New England youth, on the other hand,"
1973,ST. ANNE,"were never _coureurs de bois_ nor _voyageurs_, but backwoodsmen and"
1974,ST. ANNE,sailors rather. Of all nations the English undoubtedly have proved
1975,ST. ANNE,hitherto that they had the most business here.
1976,ST. ANNE,
1977,ST. ANNE,Yet I am not sure but I have most sympathy with that spirit of adventure
1978,ST. ANNE,"which distinguished the French and Spaniards of those days, and made"
1979,ST. ANNE,"them especially the explorers of the American Continent,--which so"
1980,ST. ANNE,early carried the former to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi on the
1981,ST. ANNE,"north, and the latter to the same river on the south. It was long"
1982,ST. ANNE,before our frontiers reached their settlements in the West. So far as
1983,ST. ANNE,"inland discovery was concerned, the adventurous spirit of the English"
1984,ST. ANNE,"was that of sailors who land but for a day, and their enterprise the"
1985,ST. ANNE,enterprise of traders.
1986,ST. ANNE,
1987,ST. ANNE,There was apparently a greater equality of condition among the
1988,ST. ANNE,habitans of Montmorenci County than in New England. They are an almost
1989,ST. ANNE,"exclusively agricultural, and so far independent population, each"
1990,ST. ANNE,family producing nearly all the necessaries of life for itself. If the
1991,ST. ANNE,"Canadian wants energy, perchance he possesses those virtues, social"
1992,ST. ANNE,"and others, which the Yankee lacks, in which case he cannot be"
1993,ST. ANNE,regarded as a poor man.

2011,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,
2012,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"After spending the night at a farmhouse in Château Richer, about a"
2013,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"dozen miles northeast of Quebec, we set out on our return to the city."
2014,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"We stopped at the next house, a picturesque old stone mill, over the"
2015,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"_Chipré_,--for so the name sounded,--such as you will nowhere see in"
2016,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the States, and asked the millers the age of the mill. They went"
2017,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,upstairs to call the master; but the crabbed old miser asked why we
2018,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"wanted to know, and would tell us only for some compensation. I wanted"
2019,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,French to give him a piece of my mind. I had got enough to talk on a
2020,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"pinch, but not to quarrel, so I had to come away, looking all I would"
2021,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,have said. This was the utmost incivility we met with in Canada. In
2022,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Beauport, within a few miles of Quebec, we turned aside to look at a"
2023,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"church which was just being completed,--a very large and handsome"
2024,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"edifice of stone, with a green bough stuck in its gable, of some"
2025,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,significance to Catholics. The comparative wealth of the Church in
2026,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,this country was apparent; for in this village we did not see one good
2027,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,house besides. They were all humble cottages; and yet this appeared to
2028,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,me a more imposing structure than any church in Boston. But I am no
2029,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,judge of these things.
2030,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,
2031,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Reëntering Quebec through St. John's Gate, we took a caleche in Market"
2032,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Square for the Falls of the Chaudière, about nine miles southwest of"
2033,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the city, for which we were to pay so much, besides forty sous for"
2034,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"tolls. The driver, as usual, spoke French only. The number of these"
2035,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,vehicles is very great for so small a town. They are like one of our
2036,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"chaises that has lost its top, only stouter and longer in the body,"
2037,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"with a seat for the driver where the dasher is with us, and broad"
2038,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,leather ears on each side to protect the riders from the wheel and
2039,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"keep children from falling out. They had an easy jaunting look, which,"
2040,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"as our hours were numbered, persuaded us to be riders. We met with"
2041,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"them on every road near Quebec these days, each with its complement of"
2042,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"two inquisitive-looking foreigners and a Canadian driver, the former"
2043,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"evidently enjoying their novel experience, for commonly it is only the"
2044,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,horse whose language you do not understand; but they were one remove
2045,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,further from him by the intervention of an equally unintelligible
2046,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,driver. We crossed the St. Lawrence to Point Levi in a French-Canadian
2047,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"ferry-boat, which was inconvenient and dirty, and managed with great"
2048,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,noise and bustle. The current was very strong and tumultuous; and the
2049,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"boat tossed enough to make some sick, though it was only a mile"
2050,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,across; yet the wind was not to be compared with that of the day
2051,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"before, and we saw that the Canadians had a good excuse for not taking"
2052,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"us over to the Isle of Orleans in a pirogue, however shiftless they"
2053,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,may be for not having provided any other conveyance. The route which
2054,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,we took to the Chaudière did not afford us those views of Quebec which
2055,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"we had expected, and the country and inhabitants appeared less"
2056,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,interesting to a traveler than those we had seen. The Falls of the
2057,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,Chaudière are three miles from its mouth on the south side of the St.
2058,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Lawrence. Though they were the largest which I saw in Canada, I was"
2059,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"not proportionately interested by them, probably from satiety. I did"
2060,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"not see any peculiar propriety in the name _Chaudière_, or caldron. I"
2061,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,saw here the most brilliant rainbow that I ever imagined. It was just
2062,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"across the stream below the precipice, formed on the mist which this"
2063,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,tremendous fall produced; and I stood on a level with the keystone of
2064,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"its arch. It was not a few faint prismatic colors merely, but a full"
2065,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"semicircle, only four or five rods in diameter, though as wide as"
2066,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"usual, so intensely bright as to pain the eye, and apparently as"
2067,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,substantial as an arch of stone. It changed its position and colors as
2068,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"we moved, and was the brighter because the sun shone so clearly and"
2069,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,the mist was so thick. Evidently a picture painted on mist for the men
2070,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,and animals that came to the falls to look at; but for what special
2071,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"purpose beyond this, I know not. At the farthest point in this ride,"
2072,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"and when most inland, unexpectedly at a turn in the road we descried"
2073,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the frowning citadel of Quebec in the horizon, like the beak of a bird"
2074,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"of prey. We returned by the river road under the bank, which is very"
2075,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"high, abrupt, and rocky. When we were opposite to Quebec, I was"
2076,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"surprised to see that in the Lower Town, under the shadow of the rock,"
2077,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the lamps were lit, twinkling not unlike crystals in a cavern, while"
2078,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the citadel high above, and we, too, on the south shore, were in broad"
2079,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"daylight. As we were too late for the ferry-boat that night, we put up"
2080,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,at a _maison de pension_ at Point Levi. The usual two-story stove was
2081,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,here placed against an opening in the partition shaped like a
2082,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"fireplace, and so warmed several rooms. We could not understand their"
2083,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"French here very well, but the _potage_ was just like what we had had"
2084,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"before. There were many small chambers with doorways, but no doors."
2085,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"The walls of our chamber, all around and overhead, were neatly ceiled,"
2086,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,and the timbers cased with wood unpainted. The pillows were checkered
2087,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"and tasseled, and the usual long-pointed red woolen or worsted"
2088,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,nightcap was placed on each. I pulled mine out to see how it was made.
2089,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"It was in the form of a double cone, one end tucked into the other;"
2090,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"just such, it appeared, as I saw men wearing all day in the streets."
2091,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Probably I should have put it on if the cold had been then, as it is"
2092,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"sometimes there, thirty or forty degrees below zero."
2093,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,
2094,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,When we landed at Quebec the next morning a man lay on his back on the
2095,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"wharf, apparently dying, in the midst of a crowd and directly in the"
2096,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"path of the horses, groaning, ""O ma conscience!"" I thought that he"
2097,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"pronounced his French more distinctly than any I heard, as if the"
2098,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,dying had already acquired the accents of a universal language. Having
2099,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"secured the only unengaged berths in the Lord Sydenham steamer, which"
2100,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"was to leave Quebec before sundown, and being resolved, now that I had"
2101,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"seen somewhat of the country, to get an idea of the city, I proceeded"
2102,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"to walk round the Upper Town, or fortified portion, which is two miles"
2103,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"and three quarters in circuit, alone, as near as I could get to the"
2104,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"cliff and the walls, like a rat looking for a hole; going round by the"
2105,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"southwest, where there is but a single street between the cliff and"
2106,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the water, and up the long wooden stairs, through the suburbs"
2107,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"northward to the King's Woodyard, which I thought must have been a"
2108,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"long way from his fireplace, and under the cliffs of the St. Charles,"
2109,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"where the drains issue under the walls, and the walls are loopholed"
2110,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,for musketry; so returning by Mountain Street and Prescott Gate to the
2111,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,Upper Town. Having found my way by an obscure passage near the St.
2112,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Louis Gate to the glacis on the north of the citadel proper,--I"
2113,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,believe that I was the only visitor then in the city who got in
2114,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"there,--I enjoyed a prospect nearly as good as from within the citadel"
2115,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"itself, which I had explored some days before. As I walked on the"
2116,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,glacis I heard the sound of a bagpipe from the soldiers' dwellings in
2117,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"the rock, and was further soothed and affected by the sight of a"
2118,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,soldier's cat walking up a cleated plank into a high loophole designed
2119,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"for _mus-catry_, as serene as Wisdom herself, and with a gracefully"
2120,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"waving motion of her tail, as if her ways were ways of pleasantness"
2121,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"and all her paths were peace. Scaling a slat fence, where a small"
2122,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"force might have checked me, I got out of the esplanade into the"
2123,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Governor's Garden, and read the well-known inscription on Wolfe and"
2124,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"Montcalm's monument, which for saying much in little, and that to the"
2125,THE WALLS OF QUEBEC,"purpose, undoubtedly deserved the prize medal which it received:--"

2132,DEDIT,"(Valor gave them one death, history one fame, posterity one monument.)"
2133,DEDIT,"The Government Garden has for nosegays, amid kitchen vegetables,"
2134,DEDIT,"beside the common garden flowers, the usual complement of cannon"
2135,DEDIT,directed toward some future and possible enemy. I then returned up St.
2136,DEDIT,"Louis Street to the esplanade and ramparts there, and went round the"
2137,DEDIT,"Upper Town once more, though I was very tired, this time on the"
2138,DEDIT,_inside_ of the wall; for I knew that the wall was the main thing in
2139,DEDIT,"Quebec, and had cost a great deal of money, and therefore I must make"
2140,DEDIT,"the most of it. In fact, these are the only remarkable walls we have"
2141,DEDIT,"in North America, though we have a good deal of Virginia fence, it is"
2142,DEDIT,"true. Moreover, I cannot say but I yielded in some measure to the"
2143,DEDIT,"soldier instinct, and, having but a short time to spare, thought it"
2144,DEDIT,"best to examine the wall thoroughly, that I might be the better"
2145,DEDIT,prepared if I should ever be called that way again in the service of
2146,DEDIT,"my country. I committed all the gates to memory, in their order, which"
2147,DEDIT,did not cost me so much trouble as it would have done at the
2148,DEDIT,"hundred-gated city, there being only five; nor were they so hard to"
2149,DEDIT,"remember as those seven of Boeotian Thebes; and, moreover, I thought"
2150,DEDIT,"that, if seven champions were enough against the latter, one would be"
2151,DEDIT,"enough against Quebec, though he bore for all armor and device only an"
2152,DEDIT,"umbrella and a bundle. I took the nunneries as I went, for I had"
2153,DEDIT,learned to distinguish them by the blinds; and I observed also the
2154,DEDIT,"foundling hospitals and the convents, and whatever was attached to, or"
2155,DEDIT,"in the vicinity of the walls. All the rest I omitted, as naturally as"
2156,DEDIT,one would the inside of an inedible shell-fish. These were the only
2157,DEDIT,"pearls, and the wall the only mother-of-pearl for me. Quebec is"
2158,DEDIT,chiefly famous for the thickness of its parietal bones. The technical
2159,DEDIT,"terms of its conchology may stagger a beginner a little at first, such"
2160,DEDIT,"as _banlieue_, _esplanade_, _glacis_, _ravelin_, _cavalier_, etc.,"
2161,DEDIT,"etc., but with the aid of a comprehensive dictionary you soon learn"
2162,DEDIT,the nature of your ground. I was surprised at the extent of the
2163,DEDIT,"artillery barracks, built so long ago,--_Casernes Nouvelles_, they"
2164,DEDIT,"used to be called,--nearly six hundred feet in length by forty in"
2165,DEDIT,"depth, where the sentries, like peripatetic philosophers, were so"
2166,DEDIT,absorbed in thought as not to notice me when I passed in and out at
2167,DEDIT,"the gates. Within are ""small arms of every description, sufficient for"
2168,DEDIT,"the equipment of twenty thousand men,"" so arranged as to give a"
2169,DEDIT,"startling _coup d'oeil_ to strangers. I did not enter, not wishing"
2170,DEDIT,"to get a black eye; for they are said to be ""in a state of complete"
2171,DEDIT,"repair and readiness for immediate use."" Here, for a short time, I"
2172,DEDIT,"lost sight of the wall, but I recovered it again on emerging from the"
2173,DEDIT,barrack yard. There I met with a Scotchman who appeared to have
2174,DEDIT,"business with the wall, like myself; and, being thus mutually drawn"
2175,DEDIT,"together by a similarity of tastes, we had a little conversation _sub"
2176,DEDIT,"moenibus_, that is, by an angle of the wall, which sheltered us. He"
2177,DEDIT,lived about thirty miles northwest of Quebec; had been nineteen years
2178,DEDIT,in the country; said he was disappointed that he was not brought to
2179,DEDIT,"America after all, but found himself still under British rule and"
2180,DEDIT,"where his own language was not spoken; that many Scotch, Irish, and"
2181,DEDIT,"English were disappointed in like manner, and either went to the"
2182,DEDIT,"States or pushed up the river to Canada West, nearer to the States,"
2183,DEDIT,and where their language was spoken. He talked of visiting the States
2184,DEDIT,"some time; and, as he seemed ignorant of geography, I warned him that"
2185,DEDIT,"it was one thing to visit the State of Massachusetts, and another to"
2186,DEDIT,visit the State of California. He said it was colder there than usual
2187,DEDIT,"at that season, and he was lucky to have brought his thick togue, or"
2188,DEDIT,"frock-coat, with him; thought it would snow, and then be pleasant and"
2189,DEDIT,"warm. That is the way we are always thinking. However, his words were"
2190,DEDIT,music to me in my thin hat and sack.
2191,DEDIT,
2192,DEDIT,At the ramparts on the cliff near the old Parliament House I counted
2193,DEDIT,"twenty-four thirty-two-pounders in a row, pointed over the harbor,"
2194,DEDIT,"with their balls piled pyramid-wise between them,--there are said to"
2195,DEDIT,"be in all about one hundred and eighty guns mounted at Quebec,--all"
2196,DEDIT,"which were faithfully kept dusted by officials, in accordance with the"
2197,DEDIT,"motto, ""In time of peace prepare for war;"" but I saw no preparations"
2198,DEDIT,for peace: she was plainly an uninvited guest.
2199,DEDIT,
2200,DEDIT,"Having thus completed the circuit of this fortress, both within and"
2201,DEDIT,"without, I went no farther by the wall for fear that I should become"
2202,DEDIT,"wall-eyed. However, I think that I deserve to be made a member of the"
2203,DEDIT,Royal Sappers and Miners.
2204,DEDIT,
2205,DEDIT,"In short, I observed everywhere the most perfect arrangements for"
2206,DEDIT,"keeping a wall in order, not even permitting the lichens to grow on"
2207,DEDIT,"it, which some think an ornament; but then I saw no cultivation nor"
2208,DEDIT,"pasturing within it to pay for the outlay, and cattle were strictly"
2209,DEDIT,forbidden to feed on the glacis under the severest penalties. Where
2210,DEDIT,"the dogs get their milk I don't know, and I fear it is bloody at best."
2211,DEDIT,
2212,DEDIT,"The citadel of Quebec says, ""I _will_ live here, and you shan't"
2213,DEDIT,"prevent me."" To which you return, that you have not the slightest"
2214,DEDIT,"objection; live and let live. The Martello towers looked, for all the"
2215,DEDIT,"world, exactly like abandoned windmills which had not had a grist to"
2216,DEDIT,"grind these hundred years. Indeed, the whole castle here was a"
2217,DEDIT,"""folly,""--England's folly,--and, in more senses than one, a castle in"
2218,DEDIT,the air. The inhabitants and the government are gradually waking up to
2219,DEDIT,a sense of this truth; for I heard something said about their
2220,DEDIT,"abandoning the wall around the Upper Town, and confining the"
2221,DEDIT,fortifications to the citadel of forty acres. Of course they will
2222,DEDIT,finally reduce their intrenchments to the circumference of their own
2223,DEDIT,brave hearts.
2224,DEDIT,
2225,DEDIT,The most modern fortifications have an air of antiquity about them;
2226,DEDIT,they have the aspect of ruins in better or worse repair from the day
2227,DEDIT,"they are built, because they are not really the work of this age. The"
2228,DEDIT,very place where the soldier resides has a peculiar tendency to become
2229,DEDIT,"old and dilapidated, as the word _barrack_ implies. I couple all"
2230,DEDIT,fortifications in my mind with the dismantled Spanish forts to be
2231,DEDIT,found in so many parts of the world; and if in any place they are not
2232,DEDIT,"actually dismantled, it is because that there the intellect of the"
2233,DEDIT,inhabitants is dismantled. The commanding officer of an old fort near
2234,DEDIT,"Valdivia in South America, when a traveler remarked to him that, with"
2235,DEDIT,"one discharge, his gun-carriages would certainly fall to pieces,"
2236,DEDIT,"gravely replied, ""No, I am sure, sir, they would stand two."" Perhaps"
2237,DEDIT,the guns of Quebec would stand three. Such structures carry us back to
2238,DEDIT,"the Middle Ages, the siege of Jerusalem, and St. Jean d'Acre, and the"
2239,DEDIT,days of the Bucaniers. In the armory of the citadel they showed me a
2240,DEDIT,"clumsy implement, long since useless, which they called a Lombard gun."
2241,DEDIT,"I thought that their whole citadel was such a Lombard gun, fit object"
2242,DEDIT,for the museums of the curious. Such works do not consist with the
2243,DEDIT,"development of the intellect. Huge stone structures of all kinds, both"
2244,DEDIT,"in their erection and by their influence when erected, rather oppress"
2245,DEDIT,"than liberate the mind. They are tombs for the souls of men, as"
2246,DEDIT,frequently for their bodies also. The sentinel with his musket beside
2247,DEDIT,a man with his umbrella is spectral. There is not sufficient reason
2248,DEDIT,"for his existence. Does my friend there, with a bullet resting on half"
2249,DEDIT,"an ounce of powder, think that he needs that argument in conversing"
2250,DEDIT,"with me? The fort was the first institution that was founded here, and"
2251,DEDIT,it is amusing to read in Champlain how assiduously they worked at it
2252,DEDIT,almost from the first day of the settlement. The founders of the
2253,DEDIT,"colony thought this an excellent site for a wall,--and no doubt it was"
2254,DEDIT,"a better site, in some respects, for a wall than for a city,--but it"
2255,DEDIT,"chanced that a city got behind it. It chanced, too, that a Lower Town"
2256,DEDIT,"got before it, and clung like an oyster to the outside of the crags,"
2257,DEDIT,as you may see at low tide. It is as if you were to come to a country
2258,DEDIT,"village surrounded by palisades in the old Indian fashion,--interesting"
2259,DEDIT,only as a relic of antiquity and barbarism. A fortified town is like a
2260,DEDIT,"man cased in the heavy armor of antiquity, with a horse-load of"
2261,DEDIT,"broadswords and small arms slung to him, endeavoring to go about his"
2262,DEDIT,business. Or is this an indispensable machinery for the good
2263,DEDIT,government of the country? The inhabitants of California succeed
2264,DEDIT,"pretty well, and are doing better and better every day, without any"
2265,DEDIT,"such institution. What use has this fortress served, to look at it"
2266,DEDIT,even from the soldiers' point of view? At first the French took care
2267,DEDIT,"of it; yet Wolfe sailed by it with impunity, and took the town of"
2268,DEDIT,Quebec without experiencing any hindrance at last from its
2269,DEDIT,fortifications. They were only the bone for which the parties fought.
2270,DEDIT,Then the English began to take care of it. So of any fort in the
2271,DEDIT,"world,--that in Boston Harbor, for instance. We shall at length hear"
2272,DEDIT,"that an enemy sailed by it in the night, for it cannot sail itself,"
2273,DEDIT,and both it and its inhabitants are always benighted. How often we
2274,DEDIT,"read that the enemy occupied a position which commanded the old, and"
2275,DEDIT,so the fort was evacuated! Have not the schoolhouse and the
2276,DEDIT,printing-press occupied a position which commands such a fort as this?
2277,DEDIT,
2278,DEDIT,"However, this is a ruin kept in remarkably good repair. There are some"
2279,DEDIT,eight hundred or thousand men there to exhibit it. One regiment goes
2280,DEDIT,bare-legged to increase the attraction. If you wish to study the
2281,DEDIT,"muscles of the leg about the knee, repair to Quebec. This universal"
2282,DEDIT,exhibition in Canada of the tools and sinews of war reminded me of the
2283,DEDIT,keeper of a menagerie showing his animals' claws. It was the English
2284,DEDIT,leopard showing his claws. Always the royal something or other; as at
2285,DEDIT,"the menagerie, the Royal Bengal Tiger. Silliman states that ""the cold"
2286,DEDIT,"is so intense in the winter nights, particularly on Cape Diamond, that"
2287,DEDIT,"the sentinels cannot stand it more than one hour, and are relieved at"
2288,DEDIT,"the expiration of that time;"" ""and even, as it is said, at much"
2289,DEDIT,"shorter intervals, in case of the most extreme cold."" What a natural"
2290,DEDIT,or unnatural fool must that soldier be--to say nothing of his
2291,DEDIT,"government--who, when quicksilver is freezing and blood is ceasing to"
2292,DEDIT,"be quick, will stand to have his face frozen, watching the walls of"
2293,DEDIT,"Quebec, though, so far as they are concerned, both honest and"
2294,DEDIT,dishonest men all the world over have been in their beds nearly half a
2295,DEDIT,"century,--or at least for that space travelers have visited Quebec"
2296,DEDIT,only as they would read history! I shall never again wake up in a
2297,DEDIT,"colder night than usual, but I shall think how rapidly the sentinels"
2298,DEDIT,"are relieving one another on the walls of Quebec, their quicksilver"
2299,DEDIT,"being all frozen, as if apprehensive that some hostile Wolfe may even"
2300,DEDIT,"then be scaling the Heights of Abraham, or some persevering Arnold"
2301,DEDIT,"about to issue from the wilderness; some Malay or Japanese, perchance,"
2302,DEDIT,"coming round by the northwest coast, have chosen that moment to"
2303,DEDIT,"assault the citadel! Why, I should as soon expect to find the"
2304,DEDIT,"sentinels still relieving one another on the walls of Nineveh, which"
2305,DEDIT,have so long been buried to the world. What a troublesome thing a wall
2306,DEDIT,"is! I thought it was to defend me, and not I it! Of course, if they"
2307,DEDIT,"had no wall, they would not need to have any sentinels."
2308,DEDIT,
2309,DEDIT,You might venture to advertise this farm as well fenced with
2310,DEDIT,substantial stone walls (saying nothing about the eight hundred
2311,DEDIT,Highlanders and Royal Irish who are required to keep them from
2312,DEDIT,toppling down); stock and tools to go with the land if desired. But it
2313,DEDIT,would not be wise for the seller to exhibit his farm-book.
2314,DEDIT,
2315,DEDIT,"Why should Canada, wild and unsettled as it is, impress us as an older"
2316,DEDIT,"country than the States, unless because her institutions are old? All"
2317,DEDIT,"things appeared to contend there, as I have implied, with a certain"
2318,DEDIT,"rust of antiquity, such as forms on old armor and iron guns,--the rust"
2319,DEDIT,of conventions and formalities. It is said that the metallic roofs of
2320,DEDIT,Montreal and Quebec keep sound and bright for forty years in some
2321,DEDIT,"cases. But if the rust was not on the tinned roofs and spires, it was"
2322,DEDIT,on the inhabitants and their institutions. Yet the work of burnishing
2323,DEDIT,goes briskly forward. I imagined that the government vessels at the
2324,DEDIT,"wharves were laden with rottenstone and oxalic acid,--that is what the"
2325,DEDIT,"first ship from England in the spring comes freighted with,--and the"
2326,DEDIT,hands of the Colonial legislature are cased in wash-leather. The
2327,DEDIT,"principal exports must be _gun_ny bags, verdigris, and iron rust."
2328,DEDIT,"Those who first built this fort, coming from Old France with the"
2329,DEDIT,"memory and tradition of feudal days and customs weighing on them, were"
2330,DEDIT,unquestionably behind their age; and those who now inhabit and repair
2331,DEDIT,it are behind their ancestors or predecessors. Those old chevaliers
2332,DEDIT,thought that they could transplant the feudal system to America. It
2333,DEDIT,"has been set out, but it has not thriven. Notwithstanding that Canada"
2334,DEDIT,"was settled first, and, unlike New England, for a long series of years"
2335,DEDIT,enjoyed the fostering care of the mother country; notwithstanding
2336,DEDIT,"that, as Charlevoix tells us, it had more of the ancient _noblesse_"
2337,DEDIT,"among its early settlers than any other of the French colonies, and"
2338,DEDIT,"perhaps than all the others together, there are in both the Canadas"
2339,DEDIT,"but 600,000 of French descent to-day,--about half so many as the"
2340,DEDIT,population of Massachusetts. The whole population of both Canadas is
2341,DEDIT,"but about 1,700,000 Canadians, English, Irish, Scotch, Indians, and"
2342,DEDIT,"all, put together! Samuel Laing, in his essay on the Northmen, to"
2343,DEDIT,"whom especially, rather than the Saxons, he refers the energy and"
2344,DEDIT,"indeed the excellence of the English character, observes that, when"
2345,DEDIT,"they occupied Scandinavia, ""each man possessed his lot of land without"
2346,DEDIT,"reference to, or acknowledgment of, any other man, without any local"
2347,DEDIT,chief to whom his military service or other quit-rent for his land was
2348,DEDIT,"due,--without tenure from, or duty or obligation to, any superior,"
2349,DEDIT,"real or fictitious, except the general sovereign. The individual"
2350,DEDIT,"settler held his land, as his descendants in Norway still express it,"
2351,DEDIT,"by the same right as the King held his crown, by udal right, or"
2352,DEDIT,"adel,--that is, noble right."" The French have occupied Canada, not"
2353,DEDIT,"_udally_, or by noble right, but _feudally_, or by ignoble right. They"
2354,DEDIT,are a nation of peasants.
2355,DEDIT,
2356,DEDIT,"It was evident that, both on account of the feudal system and the"
2357,DEDIT,"aristocratic government, a private man was not worth so much in Canada"
2358,DEDIT,"as in the United States; and, if your wealth in any measure consists"
2359,DEDIT,"in manliness, in originality and independence, you had better stay"
2360,DEDIT,"here. How could a peaceable, freethinking man live neighbor to the"
2361,DEDIT,Forty-ninth Regiment? A New-Englander would naturally be a bad
2362,DEDIT,"citizen, probably a rebel, there,--certainly if he were already a"
2363,DEDIT,rebel at home. I suspect that a poor man who is not servile is a much
2364,DEDIT,rarer phenomenon there and in England than in the Northern United
2365,DEDIT,"States. An Englishman, methinks,--not to speak of other European"
2366,DEDIT,"nations,--habitually regards himself merely as a constituent part of"
2367,DEDIT,the English nation; he is a member of the royal regiment of
2368,DEDIT,"Englishmen, and is proud of his company, as he has reason to be proud"
2369,DEDIT,of it. But an American--one who has made a tolerable use of his
2370,DEDIT,"opportunities--cares, comparatively, little about such things, and is"
2371,DEDIT,advantageously nearer to the primitive and the ultimate condition of
2372,DEDIT,"man in these respects. It is a government, that English one,--like"
2373,DEDIT,"most other European ones,--that cannot afford to be forgotten, as you"
2374,DEDIT,would naturally forget it; under which one cannot be wholesomely
2375,DEDIT,"neglected, and grow up a man and not an Englishman merely,--cannot be"
2376,DEDIT,a poet even without danger of being made poet-laureate! Give me a
2377,DEDIT,country where it is the most natural thing in the world for a
2378,DEDIT,government that does not understand you to let you alone. One would
2379,DEDIT,say that a true Englishman could speculate only within bounds. (It is
2380,DEDIT,"true the Americans have proved that they, in more than one sense, can"
2381,DEDIT,_speculate_ without bounds.) He has to pay his respects to so many
2382,DEDIT,"things, that, before he knows it, he _may_ have paid away all he is"
2383,DEDIT,"worth. What makes the United States government, on the whole, more"
2384,DEDIT,tolerable--I mean for us lucky white men--is the fact that there is so
2385,DEDIT,much less of government with us. Here it is only once in a month or a
2386,DEDIT,year that a man _needs_ remember that institution; and those who go to
2387,DEDIT,Congress can play the game of the Kilkenny cats there without fatal
2388,DEDIT,"consequences to those who stay at home, their term is so short; but in"
2389,DEDIT,Canada you are reminded of the government every day. It parades itself
2390,DEDIT,"before you. It is not content to be the servant, but will be the"
2391,DEDIT,master; and every day it goes out to the Plains of Abraham or to the
2392,DEDIT,Champ de Mars and exhibits itself and toots. Everywhere there appeared
2393,DEDIT,an attempt to make and to preserve trivial and otherwise transient
2394,DEDIT,distinctions. In the streets of Montreal and Quebec you met not only
2395,DEDIT,"with soldiers in red, and shuffling priests in unmistakable black and"
2396,DEDIT,"white, with Sisters of Charity gone into mourning for their deceased"
2397,DEDIT,"relative,--not to mention the nuns of various orders depending on the"
2398,DEDIT,"fashion of a tear, of whom you heard,--but youths belonging to some"
2399,DEDIT,"seminary or other, wearing coats edged with white, who looked as if"
2400,DEDIT,their expanding hearts were already repressed with a piece of tape. In
2401,DEDIT,"short, the inhabitants of Canada appeared to be suffering between two"
2402,DEDIT,"fires,--the soldiery and the priesthood."

2410,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2411,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2412,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"About twelve o'clock this day, being in the Lower Town, I looked up at"
2413,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the signal-gun by the flagstaff on Cape Diamond, and saw a soldier up"
2414,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"in the heavens there making preparations to fire it,--both he and the"
2415,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"gun in bold relief against the sky. Soon after, being warned by the"
2416,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"boom of the gun to look up again, there was only the cannon in the"
2417,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"sky, the smoke just blowing away from it, as if the soldier, having"
2418,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"touched it off, had concealed himself for effect, leaving the sound to"
2419,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"echo grandly from shore to shore, and far up and down the river. This"
2420,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,answered the purpose of a dinner-horn.
2421,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2422,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,There are no such restaurants in Quebec or Montreal as there are in
2423,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Boston. I hunted an hour or two in vain in this town to find one, till"
2424,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"I lost my appetite. In one house, called a restaurant, where lunches"
2425,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"were advertised, I found only tables covered with bottles and glasses"
2426,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"innumerable, containing apparently a sample of every liquid that has"
2427,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"been known since the earth dried up after the flood, but no scent of"
2428,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,solid food did I perceive gross enough to excite a hungry mouse. In
2429,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"short, I saw nothing to tempt me there, but a large map of Canada"
2430,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,against the wall. In another place I once more got as far as the
2431,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"bottles, and then asked for a bill of fare; was told to walk up"
2432,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"stairs; had no bill of fare, nothing but fare. ""Have you any pies or"
2433,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"puddings?"" I inquired, for I am obliged to keep my savageness in check"
2434,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"by a low diet. ""No, sir; we've nice mutton-chop, roast beef,"
2435,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"beefsteak, cutlets,"" and so on. A burly Englishman, who was in the"
2436,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"midst of the siege of a piece of roast beef, and of whom I have never"
2437,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"had a front view to this day, turned half round, with his mouth half"
2438,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"full, and remarked, ""You'll find no pies nor puddings in Quebec, sir;"
2439,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"they don't make any here."" I found that it was even so, and therefore"
2440,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,bought some musty cake and some fruit in the open market-place. This
2441,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"market-place by the waterside, where the old women sat by their tables"
2442,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"in the open air, amid a dense crowd jabbering all languages, was the"
2443,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"best place in Quebec to observe the people; and the ferry-boats,"
2444,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"continually coming and going with their motley crews and cargoes,"
2445,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,added much to the entertainment. I also saw them getting water from
2446,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the river, for Quebec is supplied with water by cart and barrel. This"
2447,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"city impressed me as wholly foreign and French, for I scarcely heard"
2448,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,the sound of the English language in the streets. More than three
2449,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,fifths of the inhabitants are of French origin; and if the traveler
2450,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"did not visit the fortifications particularly, he might not be"
2451,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"reminded that the English have any foothold here; and, in any case, if"
2452,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"he looked no farther than Quebec, they would appear to have planted"
2453,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,themselves in Canada only as they have in Spain at Gibraltar; and he
2454,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,who plants upon a rock cannot expect much increase. The novel sights
2455,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"and sounds by the waterside made me think of such ports as Boulogne,"
2456,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Dieppe, Rouen, and Havre-de-Grâce, which I have never seen; but I"
2457,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,have no doubt that they present similar scenes. I was much amused from
2458,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,first to last with the sounds made by the charette and caleche
2459,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,drivers. It was that part of their foreign language that you heard the
2460,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"most of,--the French they talked to their horses,--and which they"
2461,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,talked the loudest. It was a more novel sound to me than the French of
2462,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"conversation. The streets resounded with the cries, ""_Qui donc!_"""
2463,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"""_Marche tôt!_"" I suspect that many of our horses which came from"
2464,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Canada would prick up their ears at these sounds. Of the shops, I was"
2465,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"most attracted by those where furs and Indian works were sold, as"
2466,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,containing articles of genuine Canadian manufacture. I have been told
2467,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"that two townsmen of mine, who were interested in horticulture,"
2468,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"traveling once in Canada, and being in Quebec, thought it would be a"
2469,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,good opportunity to obtain seeds of the real Canada crookneck squash.
2470,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"So they went into a shop where such things were advertised, and"
2471,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,inquired for the same. The shopkeeper had the very thing they wanted.
2472,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"""But are you sure,"" they asked, ""that these are the genuine Canada"
2473,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"crookneck?"" ""Oh, yes, gentlemen,"" answered he, ""they are a lot which I"
2474,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"have received directly from Boston."" I resolved that my Canada"
2475,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,crookneck seeds should be such as had grown in Canada.
2476,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2477,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,Too much has not been said about the scenery of Quebec. The
2478,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"fortifications of Cape Diamond are omnipresent. They preside, they"
2479,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"frown over the river and surrounding country. You travel ten, twenty,"
2480,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"thirty miles up or down the river's banks, you ramble fifteen miles"
2481,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"amid the hills on either side, and then, when you have long since"
2482,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"forgotten them, perchance slept on them by the way, at a turn of the"
2483,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"road or of your body, there they are still, with their geometry"
2484,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,against the sky. The child that is born and brought up thirty miles
2485,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"distant, and has never traveled to the city, reads his country's"
2486,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"history, sees the level lines of the citadel amid the cloud-built"
2487,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"citadels in the western horizon, and is told that that is Quebec. No"
2488,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"wonder if Jacques Cartier's pilot exclaimed in Norman French, ""Que"
2489,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"bec!"" (What a beak!) when he saw this cape, as some suppose. Every"
2490,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,modern traveler involuntarily uses a similar expression. Particularly
2491,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,it is said that its sudden apparition on turning Point Levi makes a
2492,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,memorable impression on him who arrives by water. The view from Cape
2493,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,Diamond has been compared by European travelers with the most
2494,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"remarkable views of a similar kind in Europe, such as from Edinburgh"
2495,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Castle, Gibraltar, Cintra, and others, and preferred by many. A main"
2496,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"peculiarity in this, compared with other views which I have beheld, is"
2497,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"that it is from the ramparts of a fortified city, and not from a"
2498,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"solitary and majestic river cape alone, that this view is obtained. I"
2499,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"associate the beauty of Quebec with the steel-like and flashing air,"
2500,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"which may be peculiar to that season of the year, in which the blue"
2501,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,flowers of the succory and some late goldenrods and buttercups on the
2502,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"summit of Cape Diamond were almost my only companions,--the former"
2503,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,bluer than the heavens they faced. Yet even I yielded in some degree
2504,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"to the influence of historical associations, and found it hard to"
2505,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,attend to the geology of Cape Diamond or the botany of the Plains of
2506,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Abraham. I still remember the harbor far beneath me, sparkling like"
2507,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"silver in the sun, the answering highlands of Point Levi on the"
2508,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"southeast, the frowning Cap Tourmente abruptly bounding the seaward"
2509,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"view far in the northeast, the villages of Lorette and Charlesbourg on"
2510,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the north, and, further west, the distant Val Cartier, sparkling with"
2511,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"white cottages, hardly removed by distance through the clear air,--not"
2512,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,to mention a few blue mountains along the horizon in that direction.
2513,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,You look out from the ramparts of the citadel beyond the frontiers of
2514,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"civilization. Yonder small group of hills, according to the"
2515,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"guide-book, forms ""the portal of the wilds which are trodden only by"
2516,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the feet of the Indian hunters as far as Hudson's Bay."" It is but a"
2517,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,few years since Bouchette declared that the country ten leagues north
2518,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,of the British capital of North America was as little known as the
2519,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"middle of Africa. Thus the citadel under my feet, and all historical"
2520,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"associations, were swept away again by an influence from the wilds and"
2521,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"from Nature, as if the beholder had read her history,--an influence"
2522,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"which, like the Great River itself, flowed from the Arctic fastnesses"
2523,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,and Western forests with irresistible tide over all.

2546,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"long before the Mississippi, or even the Hudson, was known to the"
2547,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,world. Schoolcraft was misled by Gallatin into saying that Narvaez
2548,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,discovered the Mississippi. De Vega does _not_ say so. The first
2549,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,explorers declared that the summer in that country was as warm as
2550,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"France, and they named one of the bays in the Gulf of St. Lawrence the"

2580,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"different parts of its course, as it flows through what were formerly"
2581,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,the territories of different nations. From the Gulf to Lake Ontario
2582,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,it is called at present the St. Lawrence; from Montreal to the same
2583,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,place it is frequently called the Cateraqui; and higher up it is known
2584,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"successively as the Niagara, Detroit, St. Clair, St. Mary's, and St."
2585,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Louis rivers. Humboldt, speaking of the Orinoco, says that this name"
2586,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,is unknown in the interior of the country; so likewise the tribes that
2587,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,dwell about the sources of the St. Lawrence have never heard the name
2588,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,which it bears in the lower part of its course. It rises near another
2589,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"father of waters,--the Mississippi,--issuing from a remarkable spring"
2590,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"far up in the woods, called Lake Superior, fifteen hundred miles in"
2591,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,circumference; and several other springs there are thereabouts which
2592,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,feed it. It makes such a noise in its tumbling down at one place as is
2593,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"heard all round the world. Bouchette, the Surveyor-General of the"
2594,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Canadas, calls it ""the most splendid river on the globe;"" says that it"
2595,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,is two thousand statute miles long (more recent geographers make it
2596,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,four or five hundred miles longer); that at the Rivière du Sud it is
2597,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"eleven miles wide; at the Traverse, thirteen; at the Paps of Matane,"
2598,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"twenty-five; at the Seven Islands, seventy-three; and at its mouth,"
2599,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"from Cape Rosier to the Mingan Settlements in Labrador, near one"
2600,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,hundred and five (?) miles wide. According to Captain Bayfield's
2601,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,recent chart it is about _ninety-six_ geographical miles wide at the
2602,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"latter place, measuring at right angles with the stream. It has much"
2603,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the largest estuary, regarding both length and breadth, of any river"
2604,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"on the globe. Humboldt says that the River Plate, which has the"
2605,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"broadest estuary of the South American rivers, is ninety-two"
2606,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,geographical miles wide at its mouth; also he found the Orinoco to be
2607,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,more than three miles wide at five hundred and sixty miles from its
2608,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,mouth; but he does not tell us that ships of six hundred tons can sail
2609,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"up it so far, as they can up the St. Lawrence to Montreal,--an equal"
2610,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,distance. If he had described a fleet of such ships at anchor in a
2611,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"city's port so far inland, we should have got a very different idea of"
2612,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,the Orinoco. Perhaps Charlevoix describes the St. Lawrence truly as
2613,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,the most _navigable_ river in the world. Between Montreal and Quebec
2614,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,it averages about two miles wide. The tide is felt as far up as Three
2615,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Rivers, four hundred and thirty-two miles, which is as far as from"
2616,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Boston to Washington. As far up as Cap aux Oyes, sixty or seventy"
2617,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"miles below Quebec, Kalm found a great part of the plants near the"
2618,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"shore to be marine, as glasswort (_Salicornia_), seaside pease (_Pisum"
2619,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"maritimum_), sea-milkwort (_Glaux_), beach-grass (_Psamma arenaria_),"

2622,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2623,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,The geographer Guyot observes that the Marañon is three thousand miles
2624,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"long, and gathers its waters from a surface of a million and a half"
2625,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"square miles; that the Mississippi is also three thousand miles long,"
2626,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,but its basin covers only from eight to nine hundred thousand square
2627,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"miles; that the St. Lawrence is eighteen hundred miles long, and its"
2628,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,basin covers more than a million square miles (Darby says five hundred
2629,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"thousand); and speaking of the lakes, he adds, ""These vast fresh-water"
2630,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"seas, together with the St. Lawrence, cover a surface of nearly one"
2631,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"hundred thousand square miles, and it has been calculated that they"
2632,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,contain about one half of all the fresh water on the surface of our
2633,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"planet."" But all these calculations are necessarily very rude and"
2634,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"inaccurate. Its tributaries, the Ottawa, St. Maurice, and Saguenay,"
2635,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,are great rivers themselves. The latter is said to be more than one
2636,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"thousand (?) feet deep at its mouth, while its cliffs rise"
2637,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,perpendicularly an equal distance above its surface. Pilots say there
2638,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,are no soundings till one hundred and fifty miles up the St. Lawrence.
2639,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"The greatest sounding in the river, given on Bayfield's chart of the"
2640,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"gulf and river, is two hundred and twenty-eight fathoms. McTaggart, an"

2649,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"introduced at once into a majestic scenery, where everything is on a"

2652,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2653,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,We have not yet the data for a minute comparison of the St. Lawrence
2654,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"with the South American rivers; but it is obvious that, taking it in"
2655,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"connection with its lakes, its estuary, and its falls, it easily bears"
2656,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"off the palm from all the rivers on the globe; for though, as"
2657,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Bouchette observes, it may not carry to the ocean a greater volume of"
2658,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"water than the Amazon and Mississippi, its surface and cubic mass are"
2659,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"far greater than theirs. But, unfortunately, this noble river is"
2660,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,closed by ice from the beginning of December to the middle of April.
2661,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,The arrival of the first vessel from England when the ice breaks up

2684,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,that they fared in the following manner (I translate from the

2686,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"half a pound of beef. They ate pork for dinner, with half a pound of"

2690,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"supper. Monsieur Roberval administered good justice, and punished each"

2718,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,through. He must have had a troubled sleep. We were not long enough on
2719,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,the river to realize that it had length; we got only the impression of
2720,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"its breadth, as if we had passed over a lake a mile or two in breadth"
2721,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"and several miles long, though we might thus have slept through a"

2745,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,remarkably high wall and higher monument. The family returned to
2746,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,Europe. He could not have imagined how dead he would be in a few
2747,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"years, and all the more dead and forgotten for being buried under such"
2748,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"a mass of gloomy stone, where not even memory could get at him without"
2749,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"a crowbar. Ah! poor man, with that last end of his! However, he may"
2750,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,have been the worthiest of mortals for aught that I know. From the

2752,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,extensive island; the noble sea of the St. Lawrence swelling into

2780,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"and one or two more elsewhere in Canada, wearing homespun gray"
2781,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"greatcoats, or capotes, with conical and comical hoods, which fell"

2783,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"over the head when occasion required, though a hat usurped that place"
2784,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,now. They looked as if they would be convenient and proper enough as
2785,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"long as the coats were new and tidy, but would soon come to have a"
2786,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"beggarly and unsightly look, akin to rags and dust-holes. We reached"
2787,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Burlington early in the morning, where the Yankees tried to pass off"
2788,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"their Canada coppers, but the newsboys knew better. Returning through"
2789,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the Green Mountains, I was reminded that I had not seen in Canada such"
2790,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,brilliant autumnal tints as I had previously seen in Vermont. Perhaps
2791,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,there was not yet so great and sudden a contrast with the summer heats
2792,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,in the former country as in these mountain valleys. As we were passing
2793,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"through Ashburnham, by a new white house which stood at some distance"
2794,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"in a field, one passenger exclaimed, so that all in the car could hear"
2795,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"him, ""There, there's not so good a house as that in all Canada!"" I did"
2796,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"not much wonder at his remark, for there is a neatness, as well as"
2797,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"evident prosperity, a certain elastic easiness of circumstances, so to"
2798,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"speak, when not rich, about a New England house, as if the proprietor"
2799,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"could at least afford to make repairs in the spring, which the"
2800,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"Canadian houses do not suggest. Though of stone, they are no better"
2801,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"constructed than a stone barn would be with us; the only building,"
2802,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"except the château, on which money and taste are expended, being the"
2803,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,church. In Canada an ordinary New England house would be mistaken for
2804,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"the château, and while every village here contains at least several"
2805,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"gentlemen or ""squires,"" _there_ there is but one to a seigniory."
2806,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,
2807,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"I got home this Thursday evening, having spent just one week in Canada"
2808,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"and traveled eleven hundred miles. The whole expense of this journey,"
2809,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"including two guide-books and a map, which cost one dollar twelve and"
2810,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,"a half cents, was twelve dollars seventy-five cents. I do not suppose"
2811,THE SCENERY OF QUEBEC; AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE,that I have seen all British America; that could not be done by a

2824,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2825,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2826,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Books of natural history make the most cheerful winter reading. I read
2827,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"in Audubon with a thrill of delight, when the snow covers the ground,"
2828,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"of the magnolia, and the Florida keys, and their warm sea-breezes; of"
2829,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"the fence-rail, and the cotton-tree, and the migrations of the"
2830,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"rice-bird; of the breaking up of winter in Labrador, and the melting"
2831,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],of the snow on the forks of the Missouri; and owe an accession of
2832,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],health to these reminiscences of luxuriant nature.
2833,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2834,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Within the circuit of this plodding life,"
2835,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"There enter moments of an azure hue,"
2836,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Untarnished fair as is the violet
2837,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Or anemone, when the spring strews them"
2838,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"By some meandering rivulet, which make"
2839,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],The best philosophy untrue that aims
2840,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],But to console man for his grievances.
2841,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"I have remembered, when the winter came,"
2842,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"High in my chamber in the frosty nights,"
2843,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"When in the still light of the cheerful moon,"
2844,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"On every twig and rail and jutting spout,"
2845,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],The icy spears were adding to their length
2846,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Against the arrows of the coming sun,"
2847,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],How in the shimmering noon of summer past
2848,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Some unrecorded beam slanted across
2849,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew;
2850,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,"
2851,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag"
2852,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,"
2853,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Which now through all its course stands still and dumb,"
2854,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Its own memorial,--purling at its play"
2855,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Along the slopes, and through the meadows next,"
2856,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Until its youthful sound was hushed at last
2857,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],In the staid current of the lowland stream;
2858,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,"
2859,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,"
2860,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],When all the fields around lay bound and hoar
2861,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Beneath a thick integument of snow.
2862,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],So by God's cheap economy made rich
2863,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],To go upon my winter's task again.
2864,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2865,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"I am singularly refreshed in winter when I hear of service-berries,"
2866,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"poke-weed, juniper. Is not heaven made up of these cheap summer"
2867,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"glories? There is a singular health in those words, Labrador and East"
2868,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Main, which no desponding creed recognizes. How much more than Federal"
2869,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],are these States! If there were no other vicissitudes than the
2870,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"seasons, our interest would never tire. Much more is adoing than"
2871,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Congress wots of. What journal do the persimmon and the buckeye keep,"
2872,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],and the sharp-shinned hawk? What is transpiring from summer to winter
2873,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"in the Carolinas, and the Great Pine Forest, and the Valley of the"
2874,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Mohawk? The merely political aspect of the land is never very
2875,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],cheering; men are degraded when considered as the members of a
2876,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],political organization. On this side all lands present only the
2877,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"symptoms of decay. I see but Bunker Hill and Sing-Sing, the District"
2878,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"of Columbia and Sullivan's Island, with a few avenues connecting them."
2879,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],But paltry are they all beside one blast of the east or the south wind
2880,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],which blows over them.
2881,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2882,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"In society you will not find health, but in nature. Unless our feet at"
2883,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"least stood in the midst of nature, all our faces would be pale and"
2884,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"livid. Society is always diseased, and the best is the most so. There"
2885,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"is no scent in it so wholesome as that of the pines, nor any fragrance"
2886,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],so penetrating and restorative as the life-everlasting in high
2887,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],pastures. I would keep some book of natural history always by me as a
2888,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"sort of elixir, the reading of which should restore the tone of the"
2889,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"system. To the sick, indeed, nature is sick, but to the well, a"
2890,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],fountain of health. To him who contemplates a trait of natural beauty
2891,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"no harm nor disappointment can come. The doctrines of despair, of"
2892,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"spiritual or political tyranny or servitude, were never taught by such"
2893,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],as shared the serenity of nature. Surely good courage will not flag
2894,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"here on the Atlantic border, as long as we are flanked by the Fur"
2895,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Countries. There is enough in that sound to cheer one under any
2896,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"circumstances. The spruce, the hemlock, and the pine will not"
2897,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],countenance despair. Methinks some creeds in vestries and churches do
2898,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"forget the hunter wrapped in furs by the Great Slave Lake, and that"
2899,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"the Esquimaux sledges are drawn by dogs, and in the twilight of the"
2900,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],northern night the hunter does not give over to follow the seal and
2901,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],walrus on the ice. They are of sick and diseased imaginations who
2902,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],would toll the world's knell so soon. Cannot these sedentary sects do
2903,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],better than prepare the shrouds and write the epitaphs of those other
2904,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],busy living men? The practical faith of all men belies the preacher's
2905,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"consolation. What is any man's discourse to me, if I am not sensible"
2906,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],of something in it as steady and cheery as the creak of crickets? In
2907,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],it the woods must be relieved against the sky. Men tire me when I am
2908,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],not constantly greeted and refreshed as by the flux of sparkling
2909,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],streams. Surely joy is the condition of life. Think of the young fry
2910,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"that leap in ponds, the myriads of insects ushered into being on a"
2911,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"summer evening, the incessant note of the hyla with which the woods"
2912,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"ring in the spring, the nonchalance of the butterfly carrying accident"
2913,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"and change painted in a thousand hues upon its wings, or the brook"
2914,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"minnow stoutly stemming the current, the lustre of whose scales, worn"
2915,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"bright by the attrition, is reflected upon the bank!"
2916,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2917,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"We fancy that this din of religion, literature, and philosophy, which"
2918,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"is heard in pulpits, lyceums, and parlors, vibrates through the"
2919,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"universe, and is as catholic a sound as the creaking of the earth's"
2920,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"axle; but if a man sleep soundly, he will forget it all between sunset"
2921,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"and dawn. It is the three-inch swing of a pendulum in a cupboard,"
2922,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],which the great pulse of nature vibrates by and through each instant.
2923,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"When we lift our eyelids and open our ears, it disappears with smoke"
2924,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],and rattle like the cars on a railroad. When I detect a beauty in any
2925,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"of the recesses of nature, I am reminded, by the serene and retired"
2926,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"spirit in which it requires to be contemplated, of the inexpressible"
2927,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"privacy of a life,--how silent and unambitious it is. The beauty there"
2928,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"is in mosses must be considered from the holiest, quietest nook. What"
2929,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],an admirable training is science for the more active warfare of life!
2930,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Indeed, the unchallenged bravery which these studies imply, is far"
2931,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],more impressive than the trumpeted valor of the warrior. I am pleased
2932,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"to learn that Thales was up and stirring by night not unfrequently,"
2933,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"as his astronomical discoveries prove. Linnæus, setting out for"
2934,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Lapland, surveys his ""comb"" and ""spare shirt,"" ""leathern breeches"" and"
2935,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"""gauze cap to keep off gnats,"" with as much complacency as Bonaparte a"
2936,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],park of artillery for the Russian campaign. The quiet bravery of the
2937,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"man is admirable. His eye is to take in fish, flower, and bird,"
2938,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],quadruped and biped. Science is always brave; for to know is to know
2939,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],good; doubt and danger quail before her eye. What the coward overlooks
2940,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"in his hurry, she calmly scrutinizes, breaking ground like a pioneer"
2941,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],for the array of arts that follow in her train. But cowardice is
2942,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],unscientific; for there cannot be a science of ignorance. There may be
2943,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"a science of bravery, for that advances; but a retreat is rarely well"
2944,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"conducted; if it is, then is it an orderly advance in the face of"
2945,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],circumstances.
2946,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2947,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],But to draw a little nearer to our promised topics. Entomology extends
2948,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"the limits of being in a new direction, so that I walk in nature with"
2949,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"a sense of greater space and freedom. It suggests besides, that the"
2950,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"universe is not rough-hewn, but perfect in its details. Nature will"
2951,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],bear the closest inspection; she invites us to lay our eye level with
2952,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"the smallest leaf, and take an insect view of its plain. She has no"
2953,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"interstices; every part is full of life. I explore, too, with"
2954,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"pleasure, the sources of the myriad sounds which crowd the summer"
2955,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"noon, and which seem the very grain and stuff of which eternity is"
2956,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],made. Who does not remember the shrill roll-call of the harvest-fly?
2957,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"There were ears for these sounds in Greece long ago, as Anacreon's ode"
2958,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],will show.
2959,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2960,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"""We pronounce thee happy, Cicada,"
2961,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"For on the tops of the trees,"
2962,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Drinking a little dew,"
2963,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Like any king thou singest,"
2964,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"For thine are they all,"
2965,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Whatever thou seest in the fields,"
2966,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],And whatever the woods bear.
2967,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Thou art the friend of the husbandmen,"
2968,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],In no respect injuring any one;
2969,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"And thou art honored among men,"

2971,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"The Muses love thee,"
2972,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"And Phoebus himself loves thee,"
2973,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],And has given thee a shrill song;

2975,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Thou skillful, earthborn, song-loving,"
2976,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Unsuffering, bloodless one;"
2977,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"Almost thou art like the gods."""
2978,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2979,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"In the autumn days, the creaking of crickets is heard at noon over all"
2980,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"the land, and as in summer they are heard chiefly at nightfall, so"
2981,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],then by their incessant chirp they usher in the evening of the year.
2982,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Nor can all the vanities that vex the world alter one whit the measure
2983,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],that night has chosen. Every pulse-beat is in exact time with the
2984,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],cricket's chant and the tickings of the deathwatch in the wall.
2985,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],Alternate with these if you can.
2986,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],
2987,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],About two hundred and eighty birds either reside permanently in the
2988,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"State, or spend the summer only, or make us a passing visit. Those"
2989,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],which spend the winter with us have obtained our warmest sympathy. The

2994,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"link extended over from autumn to spring, preserving unbroken the"

2996,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],blasts of winter; the robin[4] and lark lurking by warm springs in the
2997,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],woods; the familiar snowbird culling a few seeds in the garden or a
2998,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"few crumbs in the yard; and occasionally the shrike, with heedless and"

3001,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],His steady sails he never furls
3002,NATURAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS[3],"At any time o' year,"

3023,RETURN OF SPRING,"The cup of Bacchus is crowned,"
3024,RETURN OF SPRING,"Along the leaves, along the branches,"
3025,RETURN OF SPRING,"The fruit, bending them down, flourishes."
3026,RETURN OF SPRING,
3027,RETURN OF SPRING,"The ducks alight at this season in the still water, in company with"
3028,RETURN OF SPRING,"the gulls, which do not fail to improve an east wind to visit our"
3029,RETURN OF SPRING,"meadows, and swim about by twos and threes, pluming themselves, and"
3030,RETURN OF SPRING,"diving to peck at the root of the lily, and the cranberries which the"
3031,RETURN OF SPRING,frost has not loosened. The first flock of geese is seen beating to
3032,RETURN OF SPRING,"north, in long harrows and waving lines; the jingle of the song"
3033,RETURN OF SPRING,sparrow salutes us from the shrubs and fences; the plaintive note of
3034,RETURN OF SPRING,"the lark comes clear and sweet from the meadow; and the bluebird, like"
3035,RETURN OF SPRING,"an azure ray, glances past us in our walk. The fish hawk, too, is"
3036,RETURN OF SPRING,"occasionally seen at this season sailing majestically over the water,"
3037,RETURN OF SPRING,and he who has once observed it will not soon forget the majesty of
3038,RETURN OF SPRING,"its flight. It sails the air like a ship of the line, worthy to"
3039,RETURN OF SPRING,"struggle with the elements, falling back from time to time like a ship"
3040,RETURN OF SPRING,"on its beam ends, and holding its talons up as if ready for the"
3041,RETURN OF SPRING,"arrows, in the attitude of the national bird. It is a great presence,"
3042,RETURN OF SPRING,as of the master of river and forest. Its eye would not quail before
3043,RETURN OF SPRING,"the owner of the soil, but make him feel like an intruder on its"
3044,RETURN OF SPRING,"domains. And then its retreat, sailing so steadily away, is a kind of"
3045,RETURN OF SPRING,"advance. I have by me one of a pair of ospreys, which have for some"
3046,RETURN OF SPRING,"years fished in this vicinity, shot by a neighboring pond, measuring"
3047,RETURN OF SPRING,"more than two feet in length, and six in the stretch of its wings."
3048,RETURN OF SPRING,"Nuttall mentions that ""the ancients, particularly Aristotle, pretended"
3049,RETURN OF SPRING,"that the ospreys taught their young to gaze at the sun, and those who"
3050,RETURN OF SPRING,"were unable to do so were destroyed. Linnæus even believed, on ancient"
3051,RETURN OF SPRING,"authority, that one of the feet of this bird had all the toes divided,"
3052,RETURN OF SPRING,"while the other was partly webbed, so that it could swim with one"
3053,RETURN OF SPRING,"foot, and grasp a fish with the other."" But that educated eye is now"
3054,RETURN OF SPRING,"dim, and those talons are nerveless. Its shrill scream seems yet to"
3055,RETURN OF SPRING,"linger in its throat, and the roar of the sea in its wings. There is"
3056,RETURN OF SPRING,"the tyranny of Jove in its claws, and his wrath in the erectile"
3057,RETURN OF SPRING,feathers of the head and neck. It reminds me of the Argonautic
3058,RETURN OF SPRING,"expedition, and would inspire the dullest to take flight over"
3059,RETURN OF SPRING,Parnassus.
3060,RETURN OF SPRING,
3061,RETURN OF SPRING,"The booming of the bittern, described by Goldsmith and Nuttall, is"
3062,RETURN OF SPRING,"frequently heard in our fens, in the morning and evening, sounding"
3063,RETURN OF SPRING,"like a pump, or the chopping of wood in a frosty morning in some"
3064,RETURN OF SPRING,distant farm-yard. The manner in which this sound is produced I have
3065,RETURN OF SPRING,"not seen anywhere described. On one occasion, the bird has been seen"
3066,RETURN OF SPRING,"by one of my neighbors to thrust its bill into the water, and suck up"
3067,RETURN OF SPRING,"as much as it could hold, then, raising its head, it pumped it out"
3068,RETURN OF SPRING,"again with four or five heaves of the neck, throwing it two or three"
3069,RETURN OF SPRING,"feet, and making the sound each time."
3070,RETURN OF SPRING,
3071,RETURN OF SPRING,At length the summer's eternity is ushered in by the cackle of the
3072,RETURN OF SPRING,"flicker among the oaks on the hillside, and a new dynasty begins with"
3073,RETURN OF SPRING,calm security.
3074,RETURN OF SPRING,
3075,RETURN OF SPRING,"In May and June the woodland quire is in full tune, and, given the"
3076,RETURN OF SPRING,"immense spaces of hollow air, and this curious human ear, one does"

3078,RETURN OF SPRING,
3079,RETURN OF SPRING,Each summer sound

3081,RETURN OF SPRING,
3082,RETURN OF SPRING,"As the season advances, and those birds which make us but a passing"

3084,RETURN OF SPRING,ruffle the drowsy air. But the solitary rambler may still find a
3085,RETURN OF SPRING,response and expression for every mood in the depths of the wood.
3086,RETURN OF SPRING,
3087,RETURN OF SPRING,"Sometimes I hear the veery's[5] clarion,"

3101,RETURN OF SPRING,Striving to lift our thoughts above the street.
3102,RETURN OF SPRING,
3103,RETURN OF SPRING,With the autumn begins in some measure a new spring. The plover is
3104,RETURN OF SPRING,"heard whistling high in the air over the dry pastures, the finches"
3105,RETURN OF SPRING,"flit from tree to tree, the bobolinks and flickers fly in flocks, and"
3106,RETURN OF SPRING,"the goldfinch rides on the earliest blast, like a winged hyla peeping"
3107,RETURN OF SPRING,"amid the rustle of the leaves. The crows, too, begin now to"
3108,RETURN OF SPRING,congregate; you may stand and count them as they fly low and
3109,RETURN OF SPRING,"straggling over the landscape, singly or by twos and threes, at"
3110,RETURN OF SPRING,"intervals of half a mile, until a hundred have passed."
3111,RETURN OF SPRING,
3112,RETURN OF SPRING,I have seen it suggested somewhere that the crow was brought to this
3113,RETURN OF SPRING,country by the white man; but I shall as soon believe that the white
3114,RETURN OF SPRING,man planted these pines and hemlocks. He is no spaniel to follow our
3115,RETURN OF SPRING,steps; but rather flits about the clearings like the dusky spirit of
3116,RETURN OF SPRING,"the Indian, reminding me oftener of Philip and Powhatan than of"
3117,RETURN OF SPRING,"Winthrop and Smith. He is a relic of the dark ages. By just so slight,"
3118,RETURN OF SPRING,by just so lasting a tenure does superstition hold the world ever;
3119,RETURN OF SPRING,"there is the rook in England, and the crow in New England."

3130,RETURN OF SPRING,"What bravery inspires thy throat,"
3131,RETURN OF SPRING,"And bears thee up above the clouds,"
3132,RETURN OF SPRING,"Over desponding human crowds,"
3133,RETURN OF SPRING,Which far below

3136,RETURN OF SPRING,"The late walker or sailor, in the October evenings, may hear the"
3137,RETURN OF SPRING,"murmurings of the snipe, circling over the meadows, the most"
3138,RETURN OF SPRING,"spirit-like sound in nature; and still later in the autumn, when the"
3139,RETURN OF SPRING,"frosts have tinged the leaves, a solitary loon pays a visit to our"
3140,RETURN OF SPRING,"retired ponds, where he may lurk undisturbed till the season of"
3141,RETURN OF SPRING,"moulting is passed, making the woods ring with his wild laughter. This"
3142,RETURN OF SPRING,"bird, the Great Northern Diver, well deserves its name; for when"
3143,RETURN OF SPRING,"pursued with a boat, it will dive, and swim like a fish under water,"
3144,RETURN OF SPRING,"for sixty rods or more, as fast as a boat can be paddled, and its"
3145,RETURN OF SPRING,"pursuer, if he would discover his game again, must put his ear to the"
3146,RETURN OF SPRING,"surface to hear where it comes up. When it comes to the surface, it"
3147,RETURN OF SPRING,"throws the water off with one shake of its wings, and calmly swims"
3148,RETURN OF SPRING,about until again disturbed.
3149,RETURN OF SPRING,
3150,RETURN OF SPRING,These are the sights and sounds which reach our senses oftenest during
3151,RETURN OF SPRING,"the year. But sometimes one hears a quite new note, which has for"
3152,RETURN OF SPRING,"background other Carolinas and Mexicos than the books describe, and"
3153,RETURN OF SPRING,learns that his ornithology has done him no service.
3154,RETURN OF SPRING,
3155,RETURN OF SPRING,It appears from the Report that there are about forty quadrupeds
3156,RETURN OF SPRING,"belonging to the State, and among these one is glad to hear of a few"
3157,RETURN OF SPRING,"bears, wolves, lynxes, and wildcats."
3158,RETURN OF SPRING,
3159,RETURN OF SPRING,"When our river overflows its banks in the spring, the wind from the"
3160,RETURN OF SPRING,"meadows is laden with a strong scent of musk, and by its freshness"
3161,RETURN OF SPRING,advertises me of an unexplored wildness. Those backwoods are not far
3162,RETURN OF SPRING,"off then. I am affected by the sight of the cabins of the muskrat,"
3163,RETURN OF SPRING,"made of mud and grass, and raised three or four feet along the river,"
3164,RETURN OF SPRING,as when I read of the barrows of Asia. The muskrat is the beaver of
3165,RETURN OF SPRING,the settled States. Their number has even increased within a few
3166,RETURN OF SPRING,years in this vicinity. Among the rivers which empty into the
3167,RETURN OF SPRING,"Merrimack, the Concord is known to the boatmen as a dead stream. The"
3168,RETURN OF SPRING,"Indians are said to have called it Musketaquid, or Prairie River. Its"
3169,RETURN OF SPRING,current being much more sluggish and its water more muddy than the
3170,RETURN OF SPRING,"rest, it abounds more in fish and game of every kind. According to the"
3171,RETURN OF SPRING,"History of the town, ""The fur-trade was here once very important. As"
3172,RETURN OF SPRING,"early as 1641, a company was formed in the colony, of which Major"
3173,RETURN OF SPRING,"Willard of Concord was superintendent, and had the exclusive right to"
3174,RETURN OF SPRING,trade with the Indians in furs and other articles; and for this right
3175,RETURN OF SPRING,they were obliged to pay into the public treasury one twentieth of all
3176,RETURN OF SPRING,"the furs they obtained."" There are trappers in our midst still, as"
3177,RETURN OF SPRING,"well as on the streams of the far West, who night and morning go the"
3178,RETURN OF SPRING,"round of their traps, without fear of the Indian. One of these takes"
3179,RETURN OF SPRING,"from one hundred and fifty to two hundred muskrats in a year, and even"
3180,RETURN OF SPRING,"thirty-six have been shot by one man in a day. Their fur, which is not"
3181,RETURN OF SPRING,"nearly as valuable as formerly, is in good condition in the winter and"
3182,RETURN OF SPRING,"spring only; and upon the breaking up of the ice, when they are driven"
3183,RETURN OF SPRING,"out of their holes by the water, the greatest number is shot from"
3184,RETURN OF SPRING,"boats, either swimming or resting on their stools, or slight supports"
3185,RETURN OF SPRING,"of grass and reeds, by the side of the stream. Though they exhibit"
3186,RETURN OF SPRING,"considerable cunning at other times, they are easily taken in a trap,"
3187,RETURN OF SPRING,"which has only to be placed in their holes, or wherever they frequent,"
3188,RETURN OF SPRING,"without any bait being used, though it is sometimes rubbed with their"
3189,RETURN OF SPRING,"musk. In the winter the hunter cuts holes in the ice, and shoots them"
3190,RETURN OF SPRING,when they come to the surface. Their burrows are usually in the high
3191,RETURN OF SPRING,"banks of the river, with the entrance under water, and rising within"
3192,RETURN OF SPRING,"to above the level of high water. Sometimes their nests, composed of"
3193,RETURN OF SPRING,"dried meadow-grass and flags, may be discovered where the bank is low"
3194,RETURN OF SPRING,"and spongy, by the yielding of the ground under the feet. They have"
3195,RETURN OF SPRING,from three to seven or eight young in the spring.
3196,RETURN OF SPRING,
3197,RETURN OF SPRING,"Frequently, in the morning or evening, a long ripple is seen in the"
3198,RETURN OF SPRING,"still water, where a muskrat is crossing the stream, with only its"
3199,RETURN OF SPRING,"nose above the surface, and sometimes a green bough in its mouth to"
3200,RETURN OF SPRING,"build its house with. When it finds itself observed, it will dive and"
3201,RETURN OF SPRING,"swim five or six rods under water, and at length conceal itself in its"
3202,RETURN OF SPRING,"hole, or the weeds. It will remain under water for ten minutes at a"
3203,RETURN OF SPRING,"time, and on one occasion has been seen, when undisturbed, to form an"
3204,RETURN OF SPRING,"air-bubble under the ice, which contracted and expanded as it breathed"
3205,RETURN OF SPRING,"at leisure. When it suspects danger on shore, it will stand erect like"
3206,RETURN OF SPRING,"a squirrel, and survey its neighborhood for several minutes, without"
3207,RETURN OF SPRING,moving.
3208,RETURN OF SPRING,
3209,RETURN OF SPRING,"In the fall, if a meadow intervene between their burrows and the"
3210,RETURN OF SPRING,"stream, they erect cabins of mud and grass, three or four feet high,"
3211,RETURN OF SPRING,"near its edge. These are not their breeding-places, though young are"
3212,RETURN OF SPRING,"sometimes found in them in late freshets, but rather their"
3213,RETURN OF SPRING,"hunting-lodges, to which they resort in the winter with their food,"
3214,RETURN OF SPRING,and for shelter. Their food consists chiefly of flags and fresh-water
3215,RETURN OF SPRING,"mussels, the shells of the latter being left in large quantities"
3216,RETURN OF SPRING,around their lodges in the spring.
3217,RETURN OF SPRING,
3218,RETURN OF SPRING,"The Penobscot Indian wears the entire skin of a muskrat, with the"
3219,RETURN OF SPRING,"legs and tail dangling, and the head caught under his girdle, for a"
3220,RETURN OF SPRING,"pouch, into which he puts his fishing-tackle, and essences to scent"
3221,RETURN OF SPRING,his traps with.
3222,RETURN OF SPRING,
3223,RETURN OF SPRING,"The bear, wolf, lynx, wildcat, deer, beaver, and marten have"
3224,RETURN OF SPRING,disappeared; the otter is rarely if ever seen here at present; and the
3225,RETURN OF SPRING,mink is less common than formerly.
3226,RETURN OF SPRING,
3227,RETURN OF SPRING,"Perhaps of all our untamed quadrupeds, the fox has obtained the widest"
3228,RETURN OF SPRING,"and most familiar reputation, from the time of Pilpay and Æsop to the"
3229,RETURN OF SPRING,present day. His recent tracks still give variety to a winter's walk.
3230,RETURN OF SPRING,"I tread in the steps of the fox that has gone before me by some hours,"
3231,RETURN OF SPRING,"or which perhaps I have started, with such a tiptoe of expectation as"
3232,RETURN OF SPRING,"if I were on the trail of the Spirit itself which resides in the wood,"
3233,RETURN OF SPRING,and expected soon to catch it in its lair. I am curious to know what
3234,RETURN OF SPRING,"has determined its graceful curvatures, and how surely they were"
3235,RETURN OF SPRING,coincident with the fluctuations of some mind. I know which way a mind
3236,RETURN OF SPRING,"wended, what horizon it faced, by the setting of these tracks, and"
3237,RETURN OF SPRING,"whether it moved slowly or rapidly, by their greater or less intervals"
3238,RETURN OF SPRING,and distinctness; for the swiftest step leaves yet a lasting trace.
3239,RETURN OF SPRING,"Sometimes you will see the trails of many together, and where they"
3240,RETURN OF SPRING,"have gamboled and gone through a hundred evolutions, which testify to"
3241,RETURN OF SPRING,a singular listlessness and leisure in nature.
3242,RETURN OF SPRING,
3243,RETURN OF SPRING,"When I see a fox run across the pond on the snow, with the"
3244,RETURN OF SPRING,"carelessness of freedom, or at intervals trace his course in the"
3245,RETURN OF SPRING,"sunshine along the ridge of a hill, I give up to him sun and earth as"
3246,RETURN OF SPRING,"to their true proprietor. He does not go in the sun, but it seems to"
3247,RETURN OF SPRING,"follow him, and there is a visible sympathy between him and it."
3248,RETURN OF SPRING,"Sometimes, when the snow lies light and but five or six inches deep,"
3249,RETURN OF SPRING,you may give chase and come up with one on foot. In such a case he
3250,RETURN OF SPRING,"will show a remarkable presence of mind, choosing only the safest"
3251,RETURN OF SPRING,"direction, though he may lose ground by it. Notwithstanding his"
3252,RETURN OF SPRING,"fright, he will take no step which is not beautiful. His pace is a"
3253,RETURN OF SPRING,"sort of leopard canter, as if he were in no wise impeded by the snow,"
3254,RETURN OF SPRING,but were husbanding his strength all the while. When the ground is
3255,RETURN OF SPRING,"uneven, the course is a series of graceful curves, conforming to the"
3256,RETURN OF SPRING,shape of the surface. He runs as though there were not a bone in his
3257,RETURN OF SPRING,"back. Occasionally dropping his muzzle to the ground for a rod or two,"
3258,RETURN OF SPRING,"and then tossing his head aloft, when satisfied of his course. When he"
3259,RETURN OF SPRING,"comes to a declivity, he will put his fore feet together, and slide"
3260,RETURN OF SPRING,"swiftly down it, shoving the snow before him. He treads so softly that"
3261,RETURN OF SPRING,"you would hardly hear it from any nearness, and yet with such"
3262,RETURN OF SPRING,expression that it would not be quite inaudible at any distance.
3263,RETURN OF SPRING,
3264,RETURN OF SPRING,"Of fishes, seventy-five genera and one hundred and seven species are"
3265,RETURN OF SPRING,described in the Report. The fisherman will be startled to learn that
3266,RETURN OF SPRING,there are but about a dozen kinds in the ponds and streams of any
3267,RETURN OF SPRING,inland town; and almost nothing is known of their habits. Only their
3268,RETURN OF SPRING,names and residence make one love fishes. I would know even the number
3269,RETURN OF SPRING,"of their fin-rays, and how many scales compose the lateral line. I am"
3270,RETURN OF SPRING,"the wiser in respect to all knowledges, and the better qualified for"
3271,RETURN OF SPRING,"all fortunes, for knowing that there is a minnow in the brook."
3272,RETURN OF SPRING,"Methinks I have need even of his sympathy, and to be his fellow in a"
3273,RETURN OF SPRING,degree.
3274,RETURN OF SPRING,
3275,RETURN OF SPRING,I have experienced such simple delight in the trivial matters of
3276,RETURN OF SPRING,"fishing and sporting, formerly, as might have inspired the muse of"
3277,RETURN OF SPRING,"Homer or Shakespeare; and now, when I turn the pages and ponder the"
3278,RETURN OF SPRING,"plates of the Angler's Souvenir, I am fain to exclaim,--"
3279,RETURN OF SPRING,
3280,RETURN OF SPRING,"""Can such things be,"
3281,RETURN OF SPRING,"And overcome us like a summer's cloud?"""
3282,RETURN OF SPRING,
3283,RETURN OF SPRING,"Next to nature, it seems as if man's actions were the most natural,"
3284,RETURN OF SPRING,they so gently accord with her. The small seines of flax stretched
3285,RETURN OF SPRING,across the shallow and transparent parts of our river are no more
3286,RETURN OF SPRING,"intrusion than the cobweb in the sun. I stay my boat in mid-current,"
3287,RETURN OF SPRING,"and look down in the sunny water to see the civil meshes of his nets,"
3288,RETURN OF SPRING,and wonder how the blustering people of the town could have done this
3289,RETURN OF SPRING,"elvish work. The twine looks like a new river-weed, and is to the"
3290,RETURN OF SPRING,"river as a beautiful memento of man's presence in nature, discovered"
3291,RETURN OF SPRING,as silently and delicately as a footprint in the sand.
3292,RETURN OF SPRING,
3293,RETURN OF SPRING,"When the ice is covered with snow, I do not suspect the wealth under"
3294,RETURN OF SPRING,my feet; that there is as good as a mine under me wherever I go. How
3295,RETURN OF SPRING,many pickerel are poised on easy fin fathoms below the loaded wain!
3296,RETURN OF SPRING,The revolution of the seasons must be a curious phenomenon to them. At
3297,RETURN OF SPRING,"length the sun and wind brush aside their curtain, and they see the"
3298,RETURN OF SPRING,heavens again.
3299,RETURN OF SPRING,
3300,RETURN OF SPRING,"Early in the spring, after the ice has melted, is the time for"
3301,RETURN OF SPRING,spearing fish. Suddenly the wind shifts from northeast and east to
3302,RETURN OF SPRING,"west and south, and every icicle, which has tinkled on the meadow"
3303,RETURN OF SPRING,"grass so long, trickles down its stem, and seeks its level unerringly"
3304,RETURN OF SPRING,with a million comrades. The steam curls up from every roof and
3305,RETURN OF SPRING,fence.
3306,RETURN OF SPRING,
3307,RETURN OF SPRING,"I see the civil sun drying earth's tears,"
3308,RETURN OF SPRING,"Her tears of joy, which only faster flow."
3309,RETURN OF SPRING,
3310,RETURN OF SPRING,"In the brooks is heard the slight grating sound of small cakes of ice,"
3311,RETURN OF SPRING,"floating with various speed, full of content and promise, and where"
3312,RETURN OF SPRING,"the water gurgles under a natural bridge, you may hear these hasty"
3313,RETURN OF SPRING,rafts hold conversation in an undertone. Every rill is a channel for
3314,RETURN OF SPRING,the juices of the meadow. In the ponds the ice cracks with a merry and
3315,RETURN OF SPRING,"inspiriting din, and down the larger streams is whirled grating"
3316,RETURN OF SPRING,"hoarsely, and crashing its way along, which was so lately a highway"
3317,RETURN OF SPRING,"for the woodman's team and the fox, sometimes with the tracks of the"
3318,RETURN OF SPRING,"skaters still fresh upon it, and the holes cut for pickerel. Town"
3319,RETURN OF SPRING,"committees anxiously inspect the bridges and causeways, as if by mere"
3320,RETURN OF SPRING,eye-force to intercede with the ice and save the treasury.
3321,RETURN OF SPRING,
3322,RETURN OF SPRING,"The river swelleth more and more,"
3323,RETURN OF SPRING,Like some sweet influence stealing o'er
3324,RETURN OF SPRING,The passive town; and for a while
3325,RETURN OF SPRING,"Each tussock makes a tiny isle,"
3326,RETURN OF SPRING,"Where, on some friendly Ararat,"
3327,RETURN OF SPRING,Resteth the weary water-rat.
3328,RETURN OF SPRING,
3329,RETURN OF SPRING,"No ripple shows Musketaquid,"
3330,RETURN OF SPRING,"Her very current e'en is hid,"
3331,RETURN OF SPRING,As deepest souls do calmest rest
3332,RETURN OF SPRING,"When thoughts are swelling in the breast,"
3333,RETURN OF SPRING,And she that in the summer's drought
3334,RETURN OF SPRING,"Doth make a rippling and a rout,"
3335,RETURN OF SPRING,"Sleeps from Nahshawtuck to the Cliff,"
3336,RETURN OF SPRING,Unruffled by a single skiff.
3337,RETURN OF SPRING,But by a thousand distant hills
3338,RETURN OF SPRING,"The louder roar a thousand rills,"
3339,RETURN OF SPRING,"And many a spring which now is dumb,"
3340,RETURN OF SPRING,"And many a stream with smothered hum,"
3341,RETURN OF SPRING,"Doth swifter well and faster glide,"

3343,RETURN OF SPRING,"Our village shows a rural Venice,"
3344,RETURN OF SPRING,Its broad lagoons where yonder fen is;
3345,RETURN OF SPRING,As lovely as the Bay of Naples
3346,RETURN OF SPRING,Yon placid cove amid the maples;
3347,RETURN OF SPRING,And in my neighbor's field of corn
3348,RETURN OF SPRING,I recognize the Golden Horn.
3349,RETURN OF SPRING,
3350,RETURN OF SPRING,"Here Nature taught from year to year,"
3351,RETURN OF SPRING,"When only red men came to hear,--"
3352,RETURN OF SPRING,Methinks 't was in this school of art
3353,RETURN OF SPRING,Venice and Naples learned their part;
3354,RETURN OF SPRING,"But still their mistress, to my mind,"
3355,RETURN OF SPRING,Her young disciples leaves behind.
3356,RETURN OF SPRING,
3357,RETURN OF SPRING,The fisherman now repairs and launches his boat. The best time for
3358,RETURN OF SPRING,"spearing is at this season, before the weeds have begun to grow, and"
3359,RETURN OF SPRING,"while the fishes lie in the shallow water, for in summer they prefer"
3360,RETURN OF SPRING,"the cool depths, and in the autumn they are still more or less"
3361,RETURN OF SPRING,concealed by the grass. The first requisite is fuel for your crate;
3362,RETURN OF SPRING,"and for this purpose the roots of the pitch pine are commonly used,"
3363,RETURN OF SPRING,"found under decayed stumps, where the trees have been felled eight or"
3364,RETURN OF SPRING,ten years.
3365,RETURN OF SPRING,
3366,RETURN OF SPRING,"With a crate, or jack, made of iron hoops, to contain your fire, and"
3367,RETURN OF SPRING,"attached to the bow of your boat about three feet from the water, a"
3368,RETURN OF SPRING,"fish-spear with seven tines and fourteen feet long, a large basket or"
3369,RETURN OF SPRING,"barrow to carry your fuel and bring back your fish, and a thick outer"
3370,RETURN OF SPRING,"garment, you are equipped for a cruise. It should be a warm and still"
3371,RETURN OF SPRING,"evening; and then, with a fire crackling merrily at the prow, you may"
3372,RETURN OF SPRING,launch forth like a cucullo into the night. The dullest soul cannot
3373,RETURN OF SPRING,go upon such an expedition without some of the spirit of adventure; as
3374,RETURN OF SPRING,if he had stolen the boat of Charon and gone down the Styx on a
3375,RETURN OF SPRING,midnight expedition into the realms of Pluto. And much speculation
3376,RETURN OF SPRING,"does this wandering star afford to the musing night-walker, leading"
3377,RETURN OF SPRING,"him on and on, jack-o'-lantern-like, over the meadows; or, if he is"
3378,RETURN OF SPRING,"wiser, he amuses himself with imagining what of human life, far in the"
3379,RETURN OF SPRING,"silent night, is flitting moth-like round its candle. The silent"
3380,RETURN OF SPRING,"navigator shoves his craft gently over the water, with a smothered"
3381,RETURN OF SPRING,"pride and sense of benefaction, as if he were the phosphor, or"
3382,RETURN OF SPRING,"light-bringer, to these dusky realms, or some sister moon, blessing"
3383,RETURN OF SPRING,"the spaces with her light. The waters, for a rod or two on either hand"
3384,RETURN OF SPRING,"and several feet in depth, are lit up with more than noonday"
3385,RETURN OF SPRING,"distinctness, and he enjoys the opportunity which so many have"
3386,RETURN OF SPRING,"desired, for the roofs of a city are indeed raised, and he surveys the"
3387,RETURN OF SPRING,midnight economy of the fishes. There they lie in every variety of
3388,RETURN OF SPRING,"posture; some on their backs, with their white bellies uppermost, some"
3389,RETURN OF SPRING,"suspended in mid-water, some sculling gently along with a dreamy"
3390,RETURN OF SPRING,"motion of the fins, and others quite active and wide awake,--a scene"
3391,RETURN OF SPRING,not unlike what the human city would present. Occasionally he will
3392,RETURN OF SPRING,"encounter a turtle selecting the choicest morsels, or a muskrat"
3393,RETURN OF SPRING,"resting on a tussock. He may exercise his dexterity, if he sees fit,"
3394,RETURN OF SPRING,"on the more distant and active fish, or fork the nearer into his boat,"
3395,RETURN OF SPRING,"as potatoes out of a pot, or even take the sound sleepers with his"
3396,RETURN OF SPRING,hands. But these last accomplishments he will soon learn to dispense
3397,RETURN OF SPRING,"with, distinguishing the real object of his pursuit, and find"
3398,RETURN OF SPRING,compensation in the beauty and never-ending novelty of his position.
3399,RETURN OF SPRING,The pines growing down to the water's edge will show newly as in the
3400,RETURN OF SPRING,glare of a conflagration; and as he floats under the willows with his
3401,RETURN OF SPRING,"light, the song sparrow will often wake on her perch, and sing that"
3402,RETURN OF SPRING,strain at midnight which she had meditated for the morning. And when
3403,RETURN OF SPRING,"he has done, he may have to steer his way home through the dark by the"
3404,RETURN OF SPRING,"north star, and he will feel himself some degrees nearer to it for"
3405,RETURN OF SPRING,having lost his way on the earth.
3406,RETURN OF SPRING,
3407,RETURN OF SPRING,"The fishes commonly taken in this way are pickerel, suckers, perch,"
3408,RETURN OF SPRING,"eels, pouts, breams, and shiners,--from thirty to sixty weight in a"
3409,RETURN OF SPRING,"night. Some are hard to be recognized in the unnatural light,"
3410,RETURN OF SPRING,"especially the perch, which, his dark bands being exaggerated,"
3411,RETURN OF SPRING,"acquires a ferocious aspect. The number of these transverse bands,"
3412,RETURN OF SPRING,"which the Report states to be seven, is, however, very variable, for"
3413,RETURN OF SPRING,in some of our ponds they have nine and ten even.
3414,RETURN OF SPRING,
3415,RETURN OF SPRING,"It appears that we have eight kinds of tortoises, twelve snakes,--but"
3416,RETURN OF SPRING,"one of which is venomous,--nine frogs and toads, nine salamanders, and"
3417,RETURN OF SPRING,"one lizard, for our neighbors."
3418,RETURN OF SPRING,
3419,RETURN OF SPRING,I am particularly attracted by the motions of the serpent tribe. They
3420,RETURN OF SPRING,"make our hands and feet, the wings of the bird, and the fins of the"
3421,RETURN OF SPRING,"fish seem very superfluous, as if Nature had only indulged her fancy"
3422,RETURN OF SPRING,"in making them. The black snake will dart into a bush when pursued,"
3423,RETURN OF SPRING,"and circle round and round with an easy and graceful motion, amid the"
3424,RETURN OF SPRING,"thin and bare twigs, five or six feet from the ground, as a bird flits"
3425,RETURN OF SPRING,"from bough to bough, or hang in festoons between the forks."
3426,RETURN OF SPRING,Elasticity and flexibleness in the simpler forms of animal life are
3427,RETURN OF SPRING,equivalent to a complex system of limbs in the higher; and we have
3428,RETURN OF SPRING,"only to be as wise and wily as the serpent, to perform as difficult"
3429,RETURN OF SPRING,feats without the vulgar assistance of hands and feet.
3430,RETURN OF SPRING,
3431,RETURN OF SPRING,"In May, the snapping turtle (_Emysaurus serpentina_) is frequently"
3432,RETURN OF SPRING,"taken on the meadows and in the river. The fisherman, taking sight"
3433,RETURN OF SPRING,"over the calm surface, discovers its snout projecting above the water,"
3434,RETURN OF SPRING,"at the distance of many rods, and easily secures his prey through its"
3435,RETURN OF SPRING,"unwillingness to disturb the water by swimming hastily away, for,"
3436,RETURN OF SPRING,"gradually drawing its head under, it remains resting on some limb or"
3437,RETURN OF SPRING,"clump of grass. Its eggs, which are buried at a distance from the"
3438,RETURN OF SPRING,"water, in some soft place, as a pigeon-bed, are frequently devoured by"
3439,RETURN OF SPRING,"the skunk. It will catch fish by daylight, as a toad catches flies,"
3440,RETURN OF SPRING,and is said to emit a transparent fluid from its mouth to attract
3441,RETURN OF SPRING,them.
3442,RETURN OF SPRING,
3443,RETURN OF SPRING,Nature has taken more care than the fondest parent for the education
3444,RETURN OF SPRING,and refinement of her children. Consider the silent influence which
3445,RETURN OF SPRING,"flowers exert, no less upon the ditcher in the meadow than the lady in"
3446,RETURN OF SPRING,"the bower. When I walk in the woods, I am reminded that a wise"
3447,RETURN OF SPRING,purveyor has been there before me; my most delicate experience is
3448,RETURN OF SPRING,typified there. I am struck with the pleasing friendships and
3449,RETURN OF SPRING,"unanimities of nature, as when the lichen on the trees takes the form"
3450,RETURN OF SPRING,of their leaves. In the most stupendous scenes you will see delicate
3451,RETURN OF SPRING,"and fragile features, as slight wreaths of vapor, dew-lines, feathery"
3452,RETURN OF SPRING,"sprays, which suggest a high refinement, a noble blood and breeding,"
3453,RETURN OF SPRING,as it were. It is not hard to account for elves and fairies; they
3454,RETURN OF SPRING,"represent this light grace, this ethereal gentility. Bring a spray"
3455,RETURN OF SPRING,"from the wood, or a crystal from the brook, and place it on your"
3456,RETURN OF SPRING,"mantel, and your household ornaments will seem plebeian beside its"
3457,RETURN OF SPRING,"nobler fashion and bearing. It will wave superior there, as if used to"
3458,RETURN OF SPRING,a more refined and polished circle. It has a salute and a response to
3459,RETURN OF SPRING,all your enthusiasm and heroism.
3460,RETURN OF SPRING,
3461,RETURN OF SPRING,"In the winter, I stop short in the path to admire how the trees grow"
3462,RETURN OF SPRING,"up without forethought, regardless of the time and circumstances. They"
3463,RETURN OF SPRING,"do not wait as man does, but now is the golden age of the sapling."
3464,RETURN OF SPRING,"Earth, air, sun, and rain are occasion enough; they were no better in"
3465,RETURN OF SPRING,"primeval centuries. The ""winter of _their_ discontent"" never comes."
3466,RETURN OF SPRING,Witness the buds of the native poplar standing gayly out to the frost
3467,RETURN OF SPRING,on the sides of its bare switches. They express a naked confidence.
3468,RETURN OF SPRING,"With cheerful heart one could be a sojourner in the wilderness, if he"
3469,RETURN OF SPRING,were sure to find there the catkins of the willow or the alder. When I
3470,RETURN OF SPRING,"read of them in the accounts of northern adventurers, by Baffin's Bay"
3471,RETURN OF SPRING,"or Mackenzie's River, I see how even there, too, I could dwell. They"
3472,RETURN OF SPRING,are our little vegetable redeemers. Methinks our virtue will hold out
3473,RETURN OF SPRING,till they come again. They are worthy to have had a greater than
3474,RETURN OF SPRING,Minerva or Ceres for their inventor. Who was the benignant goddess
3475,RETURN OF SPRING,that bestowed them on mankind?
3476,RETURN OF SPRING,
3477,RETURN OF SPRING,"Nature is mythical and mystical always, and works with the license and"
3478,RETURN OF SPRING,extravagance of genius. She has her luxurious and florid style as well
3479,RETURN OF SPRING,"as art. Having a pilgrim's cup to make, she gives to the whole--stem,"
3480,RETURN OF SPRING,"bowl, handle, and nose--some fantastic shape, as if it were to be the"
3481,RETURN OF SPRING,"car of some fabulous marine deity, a Nereus or Triton."
3482,RETURN OF SPRING,
3483,RETURN OF SPRING,"In the winter, the botanist need not confine himself to his books and"
3484,RETURN OF SPRING,"herbarium, and give over his outdoor pursuits, but may study a new"
3485,RETURN OF SPRING,"department of vegetable physiology, what may be called crystalline"
3486,RETURN OF SPRING,"botany, then. The winter of 1837 was unusually favorable for this. In"
3487,RETURN OF SPRING,"December of that year, the Genius of vegetation seemed to hover by"
3488,RETURN OF SPRING,night over its summer haunts with unusual persistency. Such a
3489,RETURN OF SPRING,"hoar-frost as is very uncommon here or anywhere, and whose full"
3490,RETURN OF SPRING,"effects can never be witnessed after sunrise, occurred several times."
3491,RETURN OF SPRING,"As I went forth early on a still and frosty morning, the trees looked"
3492,RETURN OF SPRING,like airy creatures of darkness caught napping; on this side huddled
3493,RETURN OF SPRING,"together, with their gray hairs streaming, in a secluded valley which"
3494,RETURN OF SPRING,"the sun had not penetrated; on that, hurrying off in Indian file along"
3495,RETURN OF SPRING,"some watercourse, while the shrubs and grasses, like elves and fairies"
3496,RETURN OF SPRING,"of the night, sought to hide their diminished heads in the snow. The"
3497,RETURN OF SPRING,"river, viewed from the high bank, appeared of a yellowish-green color,"
3498,RETURN OF SPRING,"though all the landscape was white. Every tree, shrub, and spire of"
3499,RETURN OF SPRING,"grass, that could raise its head above the snow, was covered with a"
3500,RETURN OF SPRING,"dense ice-foliage, answering, as it were, leaf for leaf to its summer"
3501,RETURN OF SPRING,"dress. Even the fences had put forth leaves in the night. The centre,"
3502,RETURN OF SPRING,"diverging, and more minute fibres were perfectly distinct, and the"
3503,RETURN OF SPRING,edges regularly indented. These leaves were on the side of the twig or
3504,RETURN OF SPRING,"stubble opposite to the sun, meeting it for the most part at right"
3505,RETURN OF SPRING,"angles, and there were others standing out at all possible angles upon"
3506,RETURN OF SPRING,"these and upon one another, with no twig or stubble supporting them."
3507,RETURN OF SPRING,"When the first rays of the sun slanted over the scene, the grasses"
3508,RETURN OF SPRING,"seemed hung with innumerable jewels, which jingled merrily as they"
3509,RETURN OF SPRING,"were brushed by the foot of the traveler, and reflected all the hues"
3510,RETURN OF SPRING,"of the rainbow, as he moved from side to side. It struck me that these"
3511,RETURN OF SPRING,"ghost leaves, and the green ones whose forms they assume, were the"
3512,RETURN OF SPRING,creatures of but one law; that in obedience to the same law the
3513,RETURN OF SPRING,"vegetable juices swell gradually into the perfect leaf, on the one"
3514,RETURN OF SPRING,"hand, and the crystalline particles troop to their standard in the"
3515,RETURN OF SPRING,"same order, on the other. As if the material were indifferent, but the"
3516,RETURN OF SPRING,"law one and invariable, and every plant in the spring but pushed up"
3517,RETURN OF SPRING,"into and filled a permanent and eternal mould, which, summer and"
3518,RETURN OF SPRING,"winter forever, is waiting to be filled."
3519,RETURN OF SPRING,
3520,RETURN OF SPRING,This foliate structure is common to the coral and the plumage of
3521,RETURN OF SPRING,"birds, and to how large a part of animate and inanimate nature. The"
3522,RETURN OF SPRING,same independence of law on matter is observable in many other
3523,RETURN OF SPRING,"instances, as in the natural rhymes, when some animal form, color, or"
3524,RETURN OF SPRING,"odor has its counterpart in some vegetable. As, indeed, all rhymes"
3525,RETURN OF SPRING,"imply an eternal melody, independent of any particular sense."
3526,RETURN OF SPRING,
3527,RETURN OF SPRING,As confirmation of the fact that vegetation is but a kind of
3528,RETURN OF SPRING,"crystallization, every one may observe how, upon the edge of the"
3529,RETURN OF SPRING,"melting frost on the window, the needle-shaped particles are bundled"
3530,RETURN OF SPRING,"together so as to resemble fields waving with grain, or shocks rising"
3531,RETURN OF SPRING,here and there from the stubble; on one side the vegetation of the
3532,RETURN OF SPRING,"torrid zone, high-towering palms and wide-spread banyans, such as are"
3533,RETURN OF SPRING,"seen in pictures of oriental scenery; on the other, arctic pines stiff"
3534,RETURN OF SPRING,"frozen, with downcast branches."
3535,RETURN OF SPRING,
3536,RETURN OF SPRING,Vegetation has been made the type of all growth; but as in crystals
3537,RETURN OF SPRING,"the law is more obvious, their material being more simple, and for the"
3538,RETURN OF SPRING,"most part more transient and fleeting, would it not be as"
3539,RETURN OF SPRING,"philosophical as convenient to consider all growth, all filling up"
3540,RETURN OF SPRING,"within the limits of nature, but a crystallization more or less rapid?"
3541,RETURN OF SPRING,
3542,RETURN OF SPRING,"On this occasion, in the side of the high bank of the river, wherever"
3543,RETURN OF SPRING,"the water or other cause had formed a cavity, its throat and outer"
3544,RETURN OF SPRING,"edge, like the entrance to a citadel, bristled with a glistening"
3545,RETURN OF SPRING,"ice-armor. In one place you might see minute ostrich-feathers, which"
3546,RETURN OF SPRING,seemed the waving plumes of the warriors filing into the fortress; in
3547,RETURN OF SPRING,"another, the glancing, fan-shaped banners of the Lilliputian host; and"
3548,RETURN OF SPRING,"in another, the needle-shaped particles collected into bundles,"
3549,RETURN OF SPRING,"resembling the plumes of the pine, might pass for a phalanx of spears."
3550,RETURN OF SPRING,"From the under side of the ice in the brooks, where there was a"
3551,RETURN OF SPRING,"thicker ice below, depended a mass of crystallization, four or five"
3552,RETURN OF SPRING,"inches deep, in the form of prisms, with their lower ends open, which,"
3553,RETURN OF SPRING,"when the ice was laid on its smooth side, resembled the roofs and"
3554,RETURN OF SPRING,"steeples of a Gothic city, or the vessels of a crowded haven under a"
3555,RETURN OF SPRING,"press of canvas. The very mud in the road, where the ice had melted,"
3556,RETURN OF SPRING,"was crystallized with deep rectilinear fissures, and the crystalline"
3557,RETURN OF SPRING,masses in the sides of the ruts resembled exactly asbestos in the
3558,RETURN OF SPRING,disposition of their needles. Around the roots of the stubble and
3559,RETURN OF SPRING,"flower-stalks, the frost was gathered into the form of irregular"
3560,RETURN OF SPRING,"conical shells, or fairy rings. In some places the ice-crystals were"
3561,RETURN OF SPRING,"lying upon granite rocks, directly over crystals of quartz, the"
3562,RETURN OF SPRING,"frostwork of a longer night, crystals of a longer period, but, to some"
3563,RETURN OF SPRING,"eye unprejudiced by the short term of human life, melting as fast as"
3564,RETURN OF SPRING,the former.
3565,RETURN OF SPRING,
3566,RETURN OF SPRING,"In the Report on the Invertebrate Animals, this singular fact is"
3567,RETURN OF SPRING,"recorded, which teaches us to put a new value on time and space: ""The"
3568,RETURN OF SPRING,distribution of the marine shells is well worthy of notice as a
3569,RETURN OF SPRING,"geological fact. Cape Cod, the right arm of the Commonwealth, reaches"
3570,RETURN OF SPRING,"out into the ocean, some fifty or sixty miles. It is nowhere many"
3571,RETURN OF SPRING,miles wide; but this narrow point of land has hitherto proved a
3572,RETURN OF SPRING,barrier to the migrations of many species of Mollusca. Several genera
3573,RETURN OF SPRING,"and numerous species, which are separated by the intervention of only"
3574,RETURN OF SPRING,"a few miles of land, are effectually prevented from mingling by the"
3575,RETURN OF SPRING,"Cape, and do not pass from one side to the other.... Of the one"
3576,RETURN OF SPRING,"hundred and ninety-seven marine species, eighty-three do not pass to"
3577,RETURN OF SPRING,"the south shore, and fifty are not found on the north shore of the"
3578,RETURN OF SPRING,"Cape."""
3579,RETURN OF SPRING,
3580,RETURN OF SPRING,"That common mussel, the _Unio complanatus_, or more properly"
3581,RETURN OF SPRING,"_fluviatilis_, left in the spring by the muskrat upon rocks and"
3582,RETURN OF SPRING,"stumps, appears to have been an important article of food with the"
3583,RETURN OF SPRING,"Indians. In one place, where they are said to have feasted, they are"
3584,RETURN OF SPRING,"found in large quantities, at an elevation of thirty feet above the"
3585,RETURN OF SPRING,"river, filling the soil to the depth of a foot, and mingled with ashes"
3586,RETURN OF SPRING,and Indian remains.
3587,RETURN OF SPRING,
3588,RETURN OF SPRING,"The works we have placed at the head of our chapter, with as much"
3589,RETURN OF SPRING,"license as the preacher selects his text, are such as imply more"
3590,RETURN OF SPRING,labor than enthusiasm. The State wanted complete catalogues of its
3591,RETURN OF SPRING,"natural riches, with such additional facts merely as would be directly"
3592,RETURN OF SPRING,useful.
3593,RETURN OF SPRING,
3594,RETURN OF SPRING,"The reports on Fishes, Reptiles, Insects, and Invertebrate Animals,"
3595,RETURN OF SPRING,"however, indicate labor and research, and have a value independent of"
3596,RETURN OF SPRING,the object of the legislature.
3597,RETURN OF SPRING,
3598,RETURN OF SPRING,"Those on Herbaceous Plants and Birds cannot be of much value, as long"
3599,RETURN OF SPRING,"as Bigelow and Nuttall are accessible. They serve but to indicate,"
3600,RETURN OF SPRING,"with more or less exactness, what species are found in the State. We"
3601,RETURN OF SPRING,"detect several errors ourselves, and a more practiced eye would no"
3602,RETURN OF SPRING,doubt expand the list.
3603,RETURN OF SPRING,
3604,RETURN OF SPRING,The Quadrupeds deserved a more final and instructive report than they
3605,RETURN OF SPRING,have obtained.
3606,RETURN OF SPRING,
3607,RETURN OF SPRING,"These volumes deal much in measurements and minute descriptions, not"
3608,RETURN OF SPRING,"interesting to the general reader, with only here and there a colored"
3609,RETURN OF SPRING,"sentence to allure him, like those plants growing in dark forests,"
3610,RETURN OF SPRING,which bear only leaves without blossoms. But the ground was
3611,RETURN OF SPRING,"comparatively unbroken, and we will not complain of the pioneer, if he"
3612,RETURN OF SPRING,raises no flowers with his first crop. Let us not underrate the value
3613,RETURN OF SPRING,of a fact; it will one day flower in a truth. It is astonishing how
3614,RETURN OF SPRING,few facts of importance are added in a century to the natural history
3615,RETURN OF SPRING,of any animal. The natural history of man himself is still being
3616,RETURN OF SPRING,gradually written. Men are knowing enough after their fashion. Every
3617,RETURN OF SPRING,countryman and dairy-maid knows that the coats of the fourth stomach
3618,RETURN OF SPRING,"of the calf will curdle milk, and what particular mushroom is a safe"
3619,RETURN OF SPRING,"and nutritious diet. You cannot go into any field or wood, but it"
3620,RETURN OF SPRING,"will seem as if every stone had been turned, and the bark on every"
3621,RETURN OF SPRING,"tree ripped up. But, after all, it is much easier to discover than to"
3622,RETURN OF SPRING,"see when the cover is off. It has been well said that ""the attitude of"
3623,RETURN OF SPRING,"inspection is prone."" Wisdom does not inspect, but behold. We must"
3624,RETURN OF SPRING,look a long time before we can see. Slow are the beginnings of
3625,RETURN OF SPRING,"philosophy. He has something demoniacal in him, who can discern a law"
3626,RETURN OF SPRING,"or couple two facts. We can imagine a time when ""Water runs down hill"""
3627,RETURN OF SPRING,may have been taught in the schools. The true man of science will know
3628,RETURN OF SPRING,"nature better by his finer organization; he will smell, taste, see,"
3629,RETURN OF SPRING,"hear, feel, better than other men. His will be a deeper and finer"
3630,RETURN OF SPRING,experience. We do not learn by inference and deduction and the
3631,RETURN OF SPRING,"application of mathematics to philosophy, but by direct intercourse"
3632,RETURN OF SPRING,"and sympathy. It is with science as with ethics,--we cannot know truth"
3633,RETURN OF SPRING,"by contrivance and method; the Baconian is as false as any other, and"
3634,RETURN OF SPRING,"with all the helps of machinery and the arts, the most scientific will"
3635,RETURN OF SPRING,"still be the healthiest and friendliest man, and possess a more"
3636,RETURN OF SPRING,perfect Indian wisdom.

3674,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3675,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Summer and winter our eyes had rested on the dim outline of the
3676,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"mountains in our horizon, to which distance and indistinctness lent a"
3677,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"grandeur not their own, so that they served equally to interpret all"
3678,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the allusions of poets and travelers; whether with Homer, on a spring"
3679,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"morning, we sat down on the many-peaked Olympus, or with Virgil and"
3680,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"his compeers roamed the Etrurian and Thessalian hills, or with"
3681,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Humboldt measured the more modern Andes and Teneriffe. Thus we spoke
3682,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"our mind to them, standing on the Concord cliffs:--"
3683,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3684,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"With frontier strength ye stand your ground,"
3685,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"With grand content ye circle round,"
3686,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Tumultuous silence for all sound,"
3687,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Ye distant nursery of rills,"
3688,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Monadnock, and the Peterboro' hills;"
3689,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Like some vast fleet,"
3690,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Sailing through rain and sleet,"
3691,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Through winter's cold and summer's heat;
3692,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Still holding on, upon your high emprise,"
3693,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Until ye find a shore amid the skies;
3694,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Not skulking close to land,"
3695,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"With cargo contraband,"
3696,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,For they who sent a venture out by ye
3697,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Have set the sun to see
3698,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Their honesty.
3699,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Ships of the line, each one,"
3700,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Ye to the westward run,"
3701,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Always before the gale,"
3702,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Under a press of sail,"
3703,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,With weight of metal all untold.
3704,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"I seem to feel ye, in my firm seat here,"
3705,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Immeasurable depth of hold,"
3706,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And breadth of beam, and length of running gear."
3707,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3708,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Methinks ye take luxurious pleasure
3709,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,In your novel western leisure;
3710,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"So cool your brows, and freshly blue,"
3711,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,As Time had nought for ye to do;
3712,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"For ye lie at your length,"
3713,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"An unappropriated strength,"
3714,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Unhewn primeval timber,"
3715,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"For knees so stiff, for masts so limber;"
3716,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,The stock of which new earths are made
3717,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"One day to be our western trade,"
3718,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Fit for the stanchions of a world
3719,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Which through the seas of space is hurled.
3720,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3721,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"While we enjoy a lingering ray,"
3722,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Ye still o'ertop the western day,"
3723,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Reposing yonder, on God's croft,"
3724,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Like solid stacks of hay.
3725,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Edged with silver, and with gold,"
3726,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The clouds hang o'er in damask fold,"
3727,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,And with such depth of amber light
3728,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The west is dight,"
3729,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Where still a few rays slant,"
3730,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,That even heaven seems extravagant.
3731,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,On the earth's edge mountains and trees
3732,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Stand as they were on air graven,"
3733,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Or as the vessels in a haven
3734,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Await the morning breeze.
3735,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,I fancy even
3736,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Through your defiles windeth the way to heaven;
3737,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And yonder still, in spite of history's page,"
3738,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Linger the golden and the silver age;
3739,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Upon the laboring gale
3740,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The news of future centuries is brought,"
3741,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And of new dynasties of thought,"
3742,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,From your remotest vale.
3743,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3744,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"But special I remember thee,"
3745,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Wachusett, who like me"
3746,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Standest alone without society.
3747,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Thy far blue eye,"
3748,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"A remnant of the sky,"
3749,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Seen through the clearing or the gorge
3750,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Or from the windows of the forge,"
3751,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Doth leaven all it passes by.
3752,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Nothing is true,"
3753,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"But stands 'tween me and you,"
3754,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Thou western pioneer,"
3755,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Who know'st not shame nor fear
3756,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"By venturous spirit driven,"
3757,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Under the eaves of heaven.
3758,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And canst expand thee there,"
3759,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,And breathe enough of air?
3760,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Upholding heaven, holding down earth,"
3761,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Thy pastime from thy birth,"
3762,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Not steadied by the one, nor leaning on the other;"
3763,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,May I approve myself thy worthy brother!
3764,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3765,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,[Illustration: _Mount Wachusett from the Wayland Hills_]
3766,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3767,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"At length, like Rasselas, and other inhabitants of happy valleys, we"
3768,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"resolved to scale the blue wall which bounded the western horizon,"
3769,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,though not without misgivings that thereafter no visible fairyland
3770,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"would exist for us. But we will not leap at once to our journey's end,"
3771,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"though near, but imitate Homer, who conducts his reader over the"
3772,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"plain, and along the resounding sea, though it be but to the tent of"
3773,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Achilles. In the spaces of thought are the reaches of land and water,"
3774,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"where men go and come. The landscape lies far and fair within, and the"
3775,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,deepest thinker is the farthest traveled.
3776,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3777,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"At a cool and early hour on a pleasant morning in July, my companion"
3778,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and I passed rapidly through Acton and Stow, stopping to rest and"
3779,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"refresh us on the bank of a small stream, a tributary of the Assabet,"
3780,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"in the latter town. As we traversed the cool woods of Acton, with"
3781,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"stout staves in our hands, we were cheered by the song of the red-eye,"
3782,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the thrushes, the phoebe, and the cuckoo; and as we passed through"
3783,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the open country, we inhaled the fresh scent of every field, and all"
3784,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"nature lay passive, to be viewed and traveled. Every rail, every"
3785,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"farmhouse, seen dimly in the twilight, every tinkling sound told of"
3786,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"peace and purity, and we moved happily along the dank roads, enjoying"
3787,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"not such privacy as the day leaves when it withdraws, but such as it"
3788,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,has not profaned. It was solitude with light; which is better than
3789,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"darkness. But anon, the sound of the mower's rifle was heard in the"
3790,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"fields, and this, too, mingled with the lowing of kine."
3791,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3792,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"This part of our route lay through the country of hops, which plant"
3793,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"perhaps supplies the want of the vine in American scenery, and may"
3794,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"remind the traveler of Italy and the South of France, whether he"
3795,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"traverses the country when the hop-fields, as then, present solid and"
3796,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"regular masses of verdure, hanging in graceful festoons from pole to"
3797,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"pole, the cool coverts where lurk the gales which refresh the"
3798,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"wayfarer; or in September, when the women and children, and the"
3799,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"neighbors from far and near, are gathered to pick the hops into long"
3800,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"troughs; or later still, when the poles stand piled in vast pyramids"
3801,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"in the yards, or lie in heaps by the roadside."
3802,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3803,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The culture of the hop, with the processes of picking, drying in the"
3804,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"kiln, and packing for the market, as well as the uses to which it is"
3805,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"applied, so analogous to the culture and uses of the grape, may afford"
3806,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,a theme for future poets.
3807,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3808,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,The mower in the adjacent meadow could not tell us the name of the
3809,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"brook on whose banks we had rested, or whether it had any, but his"
3810,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"younger companion, perhaps his brother, knew that it was Great Brook."
3811,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Though they stood very near together in the field, the things they"
3812,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,knew were very far apart; nor did they suspect each other's reserved
3813,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"knowledge, till the stranger came by. In Bolton, while we rested on"
3814,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the rails of a cottage fence, the strains of music which issued from"
3815,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"within, probably in compliment to us, sojourners, reminded us that"
3816,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"thus far men were fed by the accustomed pleasures. So soon did we,"
3817,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"wayfarers, begin to learn that man's life is rounded with the same few"
3818,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"facts, the same simple relations everywhere, and it is vain to travel"
3819,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,to find it new. The flowers grow more various ways than he. But coming
3820,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"soon to higher land, which afforded a prospect of the mountains, we"
3821,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"thought we had not traveled in vain, if it were only to hear a truer"
3822,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,and wilder pronunciation of their names from the lips of the
3823,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"inhabitants; not _Way_-tatic, _Way_-chusett, but _Wor_-tatic,"
3824,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"_Wor_-chusett. It made us ashamed of our tame and civil pronunciation,"
3825,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,and we looked upon them as born and bred farther west than we. Their
3826,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"tongues had a more generous accent than ours, as if breath was cheaper"
3827,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"where they wagged. A countryman, who speaks but seldom, talks"
3828,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"copiously, as it were, as his wife sets cream and cheese before you"
3829,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,without stint. Before noon we had reached the highlands overlooking
3830,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the valley of Lancaster (affording the first fair and open prospect
3831,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"into the west), and there, on the top of a hill, in the shade of some"
3832,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"oaks, near to where a spring bubbled out from a leaden pipe, we rested"
3833,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"during the heat of the day, reading Virgil and enjoying the scenery."
3834,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,It was such a place as one feels to be on the outside of the earth;
3835,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"for from it we could, in some measure, see the form and structure of"
3836,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the globe. There lay Wachusett, the object of our journey, lowering"
3837,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"upon us with unchanged proportions, though with a less ethereal aspect"
3838,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"than had greeted our morning gaze, while further north, in successive"
3839,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"order, slumbered its sister mountains along the horizon."
3840,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3841,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,We could get no further into the Æneid than
3842,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3843,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"-- atque altae moenia Romae,"
3844,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"-- and the wall of high Rome,"
3845,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3846,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,before we were constrained to reflect by what myriad tests a work of
3847,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"genius has to be tried; that Virgil, away in Rome, two thousand years"
3848,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"off, should have to unfold his meaning, the inspiration of Italian"
3849,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"vales, to the pilgrim on New England hills. This life so raw and"
3850,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"modern, that so civil and ancient; and yet we read Virgil mainly to be"
3851,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"reminded of the identity of human nature in all ages, and, by the"
3852,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"poet's own account, we are both the children of a late age, and live"
3853,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,equally under the reign of Jupiter.
3854,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3855,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""He shook honey from the leaves, and removed fire,"
3856,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And stayed the wine, everywhere flowing in rivers;"
3857,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"That experience, by meditating, might invent various arts"
3858,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"By degrees, and seek the blade of corn in furrows,"
3859,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And strike out hidden fire from the veins of the flint."""
3860,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3861,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The old world stands serenely behind the new, as one mountain yonder"
3862,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"towers behind another, more dim and distant. Rome imposes her story"
3863,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,still upon this late generation. The very children in the school we
3864,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"had that morning passed had gone through her wars, and recited her"
3865,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"alarms, ere they had heard of the wars of neighboring Lancaster. The"
3866,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"roving eye still rests inevitably on her hills, and she still holds up"
3867,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the skirts of the sky on that side, and makes the past remote."
3868,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3869,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,The lay of the land hereabouts is well worthy the attention of the
3870,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,traveler. The hill on which we were resting made part of an extensive
3871,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"range, running from southwest to northeast, across the country, and"
3872,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"separating the waters of the Nashua from those of the Concord, whose"
3873,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"banks we had left in the morning, and by bearing in mind this fact, we"
3874,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,could easily determine whither each brook was bound that crossed our
3875,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"path. Parallel to this, and fifteen miles further west, beyond the"
3876,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"deep and broad valley in which lie Groton, Shirley, Lancaster, and"
3877,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Boylston, runs the Wachusett range, in the same general direction. The"
3878,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,descent into the valley on the Nashua side is by far the most sudden;
3879,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and a couple of miles brought us to the southern branch of the Nashua,"
3880,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"a shallow but rapid stream, flowing between high and gravelly banks."
3881,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,But we soon learned that these were no _gelidae valles_ into which we
3882,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"had descended, and, missing the coolness of the morning air, feared it"
3883,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,had become the sun's turn to try his power upon us.
3884,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3885,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""The sultry sun had gained the middle sky,"
3886,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh,"""
3887,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3888,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,and with melancholy pleasure we echoed the melodious plaint of our
3889,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"fellow-traveler, Hassan, in the desert,--"
3890,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3891,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,"
3892,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way."""
3893,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3894,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The air lay lifeless between the hills, as in a seething caldron, with"
3895,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"no leaf stirring, and instead of the fresh odor of grass and clover,"
3896,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"with which we had before been regaled, the dry scent of every herb"
3897,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"seemed merely medicinal. Yielding, therefore, to the heat, we strolled"
3898,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"into the woods, and along the course of a rivulet, on whose banks we"
3899,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"loitered, observing at our leisure the products of these new fields."
3900,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"He who traverses the woodland paths, at this season, will have"
3901,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"occasion to remember the small, drooping, bell-like flowers and"
3902,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"slender red stem of the dogsbane, and the coarser stem and berry of"
3903,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the poke, which are both common in remoter and wilder scenes; and if"
3904,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""the sun casts such a reflecting heat from the sweet-fern"" as makes"
3905,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"him faint, when he is climbing the bare hills, as they complained who"
3906,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"first penetrated into these parts, the cool fragrance of the"
3907,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"swamp-pink restores him again, when traversing the valleys between."
3908,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3909,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"As we went on our way late in the afternoon, we refreshed ourselves by"
3910,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"bathing our feet in every rill that crossed the road, and anon, as we"
3911,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"were able to walk in the shadows of the hills, recovered our morning"
3912,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"elasticity. Passing through Sterling, we reached the banks of the"
3913,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Stillwater, in the western part of the town, at evening, where is a"
3914,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,small village collected. We fancied that there was already a certain
3915,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"western look about this place, a smell of pines and roar of water,"
3916,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"recently confined by dams, belying its name, which were exceedingly"
3917,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"grateful. When the first inroad has been made, a few acres leveled,"
3918,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and a few houses erected, the forest looks wilder than ever. Left to"
3919,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"herself, nature is always more or less civilized, and delights in a"
3920,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,certain refinement; but where the axe has encroached upon the edge of
3921,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the forest, the dead and unsightly limbs of the pine, which she had"
3922,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"concealed with green banks of verdure, are exposed to sight. This"
3923,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"village had, as yet, no post-office, nor any settled name. In the"
3924,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"small villages which we entered, the villagers gazed after us, with a"
3925,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"complacent, almost compassionate look, as if we were just making our"
3926,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"_début_ in the world at a late hour. ""Nevertheless,"" did they seem to"
3927,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"say, ""come and study us, and learn men and manners."" So is each one's"
3928,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"world but a clearing in the forest, so much open and inclosed ground."
3929,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The landlord had not yet returned from the field with his men, and the"
3930,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,cows had yet to be milked. But we remembered the inscription on the
3931,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"wall of the Swedish inn, ""You will find at Trolhate excellent bread,"
3932,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"meat, and wine, provided you bring them with you,"" and were contented."
3933,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"But I must confess it did somewhat disturb our pleasure, in this"
3934,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"withdrawn spot, to have our own village newspaper handed us by our"
3935,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"host, as if the greatest charm the country offered to the traveler was"
3936,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the facility of communication with the town. Let it recline on its own
3937,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"everlasting hills, and not be looking out from their summits for some"
3938,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,petty Boston or New York in the horizon.
3939,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3940,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"At intervals we heard the murmuring of water, and the slumberous"
3941,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"breathing of crickets, throughout the night; and left the inn the next"
3942,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"morning in the gray twilight, after it had been hallowed by the night"
3943,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"air, and when only the innocent cows were stirring, with a kind of"
3944,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"regret. It was only four miles to the base of the mountain, and the"
3945,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,scenery was already more picturesque. Our road lay along the course of
3946,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the Stillwater, which was brawling at the bottom of a deep ravine,"
3947,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"filled with pines and rocks, tumbling fresh from the mountains, so"
3948,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"soon, alas! to commence its career of usefulness. At first, a cloud"
3949,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"hung between us and the summit, but it was soon blown away. As we"
3950,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"gathered the raspberries, which grew abundantly by the roadside, we"
3951,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,fancied that that action was consistent with a lofty prudence; as if
3952,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the traveler who ascends into a mountainous region should fortify
3953,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"himself by eating of such light ambrosial fruits as grow there, and"
3954,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"drinking of the springs which gush out from the mountain-sides, as he"
3955,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,gradually inhales the subtler and purer atmosphere of those elevated
3956,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"places, thus propitiating the mountain gods by a sacrifice of their"
3957,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,own fruits. The gross products of the plains and valleys are for such
3958,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,as dwell therein; but it seemed to us that the juices of this berry
3959,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,had relation to the thin air of the mountain-tops.
3960,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3961,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"In due time we began to ascend the mountain, passing, first, through a"
3962,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"grand sugar maple wood, which bore the marks of the auger, then a"
3963,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"denser forest, which gradually became dwarfed, till there were no"
3964,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,trees whatever. We at length pitched our tent on the summit. It is but
3965,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"nineteen hundred feet above the village of Princeton, and three"
3966,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,thousand above the level of the sea; but by this slight elevation it
3967,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"is infinitely removed from the plain, and when we reached it we felt a"
3968,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"sense of remoteness, as if we had traveled into distant regions, to"
3969,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Arabia Petræa, or the farthest East. A robin upon a staff was the"
3970,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"highest object in sight. Swallows were flying about us, and the"
3971,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,chewink and cuckoo were heard near at hand. The summit consists of a
3972,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"few acres, destitute of trees, covered with bare rocks, interspersed"
3973,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"with blueberry bushes, raspberries, gooseberries, strawberries, moss,"
3974,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and a fine, wiry grass. The common yellow lily and dwarf cornel grow"
3975,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"abundantly in the crevices of the rocks. This clear space, which is"
3976,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"gently rounded, is bounded a few feet lower by a thick shrubbery of"
3977,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"oaks, with maples, aspens, beeches, cherries, and occasionally a"
3978,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"mountain-ash intermingled, among which we found the bright blue"
3979,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"berries of the Solomon's-seal, and the fruit of the pyrola. From the"
3980,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"foundation of a wooden observatory, which was formerly erected on the"
3981,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"highest point, forming a rude, hollow structure of stone, a dozen feet"
3982,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"in diameter, and five or six in height, we could see Monadnock, in"
3983,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"simple grandeur, in the northwest, rising nearly a thousand feet"
3984,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"higher, still the ""far blue mountain,"" though with an altered profile."
3985,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,The first day the weather was so hazy that it was in vain we
3986,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,endeavored to unravel the obscurity. It was like looking into the sky
3987,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"again, and the patches of forest here and there seemed to flit like"
3988,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"clouds over a lower heaven. As to voyagers of an aerial Polynesia, the"
3989,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"earth seemed like a larger island in the ether; on every side, even as"
3990,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"low as we, the sky shutting down, like an unfathomable deep, around"
3991,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"it, a blue Pacific island, where who knows what islanders inhabit? and"
3992,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,as we sail near its shores we see the waving of trees and hear the
3993,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,lowing of kine.
3994,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3995,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"We read Virgil and Wordsworth in our tent, with new pleasure there,"
3996,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"while waiting for a clearer atmosphere, nor did the weather prevent"
3997,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,our appreciating the simple truth and beauty of Peter Bell:--
3998,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
3999,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""And he had lain beside his asses,"
4000,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,On lofty Cheviot Hills:
4001,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4002,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales,"
4003,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Among the rocks and winding _scars_;
4004,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Where deep and low the hamlets lie
4005,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Beneath their little patch of sky
4006,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And little lot of stars."""
4007,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4008,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Who knows but this hill may one day be a Helvellyn, or even a"
4009,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Parnassus, and the Muses haunt here, and other Homers frequent the"
4010,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,neighboring plains?
4011,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4012,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Not unconcerned Wachusett rears his head
4013,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Above the field, so late from nature won,"
4014,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"With patient brow reserved, as one who read"
4015,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,New annals in the history of man.
4016,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4017,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The blueberries which the mountain afforded, added to the milk we had"
4018,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"brought, made our frugal supper, while for entertainment the even-song"
4019,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,of the wood thrush rang along the ridge. Our eyes rested on no painted
4020,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"ceiling nor carpeted hall, but on skies of Nature's painting, and"
4021,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"hills and forests of her embroidery. Before sunset, we rambled along"
4022,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the ridge to the north, while a hawk soared still above us. It was a"
4023,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"place where gods might wander, so solemn and solitary, and removed"
4024,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"from all contagion with the plain. As the evening came on, the haze"
4025,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"was condensed in vapor, and the landscape became more distinctly"
4026,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"visible, and numerous sheets of water were brought to light."
4027,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4028,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant,"
4029,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae."""
4030,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4031,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And now the tops of the villas smoke afar off,"
4032,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,And the shadows fall longer from the high mountains.
4033,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4034,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"As we stood on the stone tower while the sun was setting, we saw the"
4035,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,shades of night creep gradually over the valleys of the east; and the
4036,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"inhabitants went into their houses, and shut their doors, while the"
4037,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"moon silently rose up, and took possession of that part. And then the"
4038,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"same scene was repeated on the west side, as far as the Connecticut"
4039,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and the Green Mountains, and the sun's rays fell on us two alone, of"
4040,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,all New England men.
4041,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4042,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"It was the night but one before the full of the moon, so bright that"
4043,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"we could see to read distinctly by moonlight, and in the evening"
4044,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"strolled over the summit without danger. There was, by chance, a fire"
4045,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"blazing on Monadnock that night, which lighted up the whole western"
4046,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"horizon, and, by making us aware of a community of mountains, made our"
4047,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,position seem less solitary. But at length the wind drove us to the
4048,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"shelter of our tent, and we closed its door for the night, and fell"
4049,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,asleep.
4050,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4051,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"It was thrilling to hear the wind roar over the rocks, at intervals"
4052,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"when we waked, for it had grown quite cold and windy. The night was,"
4053,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"in its elements, simple even to majesty in that bleak place,--a bright"
4054,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,moonlight and a piercing wind. It was at no time darker than twilight
4055,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"within the tent, and we could easily see the moon through its"
4056,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"transparent roof as we lay; for there was the moon still above us,"
4057,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"with Jupiter and Saturn on either hand, looking down on Wachusett, and"
4058,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,it was a satisfaction to know that they were our fellow-travelers
4059,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"still, as high and out of our reach as our own destiny. Truly the"
4060,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,stars were given for a consolation to man. We should not know but our
4061,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"life were fated to be always groveling, but it is permitted to behold"
4062,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"them, and surely they are deserving of a fair destiny. We see laws"
4063,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"which never fail, of whose failure we never conceived; and their lamps"
4064,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"burn all the night, too, as well as all day,--so rich and lavish is"
4065,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,that nature which can afford this superfluity of light.
4066,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4067,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"The morning twilight began as soon as the moon had set, and we arose"
4068,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and kindled our fire, whose blaze might have been seen for thirty"
4069,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"miles around. As the daylight increased, it was remarkable how rapidly"
4070,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the wind went down. There was no dew on the summit, but coldness"
4071,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"supplied its place. When the dawn had reached its prime, we enjoyed"
4072,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the view of a distinct horizon line, and could fancy ourselves at sea,"
4073,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and the distant hills the waves in the horizon, as seen from the deck"
4074,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"of a vessel. The cherry-birds flitted around us, the nuthatch and"
4075,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"flicker were heard among the bushes, the titmouse perched within a few"
4076,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"feet, and the song of the wood thrush again rang along the ridge. At"
4077,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"length we saw the run rise up out of the sea, and shine on"
4078,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,Massachusetts; and from this moment the atmosphere grew more and more
4079,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"transparent till the time of our departure, and we began to realize"
4080,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the extent of the view, and how the earth, in some degree, answered to"
4081,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the heavens in breadth, the white villages to the constellations in"
4082,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the sky. There was little of the sublimity and grandeur which belong
4083,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"to mountain scenery, but an immense landscape to ponder on a summer's"
4084,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,day. We could see how ample and roomy is nature. As far as the eye
4085,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,could reach there was little life in the landscape; the few birds
4086,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"that flitted past did not crowd. The travelers on the remote highways,"
4087,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"which intersect the country on every side, had no fellow-travelers for"
4088,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"miles, before or behind. On every side, the eye ranged over successive"
4089,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"circles of towns, rising one above another, like the terraces of a"
4090,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"vineyard, till they were lost in the horizon. Wachusett is, in fact,"
4091,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the observatory of the State. There lay Massachusetts, spread out"
4092,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"before us in its length and breadth, like a map. There was the level"
4093,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"horizon which told of the sea on the east and south, the well-known"
4094,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"hills of New Hampshire on the north, and the misty summits of the"
4095,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Hoosac and Green Mountains, first made visible to us the evening"
4096,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"before, blue and unsubstantial, like some bank of clouds which the"
4097,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"morning wind would dissipate, on the northwest and west. These last"
4098,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"distant ranges, on which the eye rests unwearied, commence with an"
4099,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"abrupt boulder in the north, beyond the Connecticut, and travel"
4100,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"southward, with three or four peaks dimly seen. But Monadnock, rearing"
4101,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"its masculine front in the northwest, is the grandest feature. As we"
4102,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"beheld it, we knew that it was the height of land between the two"
4103,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"rivers, on this side the valley of the Merrimack, on that of the"
4104,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Connecticut, fluctuating with their blue seas of air,--these rival"
4105,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"vales, already teeming with Yankee men along their respective streams,"
4106,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,born to what destiny who shall tell? Watatic and the neighboring
4107,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"hills, in this State and in New Hampshire, are a continuation of the"
4108,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,same elevated range on which we were standing. But that New Hampshire
4109,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"bluff,--that promontory of a State,--lowering day and night on this"
4110,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"our State of Massachusetts, will longest haunt our dreams."
4111,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4112,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"We could at length realize the place mountains occupy on the land, and"
4113,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,how they come into the general scheme of the universe. When first we
4114,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"climb their summits and observe their lesser irregularities, we do not"
4115,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,give credit to the comprehensive intelligence which shaped them; but
4116,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"when afterward we behold their outlines in the horizon, we confess"
4117,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"that the hand which moulded their opposite slopes, making one to"
4118,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"balance the other, worked round a deep centre, and was privy to the"
4119,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,plan of the universe. So is the least part of nature in its bearings
4120,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"referred to all space. These lesser mountain ranges, as well as the"
4121,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Alleghanies, run from northeast to southwest, and parallel with these"
4122,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"mountain streams are the more fluent rivers, answering to the general"
4123,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"direction of the coast, the bank of the great ocean stream itself."
4124,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Even the clouds, with their thin bars, fall into the same direction by"
4125,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"preference, and such even is the course of the prevailing winds, and"
4126,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the migration of men and birds. A mountain chain determines many
4127,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,things for the statesman and philosopher. The improvements of
4128,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,civilization rather creep along its sides than cross its summit. How
4129,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,often is it a barrier to prejudice and fanaticism! In passing over
4130,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"these heights of land, through their thin atmosphere, the follies of"
4131,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,the plain are refined and purified; and as many species of plants do
4132,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"not scale their summits, so many species of folly, no doubt, do not"
4133,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,cross the Alleghanies; it is only the hardy mountain-plant that creeps
4134,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"quite over the ridge, and descends into the valley beyond."
4135,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4136,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"We get a dim notion of the flight of birds, especially of such as fly"
4137,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"high in the air, by having ascended a mountain. We can now see what"
4138,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,landmarks mountains are to their migrations; how the Catskills and
4139,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Highlands have hardly sunk to them, when Wachusett and Monadnock open"
4140,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"a passage to the northeast; how they are guided, too, in their course"
4141,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"by the rivers and valleys; and who knows but by the stars, as well as"
4142,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the mountain ranges, and not by the petty landmarks which we use. The"
4143,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"bird whose eye takes in the Green Mountains on the one side, and the"
4144,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"ocean on the other, need not be at a loss to find its way."
4145,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4146,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"At noon we descended the mountain, and, having returned to the abodes"
4147,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"of men, turned our faces to the east again; measuring our progress,"
4148,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"from time to time, by the more ethereal hues which the mountain"
4149,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"assumed. Passing swiftly through Stillwater and Sterling, as with a"
4150,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"downward impetus, we found ourselves almost at home again in the green"
4151,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"meadows of Lancaster, so like our own Concord, for both are watered by"
4152,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"two streams which unite near their centres, and have many other"
4153,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,features in common. There is an unexpected refinement about this
4154,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"scenery; level prairies of great extent, interspersed with elms and"
4155,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"hop-fields and groves of trees, give it almost a classic appearance."
4156,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"This, it will be remembered, was the scene of Mrs. Rowlandson's"
4157,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"capture, and of other events in the Indian wars, but from this July"
4158,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"afternoon, and under that mild exterior, those times seemed as remote"
4159,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,as the irruption of the Goths. They were the dark age of New England.
4160,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"On beholding a picture of a New England village as it then appeared,"
4161,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"with a fair open prospect, and a light on trees and river, as if it"
4162,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"were broad noon, we find we had not thought the sun shone in those"
4163,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"days, or that men lived in broad daylight then. We do not imagine the"
4164,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"sun shining on hill and valley during Philip's war, nor on the"
4165,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"war-path of Paugus, or Standish, or Church, or Lovell, with serene"
4166,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"summer weather, but a dim twilight or night did those events transpire"
4167,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,in. They must have fought in the shade of their own dusky deeds.
4168,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4169,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"At length, as we plodded along the dusty roads, our thoughts became as"
4170,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"dusty as they; all thought indeed stopped, thinking broke down, or"
4171,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,proceeded only passively in a sort of rhythmical cadence of the
4172,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"confused material of thought, and we found ourselves mechanically"
4173,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,repeating some familiar measure which timed with our tread; some verse
4174,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"of the Robin Hood ballads, for instance, which one can recommend to"
4175,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,travel by:--
4176,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4177,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""Sweavens are swift, sayd lyttle John,"
4178,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,As the wind blows over the hill;
4179,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"For if it be never so loud this night,"
4180,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"To-morrow it may be still."""
4181,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4182,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And so it went, up-hill and down, till a stone interrupted the line,"
4183,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,when a new verse was chosen:--
4184,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4185,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"""His shoote it was but loosely shott,"
4186,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine,"
4187,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"For it mett one of the sheriffe's men,"
4188,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And William a Trent was slaine."""
4189,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4190,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"There is, however, this consolation to the most wayworn traveler, upon"
4191,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the dustiest road, that the path his feet describe is so perfectly"
4192,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"symbolical of human life,--now climbing the hills, now descending into"
4193,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the vales. From the summits he beholds the heavens and the horizon,"
4194,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,from the vales he looks up to the heights again. He is treading his
4195,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"old lessons still, and though he may be very weary and travel-worn, it"
4196,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,is yet sincere experience.
4197,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4198,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Leaving the Nashua, we changed our route a little, and arrived at"
4199,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"Stillriver Village, in the western part of Harvard, just as the sun"
4200,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"was setting. From this place, which lies to the northward, upon the"
4201,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,western slope of the same range of hills on which we had spent the
4202,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"noon before, in the adjacent town, the prospect is beautiful, and the"
4203,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,grandeur of the mountain outlines unsurpassed. There was such a repose
4204,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"and quiet here at this hour, as if the very hillsides were enjoying"
4205,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"the scene; and as we passed slowly along, looking back over the"
4206,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"country we had traversed, and listening to the evening song of the"
4207,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"robin, we could not help contrasting the equanimity of Nature with the"
4208,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,bustle and impatience of man. His words and actions presume always a
4209,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"crisis near at hand, but she is forever silent and unpretending."
4210,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4211,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"And now that we have returned to the desultory life of the plain, let"
4212,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,us endeavor to import a little of that mountain grandeur into it. We
4213,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"will remember within what walls we lie, and understand that this level"
4214,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"life too has its summit, and why from the mountain-top the deepest"
4215,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"valleys have a tinge of blue; that there is elevation in every hour,"
4216,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,as no part of the earth is so low that the heavens may not be seen
4217,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"from, and we have only to stand on the summit of our hour to command"
4218,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,an uninterrupted horizon.
4219,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4220,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"We rested that night at Harvard, and the next morning, while one bent"
4221,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"his steps to the nearer village of Groton, the other took his"
4222,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,separate and solitary way to the peaceful meadows of Concord; but let
4223,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,him not forget to record the brave hospitality of a farmer and his
4224,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"wife, who generously entertained him at their board, though the poor"
4225,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,wayfarer could only congratulate the one on the continuance of hay
4226,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"weather, and silently accept the kindness of the other. Refreshed by"
4227,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"this instance of generosity, no less than by the substantial viands"
4228,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,"set before him, he pushed forward with new vigor, and reached the"
4229,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,banks of the Concord before the sun had climbed many degrees into the
4230,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,heavens.
4231,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4232,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4233,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4234,A WALK TO WACHUSETT,
4235,THE LANDLORD,THE LANDLORD
4236,THE LANDLORD,
4237,THE LANDLORD,
4238,THE LANDLORD,"Under the one word ""house"" are included the schoolhouse, the"
4239,THE LANDLORD,"almshouse, the jail, the tavern, the dwelling-house; and the meanest"
4240,THE LANDLORD,shed or cave in which men live contains the elements of all these. But
4241,THE LANDLORD,nowhere on the earth stands the entire and perfect house. The
4242,THE LANDLORD,"Parthenon, St. Peter's, the Gothic minster, the palace, the hovel, are"
4243,THE LANDLORD,but imperfect executions of an imperfect idea. Who would dwell in
4244,THE LANDLORD,them? Perhaps to the eye of the gods the cottage is more holy than the
4245,THE LANDLORD,"Parthenon, for they look down with no especial favor upon the shrines"
4246,THE LANDLORD,"formally dedicated to them, and that should be the most sacred roof"
4247,THE LANDLORD,"which shelters most of humanity. Surely, then, the gods who are most"
4248,THE LANDLORD,"interested in the human race preside over the Tavern, where especially"
4249,THE LANDLORD,men congregate. Methinks I see the thousand shrines erected to
4250,THE LANDLORD,"Hospitality shining afar in all countries, as well Mahometan and"
4251,THE LANDLORD,"Jewish as Christian, khans and caravansaries and inns, whither all"
4252,THE LANDLORD,pilgrims without distinction resort.
4253,THE LANDLORD,
4254,THE LANDLORD,"Likewise we look in vain, east or west over the earth, to find the"
4255,THE LANDLORD,perfect man; but each represents only some particular excellence. The
4256,THE LANDLORD,"Landlord is a man of more open and general sympathies, who possesses a"
4257,THE LANDLORD,"spirit of hospitality which is its own reward, and feeds and shelters"
4258,THE LANDLORD,"men from pure love of the creatures. To be sure, this profession is as"
4259,THE LANDLORD,"often filled by imperfect characters, and such as have sought it from"
4260,THE LANDLORD,"unworthy motives, as any other, but so much the more should we prize"
4261,THE LANDLORD,the true and honest Landlord when we meet with him.
4262,THE LANDLORD,
4263,THE LANDLORD,"Who has not imagined to himself a country inn, where the traveler"
4264,THE LANDLORD,"shall really feel _in_, and at home, and at his public house, who was"
4265,THE LANDLORD,"before at his private house?--whose host is indeed a _host_, and a"
4266,THE LANDLORD,"_lord_ of the _land_, a self-appointed brother of his race; called to"
4267,THE LANDLORD,"his place, beside, by all the winds of heaven and his good genius, as"
4268,THE LANDLORD,truly as the preacher is called to preach; a man of such universal
4269,THE LANDLORD,"sympathies, and so broad and genial a human nature, that he would fain"
4270,THE LANDLORD,"sacrifice the tender but narrow ties of private friendship to a broad,"
4271,THE LANDLORD,"sunshiny, fair-weather-and-foul friendship for his race; who loves"
4272,THE LANDLORD,"men, not as a philosopher, with philanthropy, nor as an overseer of"
4273,THE LANDLORD,"the poor, with charity, but by a necessity of his nature, as he loves"
4274,THE LANDLORD,dogs and horses; and standing at his open door from morning till night
4275,THE LANDLORD,"would fain see more and more of them come along the highway, and is"
4276,THE LANDLORD,"never satiated. To him the sun and moon are but travelers, the one by"
4277,THE LANDLORD,day and the other by night; and they too patronize his house. To his
4278,THE LANDLORD,imagination all things travel save his sign-post and himself; and
4279,THE LANDLORD,"though you may be his neighbor for years, he will show you only the"
4280,THE LANDLORD,"civilities of the road. But on the other hand, while nations and"
4281,THE LANDLORD,"individuals are alike selfish and exclusive, he loves all men equally;"
4282,THE LANDLORD,"and if he treats his nearest neighbor as a stranger, since he has"
4283,THE LANDLORD,"invited all nations to share his hospitality, the farthest-traveled is"
4284,THE LANDLORD,in some measure kindred to him who takes him into the bosom of his
4285,THE LANDLORD,family.
4286,THE LANDLORD,
4287,THE LANDLORD,He keeps a house of entertainment at the sign of the Black Horse or
4288,THE LANDLORD,"the Spread Eagle, and is known far and wide, and his fame travels with"
4289,THE LANDLORD,"increasing radius every year. All the neighborhood is in his interest,"
4290,THE LANDLORD,"and if the traveler ask how far to a tavern, he receives some such"
4291,THE LANDLORD,"answer as this: ""Well, sir, there's a house about three miles from"
4292,THE LANDLORD,"here, where they haven't taken down their sign yet; but it's only ten"
4293,THE LANDLORD,"miles to Slocum's, and that's a capital house, both for man and"
4294,THE LANDLORD,"beast."" At three miles he passes a cheerless barrack, standing"
4295,THE LANDLORD,"desolate behind its sign-post, neither public nor private, and has"
4296,THE LANDLORD,glimpses of a discontented couple who have mistaken their calling. At
4297,THE LANDLORD,"ten miles see where the Tavern stands,--really an _entertaining_"
4298,THE LANDLORD,"prospect,--so public and inviting that only the rain and snow do not"
4299,THE LANDLORD,"enter. It is no gay pavilion, made of bright stuffs, and furnished"
4300,THE LANDLORD,"with nuts and gingerbread, but as plain and sincere as a caravansary;"
4301,THE LANDLORD,"located in no Tarrytown, where you receive only the civilities of"
4302,THE LANDLORD,"commerce, but far in the fields it exercises a primitive hospitality,"
4303,THE LANDLORD,"amid the fresh scent of new hay and raspberries, if it be summer-time,"
4304,THE LANDLORD,and the tinkling of cow-bells from invisible pastures; for it is a
4305,THE LANDLORD,"land flowing with milk and honey, and the newest milk courses in a"
4306,THE LANDLORD,"broad, deep stream across the premises."
4307,THE LANDLORD,
4308,THE LANDLORD,In these retired places the tavern is first of all a
4309,THE LANDLORD,"house,--elsewhere, last of all, or never,--and warms and shelters its"
4310,THE LANDLORD,inhabitants. It is as simple and sincere in its essentials as the
4311,THE LANDLORD,"caves in which the first men dwelt, but it is also as open and public."
4312,THE LANDLORD,"The traveler steps across the threshold, and lo! he too is master, for"
4313,THE LANDLORD,he only can be called proprietor of the house here who behaves with
4314,THE LANDLORD,"most propriety in it. The Landlord stands clear back in nature, to my"
4315,THE LANDLORD,"imagination, with his axe and spade felling trees and raising potatoes"
4316,THE LANDLORD,with the vigor of a pioneer; with Promethean energy making nature
4317,THE LANDLORD,yield her increase to supply the wants of so many; and he is not so
4318,THE LANDLORD,"exhausted, nor of so short a stride, but that he comes forward even to"
4319,THE LANDLORD,"the highway to this wide hospitality and publicity. Surely, he has"
4320,THE LANDLORD,"solved some of the problems of life. He comes in at his back door,"
4321,THE LANDLORD,holding a log fresh cut for the hearth upon his shoulder with one
4322,THE LANDLORD,"hand, while he greets the newly arrived traveler with the other."
4323,THE LANDLORD,
4324,THE LANDLORD,"Here at length we have free range, as not in palaces, nor cottages,"
4325,THE LANDLORD,"nor temples, and intrude nowhere. All the secrets of housekeeping are"
4326,THE LANDLORD,"exhibited to the eyes of men, above and below, before and behind. This"
4327,THE LANDLORD,"is the necessary way to live, men have confessed, in these days, and"
4328,THE LANDLORD,shall he skulk and hide? And why should we have any serious disgust at
4329,THE LANDLORD,kitchens? Perhaps they are the holiest recess of the house. There is
4330,THE LANDLORD,"the hearth, after all,--and the settle, and the fagots, and the"
4331,THE LANDLORD,"kettle, and the crickets. We have pleasant reminiscences of these."
4332,THE LANDLORD,"They are the heart, the left ventricle, the very vital part of the"
4333,THE LANDLORD,house. Here the real and sincere life which we meet in the streets was
4334,THE LANDLORD,actually fed and sheltered. Here burns the taper that cheers the
4335,THE LANDLORD,"lonely traveler by night, and from this hearth ascend the smokes that"
4336,THE LANDLORD,"populate the valley to his eyes by day. On the whole, a man may not be"
4337,THE LANDLORD,"so little ashamed of any other part of his house, for here is his"
4338,THE LANDLORD,"sincerity and earnest, at least. It may not be here that the besoms"
4339,THE LANDLORD,"are plied most,--it is not here that they need to be, for dust will"
4340,THE LANDLORD,not settle on the kitchen floor more than in nature.
4341,THE LANDLORD,
4342,THE LANDLORD,Hence it will not do for the Landlord to possess too fine a nature. He
4343,THE LANDLORD,"must have health above the common accidents of life, subject to no"
4344,THE LANDLORD,"modern fashionable diseases; but no taste, rather a vast relish or"
4345,THE LANDLORD,appetite. His sentiments on all subjects will be delivered as freely
4346,THE LANDLORD,"as the wind blows; there is nothing private or individual in them,"
4347,THE LANDLORD,"though still original, but they are public, and of the hue of the"
4348,THE LANDLORD,"heavens over his house,--a certain out-of-door obviousness and"
4349,THE LANDLORD,"transparency not to be disputed. What he does, his manners are not to"
4350,THE LANDLORD,"be complained of, though abstractly offensive, for it is what man"
4351,THE LANDLORD,"does, and in him the race is exhibited. When he eats, he is liver and"
4352,THE LANDLORD,"bowels and the whole digestive apparatus to the company, and so all"
4353,THE LANDLORD,"admit the thing is done. He must have no idiosyncrasies, no particular"
4354,THE LANDLORD,"bents or tendencies to this or that, but a general, uniform, and"
4355,THE LANDLORD,"healthy development, such as his portly person indicates, offering"
4356,THE LANDLORD,himself equally on all sides to men. He is not one of your peaked and
4357,THE LANDLORD,"inhospitable men of genius, with particular tastes, but, as we said"
4358,THE LANDLORD,"before, has one uniform relish, and taste which never aspires higher"
4359,THE LANDLORD,"than a tavern-sign, or the cut of a weather-cock. The man of genius,"
4360,THE LANDLORD,"like a dog with a bone, or the slave who has swallowed a diamond, or a"
4361,THE LANDLORD,"patient with the gravel, sits afar and retired, off the road, hangs"
4362,THE LANDLORD,"out no sign of refreshment for man and beast, but says, by all"
4363,THE LANDLORD,"possible hints and signs, I wish to be alone,--good-by,--farewell. But"
4364,THE LANDLORD,the Landlord can afford to live without privacy. He entertains no
4365,THE LANDLORD,"private thought, he cherishes no solitary hour, no Sabbath-day, but"
4366,THE LANDLORD,"thinks,--enough to assert the dignity of reason,--and talks, and reads"
4367,THE LANDLORD,the newspaper. What he does not tell to one traveler he tells to
4368,THE LANDLORD,"another. He never wants to be alone, but sleeps, wakes, eats, drinks,"
4369,THE LANDLORD,"sociably, still remembering his race. He walks abroad through the"
4370,THE LANDLORD,"thoughts of men, and the Iliad and Shakespeare are tame to him, who"
4371,THE LANDLORD,hears the rude but homely incidents of the road from every traveler.
4372,THE LANDLORD,The mail might drive through his brain in the midst of his most lonely
4373,THE LANDLORD,"soliloquy without disturbing his equanimity, provided it brought"
4374,THE LANDLORD,plenty of news and passengers. There can be no _pro_fanity where there
4375,THE LANDLORD,"is no fane behind, and the whole world may see quite round him."
4376,THE LANDLORD,"Perchance his lines have fallen to him in dustier places, and he has"
4377,THE LANDLORD,"heroically sat down where two roads meet, or at the Four Corners or"
4378,THE LANDLORD,"the Five Points, and his life is sublimely trivial for the good of"
4379,THE LANDLORD,"men. The dust of travel blows ever in his eyes, and they preserve"
4380,THE LANDLORD,"their clear, complacent look. The hourlies and half-hourlies, the"
4381,THE LANDLORD,"dailies and weeklies, whirl on well-worn tracks, round and round his"
4382,THE LANDLORD,"house, as if it were the goal in the stadium, and still he sits within"
4383,THE LANDLORD,"in unruffled serenity, with no show of retreat. His neighbor dwells"
4384,THE LANDLORD,"timidly behind a screen of poplars and willows, and a fence with"
4385,THE LANDLORD,"sheaves of spears at regular intervals, or defended against the tender"
4386,THE LANDLORD,"palms of visitors by sharp spikes,--but the traveler's wheels rattle"
4387,THE LANDLORD,"over the door-step of the tavern, and he cracks his whip in the entry."
4388,THE LANDLORD,"He is truly glad to see you, and sincere as the bull's-eye over his"
4389,THE LANDLORD,"door. The traveler seeks to find, wherever he goes, some one who will"
4390,THE LANDLORD,"stand in this broad and catholic relation to him, who will be an"
4391,THE LANDLORD,"inhabitant of the land to him a stranger, and represent its human"
4392,THE LANDLORD,"nature, as the rock stands for its inanimate nature; and this is he."
4393,THE LANDLORD,"As his crib furnishes provender for the traveler's horse, and his"
4394,THE LANDLORD,"larder provisions for his appetite, so his conversation furnishes the"
4395,THE LANDLORD,"necessary aliment to his spirits. He knows very well what a man wants,"
4396,THE LANDLORD,"for he is a man himself, and as it were the farthest-traveled, though"
4397,THE LANDLORD,he has never stirred from his door. He understands his needs and
4398,THE LANDLORD,"destiny. He would be well fed and lodged, there can be no doubt, and"
4399,THE LANDLORD,"have the transient sympathy of a cheerful companion, and of a heart"
4400,THE LANDLORD,"which always prophesies fair weather. And after all the greatest men,"
4401,THE LANDLORD,"even, want much more the sympathy which every honest fellow can give,"
4402,THE LANDLORD,than that which the great only can impart. If he is not the most
4403,THE LANDLORD,"upright, let us allow him this praise, that he is the most downright"
4404,THE LANDLORD,"of men. He has a hand to shake and to be shaken, and takes a sturdy"
4405,THE LANDLORD,"and unquestionable interest in you, as if he had assumed the care of"
4406,THE LANDLORD,"you, but if you will break your neck, he will even give you the best"
4407,THE LANDLORD,advice as to the method.
4408,THE LANDLORD,
4409,THE LANDLORD,The great poets have not been ungrateful to their landlords. Mine host
4410,THE LANDLORD,"of the Tabard Inn, in the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, was an"
4411,THE LANDLORD,honor to his profession:--
4412,THE LANDLORD,
4413,THE LANDLORD,"""A semely man our Hoste was, with alle,"
4414,THE LANDLORD,For to han been a marshal in an halle.
4415,THE LANDLORD,"A large man he was, with eyen stepe;"
4416,THE LANDLORD,A fairer burgeis was ther non in Chepe:
4417,THE LANDLORD,"Bold of his speche, and wise, and well ytaught,"
4418,THE LANDLORD,And of manhood him lacked righte naught.
4419,THE LANDLORD,"Eke thereto was he right a mery man,"
4420,THE LANDLORD,"And after souper plaien he began,"
4421,THE LANDLORD,"And spake of mirthe amonges other thinges,"
4422,THE LANDLORD,"Whan that we hadden made our reckoninges."""
4423,THE LANDLORD,
4424,THE LANDLORD,"He is the true house-band, and centre of the company,--of greater"
4425,THE LANDLORD,fellowship and practical social talent than any. He it is that
4426,THE LANDLORD,proposes that each shall tell a tale to while away the time to
4427,THE LANDLORD,"Canterbury, and leads them himself, and concludes with his own tale,--"
4428,THE LANDLORD,
4429,THE LANDLORD,"""Now, by my fader's soule that is ded,"
4430,THE LANDLORD,"But ye be mery, smiteth of my hed:"
4431,THE LANDLORD,"Hold up your hondes withouten more speche."""
4432,THE LANDLORD,
4433,THE LANDLORD,"If we do not look up to the Landlord, we look round for him on all"
4434,THE LANDLORD,"emergencies, for he is a man of infinite experience, who unites hands"
4435,THE LANDLORD,"with wit. He is a more public character than a statesman,--a publican,"
4436,THE LANDLORD,"and not consequently a sinner; and surely, he, if any, should be"
4437,THE LANDLORD,exempted from taxation and military duty.
4438,THE LANDLORD,
4439,THE LANDLORD,Talking with our host is next best and instructive to talking with
4440,THE LANDLORD,"one's self. It is a more conscious soliloquy; as it were, to speak"
4441,THE LANDLORD,"generally, and try what we would say provided we had an audience. He"
4442,THE LANDLORD,"has indulgent and open ears, and does not require petty and particular"
4443,THE LANDLORD,"statements. ""Heigh-ho!"" exclaims the traveler. Them's my sentiments,"
4444,THE LANDLORD,"thinks mine host, and stands ready for what may come next, expressing"
4445,THE LANDLORD,"the purest sympathy by his demeanor. ""Hot as blazes!"" says the other."
4446,THE LANDLORD,"""Hard weather, sir,--not much stirring nowadays,"" says he. He is wiser"
4447,THE LANDLORD,than to contradict his guest in any case; he lets him go on; he lets
4448,THE LANDLORD,him travel.
4449,THE LANDLORD,
4450,THE LANDLORD,"The latest sitter leaves him standing far in the night, prepared to"
4451,THE LANDLORD,"live right on, while suns rise and set, and his ""good-night"" has as"
4452,THE LANDLORD,"brisk a sound as his ""good-morning;"" and the earliest riser finds him"
4453,THE LANDLORD,"tasting his liquors in the bar ere flies begin to buzz, with a"
4454,THE LANDLORD,"countenance fresh as the morning star over the sanded floor,--and not"
4455,THE LANDLORD,"as one who had watched all night for travelers. And yet, if beds be"
4456,THE LANDLORD,"the subject of conversation, it will appear that no man has been a"
4457,THE LANDLORD,sounder sleeper in his time.
4458,THE LANDLORD,
4459,THE LANDLORD,"Finally, as for his moral character, we do not hesitate to say that he"
4460,THE LANDLORD,"has no grain of vice or meanness in him, but represents just that"
4461,THE LANDLORD,degree of virtue which all men relish without being obliged to
4462,THE LANDLORD,"respect. He is a good man, as his bitters are good,--an unquestionable"
4463,THE LANDLORD,"goodness. Not what is called a good man,--good to be considered, as a"
4464,THE LANDLORD,"work of art in galleries and museums,--but a good fellow, that is,"
4465,THE LANDLORD,good to be associated with. Who ever thought of the religion of an
4466,THE LANDLORD,"innkeeper,--whether he was joined to the Church, partook of the"
4467,THE LANDLORD,"sacrament, said his prayers, feared God, or the like? No doubt he has"
4468,THE LANDLORD,"had his experiences, has felt a change, and is a firm believer in the"
4469,THE LANDLORD,"perseverance of the saints. In this last, we suspect, does the"
4470,THE LANDLORD,"peculiarity of his religion consist. But he keeps an inn, and not a"
4471,THE LANDLORD,conscience. How many fragrant charities and sincere social virtues are
4472,THE LANDLORD,implied in this daily offering of himself to the public! He cherishes
4473,THE LANDLORD,"good-will to all, and gives the wayfarer as good and honest advice to"
4474,THE LANDLORD,direct him on his road as the priest.
4475,THE LANDLORD,
4476,THE LANDLORD,"To conclude, the tavern will compare favorably with the church. The"
4477,THE LANDLORD,"church is the place where prayers and sermons are delivered, but the"
4478,THE LANDLORD,"tavern is where they are to take effect, and if the former are good,"
4479,THE LANDLORD,the latter cannot be bad.
4480,THE LANDLORD,
4481,THE LANDLORD,
4482,THE LANDLORD,
4483,THE LANDLORD,
4484,A WINTER WALK,A WINTER WALK
4485,A WINTER WALK,
4486,A WINTER WALK,
4487,A WINTER WALK,"The wind has gently murmured through the blinds, or puffed with"
4488,A WINTER WALK,"feathery softness against the windows, and occasionally sighed like a"
4489,A WINTER WALK,"summer zephyr lifting the leaves along, the livelong night. The meadow"
4490,A WINTER WALK,"mouse has slept in his snug gallery in the sod, the owl has sat in a"
4491,A WINTER WALK,"hollow tree in the depth of the swamp, the rabbit, the squirrel, and"
4492,A WINTER WALK,the fox have all been housed. The watch-dog has lain quiet on the
4493,A WINTER WALK,"hearth, and the cattle have stood silent in their stalls. The earth"
4494,A WINTER WALK,"itself has slept, as it were its first, not its last sleep, save when"
4495,A WINTER WALK,some street-sign or wood-house door has faintly creaked upon its
4496,A WINTER WALK,"hinge, cheering forlorn nature at her midnight work,--the only sound"
4497,A WINTER WALK,"awake 'twixt Venus and Mars,--advertising us of a remote inward"
4498,A WINTER WALK,"warmth, a divine cheer and fellowship, where gods are met together,"
4499,A WINTER WALK,but where it is very bleak for men to stand. But while the earth has
4500,A WINTER WALK,"slumbered, all the air has been alive with feathery flakes descending,"
4501,A WINTER WALK,"as if some northern Ceres reigned, showering her silvery grain over"
4502,A WINTER WALK,all the fields.
4503,A WINTER WALK,
4504,A WINTER WALK,"We sleep, and at length awake to the still reality of a winter"
4505,A WINTER WALK,morning. The snow lies warm as cotton or down upon the window-sill;
4506,A WINTER WALK,"the broadened sash and frosted panes admit a dim and private light,"
4507,A WINTER WALK,which enhances the snug cheer within. The stillness of the morning is
4508,A WINTER WALK,impressive. The floor creaks under our feet as we move toward the
4509,A WINTER WALK,window to look abroad through some clear space over the fields. We
4510,A WINTER WALK,see the roofs stand under their snow burden. From the eaves and fences
4511,A WINTER WALK,"hang stalactites of snow, and in the yard stand stalagmites covering"
4512,A WINTER WALK,some concealed core. The trees and shrubs rear white arms to the sky
4513,A WINTER WALK,"on every side; and where were walls and fences, we see fantastic forms"
4514,A WINTER WALK,"stretching in frolic gambols across the dusky landscape, as if Nature"
4515,A WINTER WALK,had strewn her fresh designs over the fields by night as models for
4516,A WINTER WALK,man's art.
4517,A WINTER WALK,
4518,A WINTER WALK,"Silently we unlatch the door, letting the drift fall in, and step"
4519,A WINTER WALK,abroad to face the cutting air. Already the stars have lost some of
4520,A WINTER WALK,"their sparkle, and a dull, leaden mist skirts the horizon. A lurid"
4521,A WINTER WALK,"brazen light in the east proclaims the approach of day, while the"
4522,A WINTER WALK,"western landscape is dim and spectral still, and clothed in a sombre"
4523,A WINTER WALK,"Tartarean light, like the shadowy realms. They are Infernal sounds"
4524,A WINTER WALK,"only that you hear,--the crowing of cocks, the barking of dogs, the"
4525,A WINTER WALK,"chopping of wood, the lowing of kine, all seem to come from Pluto's"
4526,A WINTER WALK,"barnyard and beyond the Styx,--not for any melancholy they suggest,"
4527,A WINTER WALK,but their twilight bustle is too solemn and mysterious for earth. The
4528,A WINTER WALK,"recent tracks of the fox or otter, in the yard, remind us that each"
4529,A WINTER WALK,"hour of the night is crowded with events, and the primeval nature is"
4530,A WINTER WALK,"still working and making tracks in the snow. Opening the gate, we"
4531,A WINTER WALK,"tread briskly along the lone country road, crunching the dry and"
4532,A WINTER WALK,"crisped snow under our feet, or aroused by the sharp, clear creak of"
4533,A WINTER WALK,"the wood-sled, just starting for the distant market, from the early"
4534,A WINTER WALK,"farmer's door, where it has lain the summer long, dreaming amid the"
4535,A WINTER WALK,chips and stubble; while far through the drifts and powdered windows
4536,A WINTER WALK,"we see the farmer's early candle, like a paled star, emitting a lonely"
4537,A WINTER WALK,"beam, as if some severe virtue were at its matins there. And one by"
4538,A WINTER WALK,one the smokes begin to ascend from the chimneys amid the trees and
4539,A WINTER WALK,snows.
4540,A WINTER WALK,
4541,A WINTER WALK,"The sluggish smoke curls up from some deep dell,"
4542,A WINTER WALK,"The stiffened air exploring in the dawn,"
4543,A WINTER WALK,And making slow acquaintance with the day
4544,A WINTER WALK,"Delaying now upon its heavenward course,"
4545,A WINTER WALK,"In wreathèd loiterings dallying with itself,"
4546,A WINTER WALK,With as uncertain purpose and slow deed
4547,A WINTER WALK,"As its half-wakened master by the hearth,"
4548,A WINTER WALK,Whose mind still slumbering and sluggish thoughts
4549,A WINTER WALK,Have not yet swept into the onward current
4550,A WINTER WALK,"Of the new day;--and now it streams afar,"
4551,A WINTER WALK,"The while the chopper goes with step direct,"
4552,A WINTER WALK,And mind intent to swing the early axe.
4553,A WINTER WALK,First in the dusky dawn he sends abroad
4554,A WINTER WALK,"His early scout, his emissary, smoke,"
4555,A WINTER WALK,"The earliest, latest pilgrim from the roof,"
4556,A WINTER WALK,"To feel the frosty air, inform the day;"
4557,A WINTER WALK,"And while he crouches still beside the hearth,"
4558,A WINTER WALK,"Nor musters courage to unbar the door,"
4559,A WINTER WALK,"It has gone down the glen with the light wind,"
4560,A WINTER WALK,"And o'er the plain unfurled its venturous wreath,"
4561,A WINTER WALK,"Draped the tree-tops, loitered upon the hill,"
4562,A WINTER WALK,And warmed the pinions of the early bird;
4563,A WINTER WALK,"And now, perchance, high in the crispy air,"
4564,A WINTER WALK,"Has caught sight of the day o'er the earth's edge,"
4565,A WINTER WALK,"And greets its master's eye at his low door,"
4566,A WINTER WALK,As some refulgent cloud in the upper sky.
4567,A WINTER WALK,
4568,A WINTER WALK,"We hear the sound of wood-chopping at the farmers' doors, far over the"
4569,A WINTER WALK,"frozen earth, the baying of the house-dog, and the distant clarion of"
4570,A WINTER WALK,"the cock,--though the thin and frosty air conveys only the finer"
4571,A WINTER WALK,"particles of sound to our ears, with short and sweet vibrations, as"
4572,A WINTER WALK,"the waves subside soonest on the purest and lightest liquids, in which"
4573,A WINTER WALK,"gross substances sink to the bottom. They come clear and bell-like,"
4574,A WINTER WALK,"and from a greater distance in the horizon, as if there were fewer"
4575,A WINTER WALK,impediments than in summer to make them faint and ragged. The ground
4576,A WINTER WALK,"is sonorous, like seasoned wood, and even the ordinary rural sounds"
4577,A WINTER WALK,"are melodious, and the jingling of the ice on the trees is sweet and"
4578,A WINTER WALK,"liquid. There is the least possible moisture in the atmosphere, all"
4579,A WINTER WALK,"being dried up or congealed, and it is of such extreme tenuity and"
4580,A WINTER WALK,elasticity that it becomes a source of delight. The withdrawn and
4581,A WINTER WALK,"tense sky seems groined like the aisles of a cathedral, and the"
4582,A WINTER WALK,polished air sparkles as if there were crystals of ice floating in it.
4583,A WINTER WALK,As they who have resided in Greenland tell us that when it freezes
4584,A WINTER WALK,"""the sea smokes like burning turf-land, and a fog or mist arises,"
4585,A WINTER WALK,"called frost-smoke,"" which ""cutting smoke frequently raises blisters"
4586,A WINTER WALK,"on the face and hands, and is very pernicious to the health."" But this"
4587,A WINTER WALK,"pure, stinging cold is an elixir to the lungs, and not so much a"
4588,A WINTER WALK,"frozen mist as a crystallized midsummer haze, refined and purified by"
4589,A WINTER WALK,cold.
4590,A WINTER WALK,
4591,A WINTER WALK,"The sun at length rises through the distant woods, as if with the"
4592,A WINTER WALK,"faint clashing, swinging sound of cymbals, melting the air with his"
4593,A WINTER WALK,"beams, and with such rapid steps the morning travels, that already his"
4594,A WINTER WALK,rays are gilding the distant western mountains. Meanwhile we step
4595,A WINTER WALK,"hastily along through the powdery snow, warmed by an inward heat,"
4596,A WINTER WALK,"enjoying an Indian summer still, in the increased glow of thought and"
4597,A WINTER WALK,"feeling. Probably if our lives were more conformed to nature, we"
4598,A WINTER WALK,"should not need to defend ourselves against her heats and colds, but"
4599,A WINTER WALK,"find her our constant nurse and friend, as do plants and quadrupeds."
4600,A WINTER WALK,"If our bodies were fed with pure and simple elements, and not with a"
4601,A WINTER WALK,"stimulating and heating diet, they would afford no more pasture for"
4602,A WINTER WALK,"cold than a leafless twig, but thrive like the trees, which find even"
4603,A WINTER WALK,winter genial to their expansion.
4604,A WINTER WALK,
4605,A WINTER WALK,The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact.
4606,A WINTER WALK,"Every decayed stump and moss-grown stone and rail, and the dead leaves"
4607,A WINTER WALK,"of autumn, are concealed by a clean napkin of snow. In the bare fields"
4608,A WINTER WALK,"and tinkling woods, see what virtue survives. In the coldest and"
4609,A WINTER WALK,"bleakest places, the warmest charities still maintain a foothold. A"
4610,A WINTER WALK,"cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can"
4611,A WINTER WALK,"withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we"
4612,A WINTER WALK,"meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we"
4613,A WINTER WALK,"respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All"
4614,A WINTER WALK,"things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out"
4615,A WINTER WALK,"must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor"
4616,A WINTER WALK,as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air. Its
4617,A WINTER WALK,"greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain"
4618,A WINTER WALK,"stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as"
4619,A WINTER WALK,"through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter,--as if we hoped"
4620,A WINTER WALK,"so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in"
4621,A WINTER WALK,all seasons.
4622,A WINTER WALK,
4623,A WINTER WALK,There is a slumbering subterranean fire in nature which never goes
4624,A WINTER WALK,"out, and which no cold can chill. It finally melts the great snow,"
4625,A WINTER WALK,and in January or July is only buried under a thicker or thinner
4626,A WINTER WALK,"covering. In the coldest day it flows somewhere, and the snow melts"
4627,A WINTER WALK,"around every tree. This field of winter rye, which sprouted late in"
4628,A WINTER WALK,"the fall, and now speedily dissolves the snow, is where the fire is"
4629,A WINTER WALK,"very thinly covered. We feel warmed by it. In the winter, warmth"
4630,A WINTER WALK,"stands for all virtue, and we resort in thought to a trickling rill,"
4631,A WINTER WALK,"with its bare stones shining in the sun, and to warm springs in the"
4632,A WINTER WALK,"woods, with as much eagerness as rabbits and robins. The steam which"
4633,A WINTER WALK,rises from swamps and pools is as dear and domestic as that of our own
4634,A WINTER WALK,"kettle. What fire could ever equal the sunshine of a winter's day,"
4635,A WINTER WALK,"when the meadow mice come out by the wall-sides, and the chickadee"
4636,A WINTER WALK,lisps in the defiles of the wood? The warmth comes directly from the
4637,A WINTER WALK,"sun, and is not radiated from the earth, as in summer; and when we"
4638,A WINTER WALK,"feel his beams on our backs as we are treading some snowy dell, we are"
4639,A WINTER WALK,"grateful as for a special kindness, and bless the sun which has"
4640,A WINTER WALK,followed us into that by-place.
4641,A WINTER WALK,
4642,A WINTER WALK,This subterranean fire has its altar in each man's breast; for in the
4643,A WINTER WALK,"coldest day, and on the bleakest hill, the traveler cherishes a warmer"
4644,A WINTER WALK,fire within the folds of his cloak than is kindled on any hearth. A
4645,A WINTER WALK,"healthy man, indeed, is the complement of the seasons, and in winter,"
4646,A WINTER WALK,summer is in his heart. There is the south. Thither have all birds and
4647,A WINTER WALK,"insects migrated, and around the warm springs in his breast are"
4648,A WINTER WALK,gathered the robin and the lark.
4649,A WINTER WALK,
4650,A WINTER WALK,"At length, having reached the edge of the woods, and shut out the"
4651,A WINTER WALK,"gadding town, we enter within their covert as we go under the roof of"
4652,A WINTER WALK,"a cottage, and cross its threshold, all ceiled and banked up with"
4653,A WINTER WALK,"snow. They are glad and warm still, and as genial and cheery in winter"
4654,A WINTER WALK,as in summer. As we stand in the midst of the pines in the flickering
4655,A WINTER WALK,"and checkered light which straggles but little way into their maze, we"
4656,A WINTER WALK,wonder if the towns have ever heard their simple story. It seems to us
4657,A WINTER WALK,"that no traveler has ever explored them, and notwithstanding the"
4658,A WINTER WALK,"wonders which science is elsewhere revealing every day, who would not"
4659,A WINTER WALK,like to hear their annals? Our humble villages in the plain are their
4660,A WINTER WALK,contribution. We borrow from the forest the boards which shelter and
4661,A WINTER WALK,the sticks which warm us. How important is their evergreen to the
4662,A WINTER WALK,"winter, that portion of the summer which does not fade, the permanent"
4663,A WINTER WALK,"year, the unwithered grass! Thus simply, and with little expense of"
4664,A WINTER WALK,"altitude, is the surface of the earth diversified. What would human"
4665,A WINTER WALK,"life be without forests, those natural cities? From the tops of"
4666,A WINTER WALK,"mountains they appear like smooth-shaven lawns, yet whither shall we"
4667,A WINTER WALK,walk but in this taller grass?
4668,A WINTER WALK,
4669,A WINTER WALK,"In this glade covered with bushes of a year's growth, see how the"
4670,A WINTER WALK,"silvery dust lies on every seared leaf and twig, deposited in such"
4671,A WINTER WALK,infinite and luxurious forms as by their very variety atone for the
4672,A WINTER WALK,"absence of color. Observe the tiny tracks of mice around every stem,"
4673,A WINTER WALK,and the triangular tracks of the rabbit. A pure elastic heaven hangs
4674,A WINTER WALK,"over all, as if the impurities of the summer sky, refined and shrunk"
4675,A WINTER WALK,"by the chaste winter's cold, had been winnowed from the heavens upon"
4676,A WINTER WALK,the earth.
4677,A WINTER WALK,
4678,A WINTER WALK,Nature confounds her summer distinctions at this season. The heavens
4679,A WINTER WALK,seem to be nearer the earth. The elements are less reserved and
4680,A WINTER WALK,"distinct. Water turns to ice, rain to snow. The day is but a"
4681,A WINTER WALK,Scandinavian night. The winter is an arctic summer.
4682,A WINTER WALK,
4683,A WINTER WALK,"How much more living is the life that is in nature, the furred life"
4684,A WINTER WALK,"which still survives the stinging nights, and, from amidst fields and"
4685,A WINTER WALK,"woods covered with frost and snow, sees the sun rise!"
4686,A WINTER WALK,
4687,A WINTER WALK,"""The foodless wilds"
4688,A WINTER WALK,"Pour forth their brown inhabitants."""
4689,A WINTER WALK,
4690,A WINTER WALK,The gray squirrel and rabbit are brisk and playful in the remote
4691,A WINTER WALK,"glens, even on the morning of the cold Friday. Here is our Lapland and"
4692,A WINTER WALK,"Labrador, and for our Esquimaux and Knistenaux, Dog-ribbed Indians,"
4693,A WINTER WALK,"Novazemblaites, and Spitzbergeners, are there not the ice-cutter and"
4694,A WINTER WALK,"woodchopper, the fox, muskrat, and mink?"
4695,A WINTER WALK,
4696,A WINTER WALK,"Still, in the midst of the arctic day, we may trace the summer to its"
4697,A WINTER WALK,"retreats, and sympathize with some contemporary life. Stretched over"
4698,A WINTER WALK,"the brooks, in the midst of the frost-bound meadows, we may observe"
4699,A WINTER WALK,"the submarine cottages of the caddis-worms, the larvæ of the"
4700,A WINTER WALK,"Plicipennes; their small cylindrical cases built around themselves,"
4701,A WINTER WALK,"composed of flags, sticks, grass, and withered leaves, shells, and"
4702,A WINTER WALK,"pebbles, in form and color like the wrecks which strew the"
4703,A WINTER WALK,"bottom,--now drifting along over the pebbly bottom, now whirling in"
4704,A WINTER WALK,"tiny eddies and dashing down steep falls, or sweeping rapidly along"
4705,A WINTER WALK,"with the current, or else swaying to and fro at the end of some"
4706,A WINTER WALK,"grass-blade or root. Anon they will leave their sunken habitations,"
4707,A WINTER WALK,"and, crawling up the stems of plants, or to the surface, like gnats,"
4708,A WINTER WALK,"as perfect insects henceforth, flutter over the surface of the water,"
4709,A WINTER WALK,or sacrifice their short lives in the flame of our candles at evening.
4710,A WINTER WALK,"Down yonder little glen the shrubs are drooping under their burden,"
4711,A WINTER WALK,and the red alderberries contrast with the white ground. Here are the
4712,A WINTER WALK,marks of a myriad feet which have already been abroad. The sun rises
4713,A WINTER WALK,as proudly over such a glen as over the valley of the Seine or the
4714,A WINTER WALK,"Tiber, and it seems the residence of a pure and self-subsistent valor,"
4715,A WINTER WALK,"such as they never witnessed,--which never knew defeat nor fear. Here"
4716,A WINTER WALK,"reign the simplicity and purity of a primitive age, and a health and"
4717,A WINTER WALK,"hope far remote from towns and cities. Standing quite alone, far in"
4718,A WINTER WALK,"the forest, while the wind is shaking down snow from the trees, and"
4719,A WINTER WALK,"leaving the only human tracks behind us, we find our reflections of a"
4720,A WINTER WALK,richer variety than the life of cities. The chickadee and nuthatch are
4721,A WINTER WALK,"more inspiring society than statesmen and philosophers, and we shall"
4722,A WINTER WALK,return to these last as to more vulgar companions. In this lonely
4723,A WINTER WALK,"glen, with its brook draining the slopes, its creased ice and crystals"
4724,A WINTER WALK,"of all hues, where the spruces and hemlocks stand up on either side,"
4725,A WINTER WALK,"and the rush and sere wild oats in the rivulet itself, our lives are"
4726,A WINTER WALK,more serene and worthy to contemplate.
4727,A WINTER WALK,
4728,A WINTER WALK,"As the day advances, the heat of the sun is reflected by the"
4729,A WINTER WALK,"hillsides, and we hear a faint but sweet music, where flows the rill"
4730,A WINTER WALK,"released from its fetters, and the icicles are melting on the trees;"
4731,A WINTER WALK,and the nuthatch and partridge are heard and seen. The south wind
4732,A WINTER WALK,"melts the snow at noon, and the bare ground appears with its withered"
4733,A WINTER WALK,"grass and leaves, and we are invigorated by the perfume which exhales"
4734,A WINTER WALK,"from it, as by the scent of strong meats."
4735,A WINTER WALK,
4736,A WINTER WALK,"Let us go into this deserted woodman's hut, and see how he has passed"
4737,A WINTER WALK,the long winter nights and the short and stormy days. For here man has
4738,A WINTER WALK,"lived under this south hillside, and it seems a civilized and public"
4739,A WINTER WALK,spot. We have such associations as when the traveler stands by the
4740,A WINTER WALK,ruins of Palmyra or Hecatompolis. Singing birds and flowers perchance
4741,A WINTER WALK,"have begun to appear here, for flowers as well as weeds follow in the"
4742,A WINTER WALK,"footsteps of man. These hemlocks whispered over his head, these"
4743,A WINTER WALK,"hickory logs were his fuel, and these pitch pine roots kindled his"
4744,A WINTER WALK,"fire; yonder fuming rill in the hollow, whose thin and airy vapor"
4745,A WINTER WALK,"still ascends as busily as ever, though he is far off now, was his"
4746,A WINTER WALK,"well. These hemlock boughs, and the straw upon this raised platform,"
4747,A WINTER WALK,"were his bed, and this broken dish held his drink. But he has not been"
4748,A WINTER WALK,"here this season, for the phoebes built their nest upon this shelf"
4749,A WINTER WALK,"last summer. I find some embers left as if he had but just gone out,"
4750,A WINTER WALK,where he baked his pot of beans; and while at evening he smoked his
4751,A WINTER WALK,"pipe, whose stemless bowl lies in the ashes, chatted with his only"
4752,A WINTER WALK,"companion, if perchance he had any, about the depth of the snow on the"
4753,A WINTER WALK,"morrow, already falling fast and thick without, or disputed whether"
4754,A WINTER WALK,"the last sound was the screech of an owl, or the creak of a bough, or"
4755,A WINTER WALK,"imagination only; and through his broad chimney-throat, in the late"
4756,A WINTER WALK,"winter evening, ere he stretched himself upon the straw, he looked up"
4757,A WINTER WALK,"to learn the progress of the storm, and, seeing the bright stars of"
4758,A WINTER WALK,"Cassiopeia's Chair shining brightly down upon him, fell contentedly"
4759,A WINTER WALK,asleep.
4760,A WINTER WALK,
4761,A WINTER WALK,See how many traces from which we may learn the chopper's history!
4762,A WINTER WALK,"From this stump we may guess the sharpness of his axe, and from the"
4763,A WINTER WALK,"slope of the stroke, on which side he stood, and whether he cut down"
4764,A WINTER WALK,"the tree without going round it or changing hands; and, from the"
4765,A WINTER WALK,"flexure of the splinters, we may know which way it fell. This one chip"
4766,A WINTER WALK,contains inscribed on it the whole history of the woodchopper and of
4767,A WINTER WALK,"the world. On this scrap of paper, which held his sugar or salt,"
4768,A WINTER WALK,"perchance, or was the wadding of his gun, sitting on a log in the"
4769,A WINTER WALK,"forest, with what interest we read the tattle of cities, of those"
4770,A WINTER WALK,"larger huts, empty and to let, like this, in High Streets and"
4771,A WINTER WALK,Broadways. The eaves are dripping on the south side of this simple
4772,A WINTER WALK,"roof, while the titmouse lisps in the pine and the genial warmth of"
4773,A WINTER WALK,the sun around the door is somewhat kind and human.
4774,A WINTER WALK,
4775,A WINTER WALK,"After two seasons, this rude dwelling does not deform the scene."
4776,A WINTER WALK,"Already the birds resort to it, to build their nests, and you may"
4777,A WINTER WALK,"track to its door the feet of many quadrupeds. Thus, for a long time,"
4778,A WINTER WALK,nature overlooks the encroachment and profanity of man. The wood still
4779,A WINTER WALK,cheerfully and unsuspiciously echoes the strokes of the axe that fells
4780,A WINTER WALK,"it, and while they are few and seldom, they enhance its wildness, and"
4781,A WINTER WALK,all the elements strive to naturalize the sound.
4782,A WINTER WALK,
4783,A WINTER WALK,"Now our path begins to ascend gradually to the top of this high hill,"
4784,A WINTER WALK,from whose precipitous south side we can look over the broad country
4785,A WINTER WALK,"of forest and field and river, to the distant snowy mountains. See"
4786,A WINTER WALK,yonder thin column of smoke curling up through the woods from some
4787,A WINTER WALK,"invisible farmhouse, the standard raised over some rural homestead."
4788,A WINTER WALK,"There must be a warmer and more genial spot there below, as where we"
4789,A WINTER WALK,detect the vapor from a spring forming a cloud above the trees. What
4790,A WINTER WALK,fine relations are established between the traveler who discovers this
4791,A WINTER WALK,airy column from some eminence in the forest and him who sits below!
4792,A WINTER WALK,Up goes the smoke as silently and naturally as the vapor exhales from
4793,A WINTER WALK,"the leaves, and as busy disposing itself in wreaths as the housewife"
4794,A WINTER WALK,"on the hearth below. It is a hieroglyphic of man's life, and suggests"
4795,A WINTER WALK,more intimate and important things than the boiling of a pot. Where
4796,A WINTER WALK,"its fine column rises above the forest, like an ensign, some human"
4797,A WINTER WALK,"life has planted itself,--and such is the beginning of Rome, the"
4798,A WINTER WALK,"establishment of the arts, and the foundation of empires, whether on"
4799,A WINTER WALK,the prairies of America or the steppes of Asia.
4800,A WINTER WALK,
4801,A WINTER WALK,"And now we descend again, to the brink of this woodland lake, which"
4802,A WINTER WALK,"lies in a hollow of the hills, as if it were their expressed juice,"
4803,A WINTER WALK,and that of the leaves which are annually steeped in it. Without
4804,A WINTER WALK,"outlet or inlet to the eye, it has still its history, in the lapse of"
4805,A WINTER WALK,"its waves, in the rounded pebbles on its shore, and in the pines which"
4806,A WINTER WALK,"grow down to its brink. It has not been idle, though sedentary, but,"
4807,A WINTER WALK,"like Abu Musa, teaches that ""sitting still at home is the heavenly"
4808,A WINTER WALK,"way; the going out is the way of the world."" Yet in its evaporation it"
4809,A WINTER WALK,"travels as far as any. In summer it is the earth's liquid eye, a"
4810,A WINTER WALK,mirror in the breast of nature. The sins of the wood are washed out
4811,A WINTER WALK,"in it. See how the woods form an amphitheatre about it, and it is an"
4812,A WINTER WALK,arena for all the genialness of nature. All trees direct the traveler
4813,A WINTER WALK,"to its brink, all paths seek it out, birds fly to it, quadrupeds flee"
4814,A WINTER WALK,"to it, and the very ground inclines toward it. It is nature's saloon,"
4815,A WINTER WALK,where she has sat down to her toilet. Consider her silent economy and
4816,A WINTER WALK,tidiness; how the sun comes with his evaporation to sweep the dust
4817,A WINTER WALK,"from its surface each morning, and a fresh surface is constantly"
4818,A WINTER WALK,"welling up; and annually, after whatever impurities have accumulated"
4819,A WINTER WALK,"herein, its liquid transparency appears again in the spring. In summer"
4820,A WINTER WALK,a hushed music seems to sweep across its surface. But now a plain
4821,A WINTER WALK,"sheet of snow conceals it from our eyes, except where the wind has"
4822,A WINTER WALK,"swept the ice bare, and the sere leaves are gliding from side to side,"
4823,A WINTER WALK,tacking and veering on their tiny voyages. Here is one just keeled up
4824,A WINTER WALK,"against a pebble on shore, a dry beech leaf, rocking still, as if it"
4825,A WINTER WALK,"would start again. A skillful engineer, methinks, might project its"
4826,A WINTER WALK,course since it fell from the parent stem. Here are all the elements
4827,A WINTER WALK,"for such a calculation. Its present position, the direction of the"
4828,A WINTER WALK,"wind, the level of the pond, and how much more is given. In its"
4829,A WINTER WALK,scarred edges and veins is its log rolled up.
4830,A WINTER WALK,
4831,A WINTER WALK,We fancy ourselves in the interior of a larger house. The surface of
4832,A WINTER WALK,"the pond is our deal table or sanded floor, and the woods rise"
4833,A WINTER WALK,"abruptly from its edge, like the walls of a cottage. The lines set to"
4834,A WINTER WALK,catch pickerel through the ice look like a larger culinary
4835,A WINTER WALK,"preparation, and the men stand about on the white ground like pieces"
4836,A WINTER WALK,"of forest furniture. The actions of these men, at the distance of"
4837,A WINTER WALK,"half a mile over the ice and snow, impress us as when we read the"
4838,A WINTER WALK,exploits of Alexander in history. They seem not unworthy of the
4839,A WINTER WALK,"scenery, and as momentous as the conquest of kingdoms."
4840,A WINTER WALK,
4841,A WINTER WALK,"Again we have wandered through the arches of the wood, until from its"
4842,A WINTER WALK,skirts we hear the distant booming of ice from yonder bay of the
4843,A WINTER WALK,"river, as if it were moved by some other and subtler tide than oceans"
4844,A WINTER WALK,"know. To me it has a strange sound of home, thrilling as the voice of"
4845,A WINTER WALK,one's distant and noble kindred. A mild summer sun shines over forest
4846,A WINTER WALK,"and lake, and though there is but one green leaf for many rods, yet"
4847,A WINTER WALK,nature enjoys a serene health. Every sound is fraught with the same
4848,A WINTER WALK,"mysterious assurance of health, as well now the creaking of the boughs"
4849,A WINTER WALK,"in January, as the soft sough of the wind in July."
4850,A WINTER WALK,
4851,A WINTER WALK,When Winter fringes every bough
4852,A WINTER WALK,"With his fantastic wreath,"
4853,A WINTER WALK,And puts the seal of silence now
4854,A WINTER WALK,Upon the leaves beneath;
4855,A WINTER WALK,
4856,A WINTER WALK,When every stream in its penthouse
4857,A WINTER WALK,"Goes gurgling on its way,"
4858,A WINTER WALK,And in his gallery the mouse
4859,A WINTER WALK,Nibbleth the meadow hay;
4860,A WINTER WALK,
4861,A WINTER WALK,"Methinks the summer still is nigh,"
4862,A WINTER WALK,"And lurketh underneath,"
4863,A WINTER WALK,As that same meadow mouse doth lie
4864,A WINTER WALK,Snug in that last year's heath.
4865,A WINTER WALK,
4866,A WINTER WALK,And if perchance the chickadee
4867,A WINTER WALK,"Lisp a faint note anon,"
4868,A WINTER WALK,"The snow is summer's canopy,"
4869,A WINTER WALK,Which she herself put on.
4870,A WINTER WALK,
4871,A WINTER WALK,"Fair blossoms deck the cheerful trees,"
4872,A WINTER WALK,And dazzling fruits depend;
4873,A WINTER WALK,"The north wind sighs a summer breeze,"
4874,A WINTER WALK,"The nipping frosts to fend,"
4875,A WINTER WALK,
4876,A WINTER WALK,"Bringing glad tidings unto me,"
4877,A WINTER WALK,"The while I stand all ear,"
4878,A WINTER WALK,"Of a serene eternity,"
4879,A WINTER WALK,Which need not winter fear.
4880,A WINTER WALK,
4881,A WINTER WALK,Out on the silent pond straightway
4882,A WINTER WALK,"The restless ice doth crack,"
4883,A WINTER WALK,And pond sprites merry gambols play
4884,A WINTER WALK,Amid the deafening rack.
4885,A WINTER WALK,
4886,A WINTER WALK,"Eager I hasten to the vale,"
4887,A WINTER WALK,"As if I heard brave news,"
4888,A WINTER WALK,"How nature held high festival,"
4889,A WINTER WALK,Which it were hard to lose.
4890,A WINTER WALK,
4891,A WINTER WALK,"I gambol with my neighbor ice,"
4892,A WINTER WALK,"And sympathizing quake,"
4893,A WINTER WALK,As each new crack darts in a trice
4894,A WINTER WALK,Across the gladsome lake.
4895,A WINTER WALK,
4896,A WINTER WALK,"One with the cricket in the ground,"
4897,A WINTER WALK,"And fagot on the hearth,"
4898,A WINTER WALK,Resounds the rare domestic sound
4899,A WINTER WALK,Along the forest path.
4900,A WINTER WALK,
4901,A WINTER WALK,Before night we will take a journey on skates along the course of this
4902,A WINTER WALK,"meandering river, as full of novelty to one who sits by the cottage"
4903,A WINTER WALK,"fire all the winter's day, as if it were over the polar ice, with"
4904,A WINTER WALK,"Captain Parry or Franklin; following the winding of the stream, now"
4905,A WINTER WALK,"flowing amid hills, now spreading out into fair meadows, and forming a"
4906,A WINTER WALK,myriad coves and bays where the pine and hemlock overarch. The river
4907,A WINTER WALK,"flows in the rear of the towns, and we see all things from a new and"
4908,A WINTER WALK,"wilder side. The fields and gardens come down to it with a frankness,"
4909,A WINTER WALK,"and freedom from pretension, which they do not wear on the highway. It"
4910,A WINTER WALK,is the outside and edge of the earth. Our eyes are not offended by
4911,A WINTER WALK,violent contrasts. The last rail of the farmer's fence is some swaying
4912,A WINTER WALK,"willow bough, which still preserves its freshness, and here at length"
4913,A WINTER WALK,"all fences stop, and we no longer cross any road. We may go far up"
4914,A WINTER WALK,"within the country now by the most retired and level road, never"
4915,A WINTER WALK,"climbing a hill, but by broad levels ascending to the upland meadows."
4916,A WINTER WALK,"It is a beautiful illustration of the law of obedience, the flow of a"
4917,A WINTER WALK,"river; the path for a sick man, a highway down which an acorn cup may"
4918,A WINTER WALK,"float secure with its freight. Its slight occasional falls, whose"
4919,A WINTER WALK,"precipices would not diversify the landscape, are celebrated by mist"
4920,A WINTER WALK,"and spray, and attract the traveler from far and near. From the remote"
4921,A WINTER WALK,"interior, its current conducts him by broad and easy steps, or by one"
4922,A WINTER WALK,"gentler inclined plane, to the sea. Thus by an early and constant"
4923,A WINTER WALK,yielding to the inequalities of the ground it secures itself the
4924,A WINTER WALK,easiest passage.
4925,A WINTER WALK,
4926,A WINTER WALK,"No domain of nature is quite closed to man at all times, and now we"
4927,A WINTER WALK,draw near to the empire of the fishes. Our feet glide swiftly over
4928,A WINTER WALK,"unfathomed depths, where in summer our line tempted the pout and"
4929,A WINTER WALK,"perch, and where the stately pickerel lurked in the long corridors"
4930,A WINTER WALK,"formed by the bulrushes. The deep, impenetrable marsh, where the heron"
4931,A WINTER WALK,"waded and bittern squatted, is made pervious to our swift shoes, as if"
4932,A WINTER WALK,a thousand railroads had been made into it. With one impulse we are
4933,A WINTER WALK,"carried to the cabin of the muskrat, that earliest settler, and see"
4934,A WINTER WALK,"him dart away under the transparent ice, like a furred fish, to his"
4935,A WINTER WALK,"hole in the bank; and we glide rapidly over meadows where lately ""the"
4936,A WINTER WALK,"mower whet his scythe,"" through beds of frozen cranberries mixed with"
4937,A WINTER WALK,"meadow-grass. We skate near to where the blackbird, the pewee, and the"
4938,A WINTER WALK,"kingbird hung their nests over the water, and the hornets builded from"
4939,A WINTER WALK,"the maple in the swamp. How many gay warblers, following the sun, have"
4940,A WINTER WALK,radiated from this nest of silver birch and thistle-down! On the
4941,A WINTER WALK,"swamp's outer edge was hung the supermarine village, where no foot"
4942,A WINTER WALK,"penetrated. In this hollow tree the wood duck reared her brood, and"
4943,A WINTER WALK,slid away each day to forage in yonder fen.
4944,A WINTER WALK,
4945,A WINTER WALK,"In winter, nature is a cabinet of curiosities, full of dried"
4946,A WINTER WALK,"specimens, in their natural order and position. The meadows and"
4947,A WINTER WALK,forests are a _hortus siccus_. The leaves and grasses stand perfectly
4948,A WINTER WALK,"pressed by the air without screw or gum, and the birds' nests are not"
4949,A WINTER WALK,"hung on an artificial twig, but where they builded them. We go about"
4950,A WINTER WALK,"dry-shod to inspect the summer's work in the rank swamp, and see what"
4951,A WINTER WALK,"a growth have got the alders, the willows, and the maples; testifying"
4952,A WINTER WALK,"to how many warm suns, and fertilizing dews and showers. See what"
4953,A WINTER WALK,"strides their boughs took in the luxuriant summer,--and anon these"
4954,A WINTER WALK,dormant buds will carry them onward and upward another span into the
4955,A WINTER WALK,heavens.
4956,A WINTER WALK,
4957,A WINTER WALK,"Occasionally we wade through fields of snow, under whose depths the"
4958,A WINTER WALK,"river is lost for many rods, to appear again to the right or left,"
4959,A WINTER WALK,"where we least expected; still holding on its way underneath, with a"
4960,A WINTER WALK,"faint, stertorous, rumbling sound, as if, like the bear and marmot,"
4961,A WINTER WALK,"it too had hibernated, and we had followed its faint summer trail to"
4962,A WINTER WALK,where it earthed itself in snow and ice. At first we should have
4963,A WINTER WALK,"thought that rivers would be empty and dry in midwinter, or else"
4964,A WINTER WALK,frozen solid till the spring thawed them; but their volume is not
4965,A WINTER WALK,"diminished even, for only a superficial cold bridges their surfaces."
4966,A WINTER WALK,The thousand springs which feed the lakes and streams are flowing
4967,A WINTER WALK,"still. The issues of a few surface springs only are closed, and they"
4968,A WINTER WALK,go to swell the deep reservoirs. Nature's wells are below the frost.
4969,A WINTER WALK,"The summer brooks are not filled with snow-water, nor does the mower"
4970,A WINTER WALK,quench his thirst with that alone. The streams are swollen when the
4971,A WINTER WALK,"snow melts in the spring, because nature's work has been delayed, the"
4972,A WINTER WALK,"water being turned into ice and snow, whose particles are less smooth"
4973,A WINTER WALK,"and round, and do not find their level so soon."
4974,A WINTER WALK,
4975,A WINTER WALK,"Far over the ice, between the hemlock woods and snow-clad hills,"
4976,A WINTER WALK,"stands the pickerel-fisher, his lines set in some retired cove, like a"
4977,A WINTER WALK,"Finlander, with his arms thrust into the pouches of his dreadnaught;"
4978,A WINTER WALK,"with dull, snowy, fishy thoughts, himself a finless fish, separated a"
4979,A WINTER WALK,"few inches from his race; dumb, erect, and made to be enveloped in"
4980,A WINTER WALK,"clouds and snows, like the pines on shore. In these wild scenes, men"
4981,A WINTER WALK,"stand about in the scenery, or move deliberately and heavily, having"
4982,A WINTER WALK,sacrificed the sprightliness and vivacity of towns to the dumb
4983,A WINTER WALK,"sobriety of nature. He does not make the scenery less wild, more than"
4984,A WINTER WALK,"the jays and muskrats, but stands there as a part of it, as the"
4985,A WINTER WALK,"natives are represented in the voyages of early navigators, at Nootka"
4986,A WINTER WALK,"Sound, and on the Northwest coast, with their furs about them, before"
4987,A WINTER WALK,they were tempted to loquacity by a scrap of iron. He belongs to the
4988,A WINTER WALK,"natural family of man, and is planted deeper in nature and has more"
4989,A WINTER WALK,"root than the inhabitants of towns. Go to him, ask what luck, and you"
4990,A WINTER WALK,will learn that he too is a worshiper of the unseen. Hear with what
4991,A WINTER WALK,sincere deference and waving gesture in his tone he speaks of the lake
4992,A WINTER WALK,"pickerel, which he has never seen, his primitive and ideal race of"
4993,A WINTER WALK,"pickerel. He is connected with the shore still, as by a fish-line, and"
4994,A WINTER WALK,yet remembers the season when he took fish through the ice on the
4995,A WINTER WALK,"pond, while the peas were up in his garden at home."
4996,A WINTER WALK,
4997,A WINTER WALK,"But now, while we have loitered, the clouds have gathered again, and a"
4998,A WINTER WALK,few straggling snowflakes are beginning to descend. Faster and faster
4999,A WINTER WALK,"they fall, shutting out the distant objects from sight. The snow falls"
5000,A WINTER WALK,"on every wood and field, and no crevice is forgotten; by the river and"
5001,A WINTER WALK,"the pond, on the hill and in the valley. Quadrupeds are confined to"
5002,A WINTER WALK,their coverts and the birds sit upon their perches this peaceful hour.
5003,A WINTER WALK,"There is not so much sound as in fair weather, but silently and"
5004,A WINTER WALK,"gradually every slope, and the gray walls and fences, and the polished"
5005,A WINTER WALK,"ice, and the sere leaves, which were not buried before, are concealed,"
5006,A WINTER WALK,and the tracks of men and beasts are lost. With so little effort does
5007,A WINTER WALK,nature reassert her rule and blot out the traces of men. Hear how
5008,A WINTER WALK,"Homer has described the same: ""The snowflakes fall thick and fast on a"
5009,A WINTER WALK,"winter's day. The winds are lulled, and the snow falls incessant,"
5010,A WINTER WALK,"covering the tops of the mountains, and the hills, and the plains"
5011,A WINTER WALK,"where the lotus-tree grows, and the cultivated fields, and they are"
5012,A WINTER WALK,"falling by the inlets and shores of the foaming sea, but are silently"
5013,A WINTER WALK,"dissolved by the waves."" The snow levels all things, and infolds them"
5014,A WINTER WALK,"deeper in the bosom of nature, as, in the slow summer, vegetation"
5015,A WINTER WALK,"creeps up to the entablature of the temple, and the turrets of the"
5016,A WINTER WALK,"castle, and helps her to prevail over art."
5017,A WINTER WALK,
5018,A WINTER WALK,"The surly night-wind rustles through the wood, and warns us to retrace"
5019,A WINTER WALK,"our steps, while the sun goes down behind the thickening storm, and"
5020,A WINTER WALK,"birds seek their roosts, and cattle their stalls."
5021,A WINTER WALK,
5022,A WINTER WALK,"""Drooping the lab'rer ox"
5023,A WINTER WALK,"Stands covered o'er with snow, and _now_ demands"
5024,A WINTER WALK,"The fruit of all his toil."""
5025,A WINTER WALK,
5026,A WINTER WALK,"Though winter is represented in the almanac as an old man, facing the"
5027,A WINTER WALK,"wind and sleet, and drawing his cloak about him, we rather think of"
5028,A WINTER WALK,"him as a merry woodchopper, and warm-blooded youth, as blithe as"
5029,A WINTER WALK,summer. The unexplored grandeur of the storm keeps up the spirits of
5030,A WINTER WALK,"the traveler. It does not trifle with us, but has a sweet earnestness."
5031,A WINTER WALK,"In winter we lead a more inward life. Our hearts are warm and cheery,"
5032,A WINTER WALK,"like cottages under drifts, whose windows and doors are half"
5033,A WINTER WALK,"concealed, but from whose chimneys the smoke cheerfully ascends. The"
5034,A WINTER WALK,imprisoning drifts increase the sense of comfort which the house
5035,A WINTER WALK,"affords, and in the coldest days we are content to sit over the hearth"
5036,A WINTER WALK,"and see the sky through the chimney-top, enjoying the quiet and serene"
5037,A WINTER WALK,"life that may be had in a warm corner by the chimney-side, or feeling"
5038,A WINTER WALK,"our pulse by listening to the low of cattle in the street, or the"
5039,A WINTER WALK,sound of the flail in distant barns all the long afternoon. No doubt a
5040,A WINTER WALK,skillful physician could determine our health by observing how these
5041,A WINTER WALK,"simple and natural sounds affected us. We enjoy now, not an Oriental,"
5042,A WINTER WALK,"but a Boreal leisure, around warm stoves and fireplaces, and watch the"
5043,A WINTER WALK,shadow of motes in the sunbeams.
5044,A WINTER WALK,
5045,A WINTER WALK,Sometimes our fate grows too homely and familiarly serious ever to be
5046,A WINTER WALK,cruel. Consider how for three months the human destiny is wrapped in
5047,A WINTER WALK,furs. The good Hebrew Revelation takes no cognizance of all this
5048,A WINTER WALK,cheerful snow. Is there no religion for the temperate and frigid
5049,A WINTER WALK,zones? We know of no scripture which records the pure benignity of the
5050,A WINTER WALK,gods on a New England winter night. Their praises have never been
5051,A WINTER WALK,"sung, only their wrath deprecated. The best scripture, after all,"
5052,A WINTER WALK,records but a meagre faith. Its saints live reserved and austere. Let
5053,A WINTER WALK,"a brave, devout man spend the year in the woods of Maine or Labrador,"
5054,A WINTER WALK,and see if the Hebrew Scriptures speak adequately to his condition and
5055,A WINTER WALK,"experience, from the setting in of winter to the breaking up of the"
5056,A WINTER WALK,ice.
5057,A WINTER WALK,
5058,A WINTER WALK,"Now commences the long winter evening around the farmer's hearth, when"
5059,A WINTER WALK,"the thoughts of the indwellers travel far abroad, and men are by"
5060,A WINTER WALK,nature and necessity charitable and liberal to all creatures. Now is
5061,A WINTER WALK,"the happy resistance to cold, when the farmer reaps his reward, and"
5062,A WINTER WALK,"thinks of his preparedness for winter, and, through the glittering"
5063,A WINTER WALK,"panes, sees with equanimity ""the mansion of the northern bear,"" for"
5064,A WINTER WALK,"now the storm is over,--"
5065,A WINTER WALK,
5066,A WINTER WALK,"""The full ethereal round,"
5067,A WINTER WALK,"Infinite worlds disclosing to the view,"
5068,A WINTER WALK,Shines out intensely keen; and all one cope
5069,A WINTER WALK,"Of starry glitter glows from pole to pole."""

5074,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6]
5075,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5076,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5077,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Every man is entitled to come to Cattle-Show, even a"
5078,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],transcendentalist; and for my part I am more interested in the men
5079,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"than in the cattle. I wish to see once more those old familiar faces,"
5080,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"whose names I do not know, which for me represent the Middlesex"
5081,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"country, and come as near being indigenous to the soil as a white man"
5082,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"can; the men who are not above their business, whose coats are not too"
5083,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"black, whose shoes do not shine very much, who never wear gloves to"
5084,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"conceal their hands. It is true, there are some queer specimens of"
5085,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"humanity attracted to our festival, but all are welcome. I am pretty"
5086,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"sure to meet once more that weak-minded and whimsical fellow,"
5087,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"generally weak-bodied too, who prefers a crooked stick for a cane;"
5088,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"perfectly useless, you would say, only _bizarre_, fit for a cabinet,"
5089,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"like a petrified snake. A ram's horn would be as convenient, and is"
5090,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],yet more curiously twisted. He brings that much indulged bit of the
5091,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"country with him, from some town's end or other, and introduces it to"
5092,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Concord groves, as if he had promised it so much sometime. So some, it"
5093,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seems to me, elect their rulers for their crookedness. But I think"
5094,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"that a straight stick makes the best cane, and an upright man the best"
5095,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],ruler. Or why choose a man to do plain work who is distinguished for
5096,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"his oddity? However, I do not know but you will think that they have"
5097,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],committed this mistake who invited me to speak to you to-day.
5098,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5099,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"In my capacity of surveyor, I have often talked with some of you, my"
5100,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"employers, at your dinner-tables, after having gone round and round"
5101,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and behind your farming, and ascertained exactly what its limits were."
5102,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Moreover, taking a surveyor's and a naturalist's liberty, I have been"
5103,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"in the habit of going across your lots much oftener than is usual, as"
5104,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"many of you, perhaps to your sorrow, are aware. Yet many of you, to my"
5105,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"relief, have seemed not to be aware of it; and, when I came across you"
5106,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"in some out-of-the-way nook of your farms, have inquired, with an air"
5107,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of surprise, if I were not lost, since you had never seen me in that"
5108,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"part of the town or county before; when, if the truth were known, and"
5109,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"it had not been for betraying my secret, I might with more propriety"
5110,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"have inquired if _you_ were not lost, since I had never seen _you_"
5111,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],there before. I have several times shown the proprietor the shortest
5112,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],way out of his wood-lot.
5113,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5114,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Therefore, it would seem that I have some title to speak to you"
5115,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to-day; and considering what that title is, and the occasion that has"
5116,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"called us together, I need offer no apology if I invite your"
5117,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"attention, for the few moments that are allotted me, to a purely"
5118,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],scientific subject.
5119,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5120,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"At those dinner-tables referred to, I have often been asked, as many"
5121,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of you have been, if I could tell how it happened, that when a pine"
5122,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"wood was cut down an oak one commonly sprang up, and _vice versa_. To"
5123,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"which I have answered, and now answer, that I can tell,--that it is no"
5124,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],mystery to me. As I am not aware that this has been clearly shown by
5125,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"any one, I shall lay the more stress on this point. Let me lead you"
5126,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],back into your wood-lots again.
5127,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5128,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"When, hereabouts, a single forest tree or a forest springs up"
5129,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"naturally where none of its kind grew before, I do not hesitate to"
5130,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"say, though in some quarters still it may sound paradoxical, that it"
5131,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],came from a seed. Of the various ways by which trees are _known_ to be
5132,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"propagated,--by transplanting, cuttings, and the like,--this is the"
5133,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],only supposable one under these circumstances. No such tree has ever
5134,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],been known to spring from anything else. If any one asserts that it
5135,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"sprang from something else, or from nothing, the burden of proof lies"
5136,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],with him.
5137,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5138,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"It remains, then, only to show how the seed is transported from where"
5139,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],it grows to where it is planted. This is done chiefly by the agency of
5140,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the wind, water, and animals. The lighter seeds, as those of pines and"
5141,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"maples, are transported chiefly by wind and water; the heavier, as"
5142,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"acorns and nuts, by animals."
5143,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5144,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"In all the pines, a very thin membrane, in appearance much like an"
5145,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"insect's wing, grows over and around the seed, and independent of it,"
5146,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],while the latter is being developed within its base. Indeed this is
5147,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"often perfectly developed, though the seed is abortive; nature being,"
5148,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"you would say, more sure to provide the means of transporting the"
5149,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seed, than to provide the seed to be transported. In other words, a"
5150,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"beautiful thin sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to it such"
5151,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"as the wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the wind,"
5152,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],expressly that it may transport the seed and extend the range of the
5153,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"species; and this it does, as effectually as when seeds are sent by"
5154,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],mail in a different kind of sack from the Patent Office. There is a
5155,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"patent office at the seat of government of the universe, whose"
5156,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],managers are as much interested in the dispersion of seeds as anybody
5157,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"at Washington can be, and their operations are infinitely more"
5158,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],extensive and regular.
5159,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5160,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung"
5161,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"up from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in"
5162,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"asserting that they come from seeds, though the mode of their"
5163,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],propagation _by nature_ has been but little attended to. They are very
5164,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"extensively raised from the seed in Europe, and are beginning to be"
5165,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],here.
5166,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5167,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not _at once_ spring"
5168,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"up there unless there are, or have been quite recently, seed-bearing"
5169,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pines near enough for the seeds to be blown from them. But, adjacent"
5170,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to a forest of pines, if you prevent other crops from growing there,"
5171,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"you will surely have an extension of your pine forest, provided the"
5172,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],soil is suitable.
5173,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5174,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"As for the heavy seeds and nuts which are not furnished with wings,"
5175,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the notion is still a very common one that, when the trees which bear"
5176,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"these spring up where none of their kind were noticed before, they"
5177,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],have come from seeds or other principles spontaneously generated there
5178,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"in an unusual manner, or which have lain dormant in the soil for"
5179,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"centuries, or perhaps been called into activity by the heat of a"
5180,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"burning. I do not believe these assertions, and I will state some of"
5181,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the ways in which, according to my observation, such forests are"
5182,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],planted and raised.
5183,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5184,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Every one of these seeds, too, will be found to be winged or legged in"
5185,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],another fashion. Surely it is not wonderful that cherry trees of all
5186,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"kinds are widely dispersed, since their fruit is well known to be the"
5187,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"favorite food of various birds. Many kinds are called bird cherries,"
5188,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and they appropriate many more kinds, which are not so called. Eating"
5189,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"cherries is a bird-like employment, and unless we disperse the seeds"
5190,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"occasionally, as they do, I shall think that the birds have the best"
5191,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],right to them. See how artfully the seed of a cherry is placed in
5192,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"order that a bird may be compelled to transport it,--in the very midst"
5193,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of a tempting pericarp, so that the creature that would devour this"
5194,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],must commonly take the stone also into its mouth or bill. If you ever
5195,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ate a cherry, and did not make two bites of it, you must have"
5196,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"perceived it,--right in the centre of the luscious morsel, a large"
5197,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],earthy residuum left on the tongue. We thus take into our mouths
5198,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"cherry-stones as big as peas, a dozen at once, for Nature can persuade"
5199,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],us to do almost anything when she would compass her ends. Some wild
5200,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"men and children instinctively swallow these, as the birds do when in"
5201,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"a hurry, it being the shortest way to get rid of them. Thus, though"
5202,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"these seeds are not provided with vegetable wings, Nature has impelled"
5203,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],the thrush tribe to take them into their bills and fly away with them;
5204,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and they are winged in another sense, and more effectually than the"
5205,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seeds of pines, for these are carried even against the wind. The"
5206,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"consequence is, that cherry trees grow not only here but there. The"
5207,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],same is true of a great many other seeds.
5208,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5209,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],But to come to the observation which suggested these remarks. As I
5210,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"have said, I suspect that I can throw some light on the fact that when"
5211,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"hereabouts a dense pine wood is cut down, oaks and other hard woods"
5212,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],may at once take its place. I have got only to show that the acorns
5213,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and nuts, provided they are grown in the neighborhood, are regularly"
5214,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],planted in such woods; for I assert that if an oak tree has not grown
5215,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"within ten miles, and man has not carried acorns thither, then an oak"
5216,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"wood will not spring up _at once_, when a pine wood is cut down."
5217,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5218,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Apparently, there were only pines there before. They are cut off, and"
5219,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],after a year or two you see oaks and other hard woods springing up
5220,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"there, with scarcely a pine amid them, and the wonder commonly is, how"
5221,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],the seed could have lain in the ground so long without decaying. But
5222,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the truth is, that it has not lain in the ground so long, but is"
5223,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],regularly planted each year by various quadrupeds and birds.
5224,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5225,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"In this neighborhood, where oaks and pines are about equally"
5226,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"dispersed, if you look through the thickest pine wood, even the"
5227,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seemingly unmixed pitch pine ones, you will commonly detect many"
5228,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"little oaks, birches, and other hard woods, sprung from seeds carried"
5229,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"into the thicket by squirrels and other animals, and also blown"
5230,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"thither, but which are overshadowed and choked by the pines. The"
5231,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"denser the evergreen wood, the more likely it is to be well planted"
5232,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"with these seeds, because the planters incline to resort with their"
5233,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],forage to the closest covert. They also carry it into birch and other
5234,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"woods. This planting is carried on annually, and the oldest seedlings"
5235,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"annually die; but when the pines are cleared off, the oaks, having got"
5236,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"just the start they want, and now secured favorable conditions,"
5237,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],immediately spring up to trees.
5238,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5239,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],The shade of a dense pine wood is more unfavorable to the springing up
5240,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of pines of the same species than of oaks within it, though the former"
5241,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"may come up abundantly when the pines are cut, if there chance to be"
5242,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],sound seed in the ground.
5243,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5244,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"But when you cut off a lot of hard wood, very often the little pines"
5245,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"mixed with it have a similar start, for the squirrels have carried off"
5246,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the nuts to the pines, and not to the more open wood, and they"
5247,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"commonly make pretty clean work of it; and moreover, if the wood was"
5248,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"old, the sprouts will be feeble or entirely fail; to say nothing about"
5249,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the soil being, in a measure, exhausted for this kind of crop."
5250,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5251,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"If a pine wood is surrounded by a white oak one chiefly, white oaks"
5252,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],may be expected to succeed when the pines are cut. If it is surrounded
5253,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"instead by an edging of shrub oaks, then you will probably have a"
5254,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],dense shrub oak thicket.
5255,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5256,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"I have no time to go into details, but will say, in a word, that while"
5257,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],the wind is conveying the seeds of pines into hard woods and open
5258,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"lands, the squirrels and other animals are conveying the seeds of oaks"
5259,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and walnuts into the pine woods, and thus a rotation of crops is kept"
5260,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],up.
5261,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5262,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"I affirmed this confidently many years ago, and an occasional"
5263,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],examination of dense pine woods confirmed me in my opinion. It has
5264,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the ground,"
5265,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],but I am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular
5266,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],succession of forests.
5267,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5268,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"On the 24th of September, in 1857, as I was paddling down the Assabet,"
5269,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"in this town, I saw a red squirrel run along the bank under some"
5270,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"herbage, with something large in its mouth. It stopped near the foot"
5271,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of a hemlock, within a couple of rods of me, and, hastily pawing a"
5272,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"hole with its fore feet, dropped its booty into it, covered it up, and"
5273,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],retreated part way up the trunk of the tree. As I approached the shore
5274,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to examine the deposit, the squirrel, descending part way, betrayed no"
5275,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"little anxiety about its treasure, and made two or three motions to"
5276,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"recover it before it finally retreated. Digging there, I found two"
5277,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"green pignuts joined together, with the thick husks on, buried about"
5278,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],an inch and a half under the reddish soil of decayed hemlock
5279,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"leaves,--just the right depth to plant it. In short, this squirrel was"
5280,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"then engaged in accomplishing two objects, to wit, laying up a store"
5281,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of winter food for itself, and planting a hickory wood for all"
5282,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"creation. If the squirrel was killed, or neglected its deposit, a"
5283,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],hickory would spring up. The nearest hickory tree was twenty rods
5284,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"distant. These nuts were there still just fourteen days later, but"
5285,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"were gone when I looked again, November 21st, or six weeks later"
5286,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],still.
5287,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5288,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"I have since examined more carefully several dense woods, which are"
5289,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"said to be, and are apparently, exclusively pine, and always with the"
5290,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"same result. For instance, I walked the same day to a small but very"
5291,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"dense and handsome white pine grove, about fifteen rods square, in the"
5292,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"east part of this town. The trees are large for Concord, being from"
5293,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ten to twenty inches in diameter, and as exclusively pine as any wood"
5294,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"that I know. Indeed, I selected this wood because I thought it the"
5295,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],least likely to contain anything else. It stands on an open plain or
5296,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pasture, except that it adjoins another small pine wood, which has a"
5297,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"few little oaks in it, on the southeast side. On every other side, it"
5298,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],was at least thirty rods from the nearest woods. Standing on the edge
5299,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of this grove and looking through it, for it is quite level and free"
5300,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"from underwood, for the most part bare, red-carpeted ground, you would"
5301,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"have said that there was not a hardwood tree in it, young or old. But"
5302,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"on looking carefully along over its floor I discovered, though it was"
5303,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"not till my eye had got used to the search, that, alternating with"
5304,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"thin ferns, and small blueberry bushes, there was, not merely here and"
5305,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"there, but as often as every five feet and with a degree of"
5306,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"regularity, a little oak, from three to twelve inches high, and in one"
5307,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],place I found a green acorn dropped by the base of a pine.
5308,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5309,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],I confess I was surprised to find my theory so perfectly proved in
5310,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"this case. One of the principal agents in this planting, the red"
5311,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"squirrels, were all the while curiously inspecting me, while I was"
5312,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],inspecting their plantation. Some of the little oaks had been browsed
5313,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"by cows, which resorted to this wood for shade."
5314,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5315,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"After seven or eight years, the hard woods evidently find such a"
5316,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"locality unfavorable to their growth, the pines being allowed to"
5317,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"stand. As an evidence of this, I observed a diseased red maple"
5318,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"twenty-five feet long, which had been recently prostrated, though it"
5319,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"was still covered with green leaves, the only maple in any position in"
5320,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],the wood.
5321,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5322,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],But although these oaks almost invariably die if the pines are not cut
5323,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"down, it is probable that they do better for a few years under their"
5324,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],shelter than they would anywhere else.
5325,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5326,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],The very extensive and thorough experiments of the English have at
5327,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],length led them to adopt a method of raising oaks almost precisely
5328,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],like this which somewhat earlier had been adopted by Nature and her
5329,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],squirrels here; they have simply rediscovered the value of pines as
5330,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"nurses for oaks. The English experimenters seem, early and generally,"
5331,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],to have found out the importance of using trees of some kind as
5332,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],nurse-plants for the young oaks. I quote from Loudon what he describes
5333,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"as ""the ultimatum on the subject of planting and sheltering"
5334,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"oaks,""--""an abstract of the practice adopted by the government"
5335,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"officers in the national forests"" of England, prepared by Alexander"
5336,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],Milne.
5337,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5338,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"At first some oaks had been planted by themselves, and others mixed"
5339,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"with Scotch pines; ""but in all cases,"" says Mr. Milne, ""where oaks"
5340,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],were planted actually among the pines and surrounded by them [though
5341,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the soil might be inferior], the oaks were found to be much the best."""
5342,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"""For several years past, the plan pursued has been to plant the"
5343,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],inclosures with Scotch pines only [a tree very similar to our pitch
5344,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pine], and when the pines have got to the height of five or six feet,"
5345,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],then to put in good strong oak plants of about four or five years'
5346,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"growth among the pines,--not cutting away any pines at first, unless"
5347,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],they happen to be so strong and thick as to overshadow the oaks. In
5348,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],about two years it becomes necessary to shred the branches of the
5349,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pines, to give light and air to the oaks, and in about two or three"
5350,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"more years to begin gradually to remove the pines altogether, taking"
5351,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"out a certain number each year, so that, at the end of twenty or"
5352,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"twenty-five years, not a single Scotch pine shall be left; although,"
5353,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"for the first ten or twelve years, the plantation may have appeared to"
5354,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],contain nothing else but pine. The advantage of this mode of planting
5355,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"has been found to be that the pines dry and ameliorate the soil,"
5356,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],destroying the coarse grass and brambles which frequently choke and
5357,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"injure oaks; and that no mending over is necessary, as scarcely an oak"
5358,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"so planted is found to fail."""
5359,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5360,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Thus much the English planters have discovered by patient experiment,"
5361,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and, for aught I know, they have taken out a patent for it; but they"
5362,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"appear not to have discovered that it was discovered before, and that"
5363,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"they are merely adopting the method of Nature, which she long ago made"
5364,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],patent to all. She is all the while planting the oaks amid the pines
5365,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"without our knowledge, and at last, instead of government officers, we"
5366,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"send a party of woodchoppers to cut down the pines, and so rescue an"
5367,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"oak forest, at which we wonder as if it had dropped from the skies."
5368,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5369,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the sound of green"
5370,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pignuts falling from time to time, cut off by the chickaree over my"
5371,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"head. In the fall, I notice on the ground, either within or in the"
5372,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"neighborhood of oak woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs"
5373,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"three or four inches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn-cups,"
5374,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"which twigs have been gnawed off by squirrels, on both sides of the"
5375,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"nuts, in order to make them more portable. The jays scream and the red"
5376,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"squirrels scold while you are clubbing and shaking the chestnut trees,"
5377,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"for they are there on the same errand, and two of a trade never agree."
5378,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],I frequently see a red or gray squirrel cast down a green chestnut
5379,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"bur, as I am going through the woods, and I used to think, sometimes,"
5380,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"that they were cast at me. In fact, they are so busy about it, in the"
5381,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"midst of the chestnut season, that you cannot stand long in the woods"
5382,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"without hearing one fall. A sportsman told me that he had, the day"
5383,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"before,--that was in the middle of October,--seen a green chestnut bur"
5384,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"dropped on our great river meadow, fifty rods from the nearest wood,"
5385,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and much further from the nearest chestnut tree, and he could not tell"
5386,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"how it came there. Occasionally, when chestnutting in midwinter, I"
5387,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"find thirty or forty nuts in a pile, left in its gallery, just under"
5388,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the leaves, by the common wood mouse (_Mus leucopus_)."
5389,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5390,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"But especially, in the winter, the extent to which this transportation"
5391,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],and planting of nuts is carried on is made apparent by the snow. In
5392,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"almost every wood, you will see where the red or gray squirrels have"
5393,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pawed down through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet"
5394,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine cone, as directly"
5395,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"as if they had started from it and bored upward,--which you and I"
5396,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],could not have done. It would be difficult for us to find one before
5397,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the snow falls. Commonly, no doubt, they had deposited them there in"
5398,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the fall. You wonder if they remember the localities, or discover them"
5399,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],by the scent. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the
5400,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"earth under a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of"
5401,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],evergreens in the midst of a deciduous wood. If there are any nut
5402,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],trees which still retain their nuts standing at a distance without the
5403,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"wood, their paths often lead directly to and from them. We therefore"
5404,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],need not suppose an oak standing here and there _in_ the wood in order
5405,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to seed it, but if a few stand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it"
5406,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],is sufficient.
5407,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5408,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],I think that I may venture to say that every white pine cone that
5409,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"falls to the earth naturally in this town, before opening and losing"
5410,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"its seeds, and almost every pitch pine one that falls at all, is cut"
5411,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"off by a squirrel, and they begin to pluck them long before they are"
5412,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ripe, so that when the crop of white pine cones is a small one, as it"
5413,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"commonly is, they cut off thus almost every one of these before it"
5414,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"fairly ripens. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so"
5415,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"speak, in cutting them off green, is, partly, to prevent their opening"
5416,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and losing their seeds, for these are the ones for which they dig"
5417,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"through the snow, and the only white pine cones which contain anything"
5418,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"then. I have counted in one heap, within a diameter of four feet, the"
5419,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],cores of 239 pitch pine cones which had been cut off and stripped by
5420,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],the red squirrel the previous winter.
5421,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5422,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just beneath it, are"
5423,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],placed in the most favorable circumstances for germinating. I have
5424,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],sometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the
5425,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"earth got planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of"
5426,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the same year partially mixed with the mould, as it were, under the"
5427,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"decaying and mouldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure"
5428,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"they want, for the nuts fall fast. In a plentiful year, a large"
5429,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"proportion of the nuts are thus covered loosely an inch deep, and are,"
5430,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of course, somewhat concealed from squirrels. One winter, when the"
5431,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a rake, many quarts of"
5432,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"these nuts as late as the tenth of January, and though some bought at"
5433,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the store the same day were more than half of them mouldy, I did not"
5434,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],find a single mouldy one among these which I picked from under the wet
5435,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and mouldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once or twice. Nature"
5436,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],knows how to pack them best. They were still plump and tender.
5437,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Apparently, they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they"
5438,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],were all sprouting.
5439,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5440,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Loudon says that ""when the nut [of the common walnut of Europe] is to"
5441,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],be preserved through the winter for the purpose of planting in the
5442,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"following spring, it should be laid in a rot-heap, as soon as"
5443,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"gathered, with the husk on, and the heap should be turned over"
5444,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"frequently in the course of the winter."""

5446,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Here, again, he is stealing Nature's ""thunder."" How can a poor mortal"
5447,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"do otherwise? for it is she that finds fingers to steal with, and the"
5448,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"treasure to be stolen. In the planting of the seeds of most trees, the"
5449,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"best gardeners do no more than follow Nature, though they may not know"
5450,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"it. Generally, both large and small ones are most sure to germinate,"
5451,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and succeed best, when only beaten into the earth with the back of a"
5452,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"spade, and then covered with leaves or straw. These results to which"
5453,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],planters have arrived remind us of the experience of Kane and his
5454,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"companions at the north, who, when learning to live in that climate,"
5455,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],were surprised to find themselves steadily adopting the customs of the
5456,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"natives, simply becoming Esquimaux. So, when we experiment in planting"
5457,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"forests, we find ourselves at last doing as Nature does. Would it not"
5458,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],be well to consult with Nature in the outset? for she is the most
5459,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"extensive and experienced planter of us all, not excepting the Dukes"
5460,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],of Athol.
5461,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5462,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"In short, they who have not attended particularly to this subject are"
5463,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"but little aware to what an extent quadrupeds and birds are employed,"
5464,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"especially in the fall, in collecting, and so disseminating and"
5465,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"planting, the seeds of trees. It is the almost constant employment of"
5466,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the squirrels at that season, and you rarely meet with one that has"
5467,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"not a nut in its mouth, or is not just going to get one. One"
5468,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],squirrel-hunter of this town told me that he knew of a walnut tree
5469,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"which bore particularly good nuts, but that on going to gather them"
5470,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"one fall, he found that he had been anticipated by a family of a dozen"
5471,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"red squirrels. He took out of the tree, which was hollow, one bushel"
5472,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and three pecks by measurement, without the husks, and they supplied"
5473,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],him and his family for the winter. It would be easy to multiply
5474,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],instances of this kind. How commonly in the fall you see the
5475,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],cheek-pouches of the striped squirrel distended by a quantity of nuts!
5476,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"This species gets its scientific name, _Tamias_, or the steward, from"
5477,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],its habit of storing up nuts and other seeds. Look under a nut tree a
5478,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"month after the nuts have fallen, and see what proportion of sound"
5479,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],nuts to the abortive ones and shells you will find ordinarily. They
5480,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"have been already eaten, or dispersed far and wide. The ground looks"
5481,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"like a platform before a grocery, where the gossips of the village sit"
5482,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to crack nuts and less savory jokes. You have come, you would say,"
5483,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"after the feast was over, and are presented with the shells only."
5484,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5485,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall, you will hear a"
5486,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"sound as if some one had broken a twig, and, looking up, see a jay"
5487,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"pecking at an acorn, or you will see a flock of them at once about it,"
5488,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"in the top of an oak, and hear them break them off. They then fly to a"
5489,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"suitable limb, and placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away at it"
5490,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"busily, making a sound like a woodpecker's tapping, looking round from"
5491,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"time to time to see if any foe is approaching, and soon reach the"
5492,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"meat, and nibble at it, holding up their heads to swallow, while they"
5493,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],hold the remainder very firmly with their claws. Nevertheless it often
5494,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],drops to the ground before the bird has done with it. I can confirm
5495,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"what William Bartram wrote to Wilson, the ornithologist, that ""the jay"
5496,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"is one of the most useful agents in the economy of nature, for"
5497,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],disseminating forest trees and other nuciferous and hard-seeded
5498,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],vegetables on which they feed. Their chief employment during the
5499,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],autumnal season is foraging to supply their winter stores. In
5500,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],performing this necessary duty they drop abundance of seed in their
5501,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"flight over fields, hedges, and by fences, where they alight to"
5502,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"deposit them in the post-holes, etc. It is remarkable what numbers of"
5503,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],young trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet winter and
5504,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"spring. These birds alone are capable, in a few years' time, to"
5505,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"replant all the cleared lands."""
5506,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5507,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop their nuts in open
5508,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"land, which will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which"
5509,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"spring up in pastures, for, depend on it, every new tree comes from a"
5510,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seed. When I examine the little oaks, one or two years old, in such"
5511,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"places, I invariably find the empty acorn from which they sprung."
5512,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5513,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],So far from the seed having lain dormant in the soil since oaks grew
5514,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"there before, as many believe, it is well known that it is difficult"
5515,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],to preserve the vitality of acorns long enough to transport them to
5516,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Europe; and it is recommended in Loudon's ""Arboretum,"" as the safest"
5517,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"course, to sprout them in pots on the voyage. The same authority"
5518,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"states that ""very few acorns of any species will germinate after"
5519,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"having been kept a year,"" that beech mast ""only retains its vital"
5520,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"properties one year,"" and the black walnut ""seldom more than six"
5521,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"months after it has ripened."" I have frequently found that in November"
5522,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],almost every acorn left on the ground had sprouted or decayed. What
5523,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"with frost, drouth, moisture, and worms, the greater part are soon"
5524,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"destroyed. Yet it is stated by one botanical writer that ""acorns that"
5525,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"have lain for centuries, on being ploughed up, have soon vegetated."""
5526,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5527,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Mr. George B. Emerson, in his valuable Report on the Trees and Shrubs"
5528,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"of this State, says of the pines: ""The tenacity of life of the seeds"
5529,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],is remarkable. They will remain for many years unchanged in the
5530,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ground, protected by the coolness and deep shade of the forest above"
5531,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"them. But when the forest is removed, and the warmth of the sun"
5532,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"admitted, they immediately vegetate."" Since he does not tell us on"
5533,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"what observation his remark is founded, I must doubt its truth."
5534,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Besides, the experience of nursery-men makes it the more questionable."
5535,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5536,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"The stories of wheat raised from seed buried with an ancient Egyptian,"
5537,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],and of raspberries raised from seed found in the stomach of a man in
5538,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"England, who is supposed to have died sixteen or seventeen hundred"
5539,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"years ago, are generally discredited, simply because the evidence is"
5540,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],not conclusive.
5541,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5542,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Several men of science, Dr. Carpenter among them, have used the"
5543,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],statement that beach plums sprang up in sand which was dug up forty
5544,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"miles inland in Maine, to prove that the seed had lain there a very"
5545,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"long time, and some have inferred that the coast has receded so far."
5546,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"But it seems to me necessary to their argument to show, first, that"
5547,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"beach plums grow only on a beach. They are not uncommon here, which is"
5548,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],about half that distance from the shore; and I remember a dense patch
5549,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"a few miles north of us, twenty-five miles inland, from which the"
5550,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],fruit was annually carried to market. How much further inland they
5551,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"grow, I know not. Dr. Charles T. Jackson speaks of finding ""beach"
5552,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"plums"" (perhaps they were this kind) more than one hundred miles"
5553,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],inland in Maine.
5554,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5555,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],It chances that similar objections lie against all the more notorious
5556,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],instances of the kind on record.
5557,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5558,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Yet I am prepared to believe that some seeds, especially small ones,"
5559,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],may retain their vitality for centuries under favorable circumstances.
5560,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"In the spring of 1859, the old Hunt house, so called, in this town,"
5561,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"whose chimney bore the date 1703, was taken down. This stood on land"
5562,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"which belonged to John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts,"
5563,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and a part of the house was evidently much older than the above date,"
5564,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],and belonged to the Winthrop family. For many years I have ransacked
5565,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"this neighborhood for plants, and I consider myself familiar with its"
5566,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],productions. Thinking of the seeds which are said to be sometimes dug
5567,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"up at an unusual depth in the earth, and thus to reproduce long"
5568,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"extinct plants, it occurred to me last fall that some new or rare"
5569,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"plants might have sprung up in the cellar of this house, which had"
5570,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],been covered from the light so long. Searching there on the 22d of
5571,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"September, I found, among other rank weeds, a species of nettle"
5572,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"(_Urtica urens_) which I had not found before; dill, which I had not"
5573,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seen growing spontaneously; the Jerusalem oak (_Chenopodium Botrys_),"
5574,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],which I had seen wild in but one place; black nightshade (_Solanum
5575,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"nigrum_), which is quite rare hereabouts, and common tobacco, which,"
5576,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"though it was often cultivated here in the last century, has for fifty"
5577,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"years been an unknown plant in this town, and a few months before this"
5578,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"not even I had heard that one man, in the north part of the town, was"
5579,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],cultivating a few plants for his own use. I have no doubt that some or
5580,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],all of these plants sprang from seeds which had long been buried under
5581,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"or about that house, and that that tobacco is an additional evidence"
5582,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],that the plant was formerly cultivated here. The cellar has been
5583,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"filled up this year, and four of those plants, including the tobacco,"
5584,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],are now again extinct in that locality.
5585,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5586,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"It is true, I have shown that the animals consume a great part of the"
5587,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"seeds of trees, and so, at least, effectually prevent their becoming"
5588,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"trees; but in all these cases, as I have said, the consumer is"
5589,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"compelled to be at the same time the disperser and planter, and this"
5590,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],is the tax which he pays to Nature. I think it is Linnæus who says
5591,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],that while the swine is rooting for acorns he is planting acorns.
5592,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5593,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],Though I do not believe that a plant will spring up where no seed has
5594,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"been, I have great faith in a seed,--a, to me, equally mysterious"
5595,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"origin for it. Convince me that you have a seed there, and I am"
5596,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],prepared to expect wonders. I shall even believe that the millennium
5597,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"is at hand, and that the reign of justice is about to commence, when"
5598,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the Patent Office, or Government, begins to distribute, and the people"
5599,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"to plant, the seeds of these things."
5600,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5601,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],In the spring of 1857 I planted six seeds sent to me from the Patent
5602,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"Office, and labeled, I think, _Poitrine jaune grosse_, large yellow"
5603,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"squash. Two came up, and one bore a squash which weighed 123½ pounds,"
5604,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"the other bore four, weighing together 186¼ pounds. Who would have"
5605,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],believed that there was 310 pounds of _poitrine jaune grosse_ in that
5606,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"corner of my garden? These seeds were the bait I used to catch it, my"
5607,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ferrets which I sent into its burrow, my brace of terriers which"
5608,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],unearthed it. A little mysterious hoeing and manuring was all the
5609,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"_abracadabra presto-change_ that I used, and lo! true to the label,"
5610,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"they found for me 310 pounds of _poitrine jaune grosse_ there, where"
5611,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"it never was known to be, nor was before. These talismans had"
5612,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"perchance sprung from America at first, and returned to it with"
5613,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"unabated force. The big squash took a premium at your fair that fall,"
5614,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"and I understood that the man who bought it, intended to sell the"
5615,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],seeds for ten cents apiece. (Were they not cheap at that?) But I have
5616,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],more hounds of the same breed. I learn that one which I despatched to
5617,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"a distant town, true to its instincts, points to the large yellow"
5618,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"squash there, too, where no hound ever found it before, as its"
5619,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],ancestors did here and in France.
5620,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],
5621,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],Other seeds I have which will find other things in that corner of my
5622,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"garden, in like fashion, almost any fruit you wish, every year for"
5623,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"ages, until the crop more than fills the whole garden. You have but"
5624,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],little more to do than throw up your cap for entertainment these
5625,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],American days. Perfect alchemists I keep who can transmute substances
5626,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"without end, and thus the corner of my garden is an inexhaustible"
5627,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"treasure-chest. Here you can dig, not gold, but the value which gold"
5628,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],merely represents; and there is no Signor Blitz about it. Yet farmers'
5629,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],sons will stare by the hour to see a juggler draw ribbons from his
5630,THE SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREES[6],"throat, though he tells them it is all deception. Surely, men love"

5653,WALKING,
5654,WALKING,I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who
5655,WALKING,"understood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks,--who had a"
5656,WALKING,"genius, so to speak, for _sauntering_, which word is beautifully"
5657,WALKING,"derived ""from idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle"
5658,WALKING,"Ages, and asked charity, under pretense of going _à la Sainte Terre_,"""
5659,WALKING,"to the Holy Land, till the children exclaimed, ""There goes a"
5660,WALKING,"_Sainte-Terrer_,"" a Saunterer, a Holy-Lander. They who never go to the"
5661,WALKING,"Holy Land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and"
5662,WALKING,"vagabonds; but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense,"
5663,WALKING,"such as I mean. Some, however, would derive the word from _sans"
5664,WALKING,"terre_, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense,"
5665,WALKING,"will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere."
5666,WALKING,For this is the secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in
5667,WALKING,a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all; but the
5668,WALKING,"saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering"
5669,WALKING,"river, which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course"
5670,WALKING,"to the sea. But I prefer the first, which, indeed, is the most"
5671,WALKING,"probable derivation. For every walk is a sort of crusade, preached by"
5672,WALKING,"some Peter the Hermit in us, to go forth and reconquer this Holy Land"
5673,WALKING,from the hands of the Infidels.
5674,WALKING,
5675,WALKING,"It is true, we are but faint-hearted crusaders, even the walkers,"
5676,WALKING,"nowadays, who undertake no persevering, never-ending enterprises. Our"
5677,WALKING,"expeditions are but tours, and come round again at evening to the old"
5678,WALKING,hearth-side from which we set out. Half the walk is but retracing our
5679,WALKING,"steps. We should go forth on the shortest walk, perchance, in the"
5680,WALKING,"spirit of undying adventure, never to return,--prepared to send back"
5681,WALKING,our embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms. If you
5682,WALKING,"are ready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife"

5731,WALKING,having all committed suicide long ago.
5732,WALKING,
5733,WALKING,"I, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring"
5734,WALKING,"some rust, and when sometimes I have stolen forth for a walk at the"
5735,WALKING,"eleventh hour, or four o'clock in the afternoon, too late to redeem"
5736,WALKING,"the day, when the shades of night were already beginning to be mingled"
5737,WALKING,"with the daylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be"
5738,WALKING,"atoned for,--I confess that I am astonished at the power of endurance,"
5739,WALKING,"to say nothing of the moral insensibility, of my neighbors who confine"
5740,WALKING,"themselves to shops and offices the whole day for weeks and months,"
5741,WALKING,"aye, and years almost together. I know not what manner of stuff they"
5742,WALKING,"are of,--sitting there now at three o'clock in the afternoon, as if it"
5743,WALKING,were three o'clock in the morning. Bonaparte may talk of the
5744,WALKING,"three-o'clock-in-the-morning courage, but it is nothing to the courage"
5745,WALKING,which can sit down cheerfully at this hour in the afternoon over
5746,WALKING,"against one's self whom you have known all the morning, to starve out"
5747,WALKING,a garrison to whom you are bound by such strong ties of sympathy. I
5748,WALKING,"wonder that about this time, or say between four and five o'clock in"
5749,WALKING,"the afternoon, too late for the morning papers and too early for the"
5750,WALKING,"evening ones, there is not a general explosion heard up and down the"
5751,WALKING,"street, scattering a legion of antiquated and house-bred notions and"
5752,WALKING,"whims to the four winds for an airing,--and so the evil cure itself."
5753,WALKING,
5754,WALKING,"How womankind, who are confined to the house still more than men,"
5755,WALKING,stand it I do not know; but I have ground to suspect that most of them
5756,WALKING,"do not _stand_ it at all. When, early in a summer afternoon, we have"
5757,WALKING,"been shaking the dust of the village from the skirts of our garments,"
5758,WALKING,"making haste past those houses with purely Doric or Gothic fronts,"
5759,WALKING,"which have such an air of repose about them, my companion whispers"
5760,WALKING,that probably about these times their occupants are all gone to bed.
5761,WALKING,"Then it is that I appreciate the beauty and the glory of architecture,"
5762,WALKING,"which itself never turns in, but forever stands out and erect, keeping"
5763,WALKING,watch over the slumberers.
5764,WALKING,
5765,WALKING,"No doubt temperament, and, above all, age, have a good deal to do with"
5766,WALKING,"it. As a man grows older, his ability to sit still and follow indoor"
5767,WALKING,occupations increases. He grows vespertinal in his habits as the
5768,WALKING,"evening of life approaches, till at last he comes forth only just"
5769,WALKING,"before sundown, and gets all the walk that he requires in half an"
5770,WALKING,hour.
5771,WALKING,
5772,WALKING,But the walking of which I speak has nothing in it akin to taking
5773,WALKING,"exercise, as it is called, as the sick take medicine at stated"
5774,WALKING,"hours,--as the swinging of dumbbells or chairs; but is itself the"
5775,WALKING,"enterprise and adventure of the day. If you would get exercise, go in"
5776,WALKING,search of the springs of life. Think of a man's swinging dumbbells for
5777,WALKING,"his health, when those springs are bubbling up in far-off pastures"
5778,WALKING,unsought by him!
5779,WALKING,
5780,WALKING,"Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only"
5781,WALKING,beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveler asked Wordsworth's
5782,WALKING,"servant to show him her master's study, she answered, ""Here is his"
5783,WALKING,"library, but his study is out of doors."""
5784,WALKING,
5785,WALKING,"Living much out of doors, in the sun and wind, will no doubt produce a"
5786,WALKING,"certain roughness of character,--will cause a thicker cuticle to grow"
5787,WALKING,"over some of the finer qualities of our nature, as on the face and"
5788,WALKING,"hands, or as severe manual labor robs the hands of some of their"
5789,WALKING,"delicacy of touch. So staying in the house, on the other hand, may"
5790,WALKING,"produce a softness and smoothness, not to say thinness of skin,"
5791,WALKING,accompanied by an increased sensibility to certain impressions.
5792,WALKING,Perhaps we should be more susceptible to some influences important to
5793,WALKING,"our intellectual and moral growth, if the sun had shone and the wind"
5794,WALKING,blown on us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to
5795,WALKING,proportion rightly the thick and thin skin. But methinks that is a
5796,WALKING,"scurf that will fall off fast enough,--that the natural remedy is to"
5797,WALKING,"be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day, the"
5798,WALKING,"winter to the summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the"
5799,WALKING,more air and sunshine in our thoughts. The callous palms of the
5800,WALKING,"laborer are conversant with finer tissues of self-respect and heroism,"
5801,WALKING,"whose touch thrills the heart, than the languid fingers of idleness."
5802,WALKING,That is mere sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself
5803,WALKING,"white, far from the tan and callus of experience."
5804,WALKING,
5805,WALKING,"When we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would"
5806,WALKING,"become of us, if we walked only in a garden or a mall? Even some"
5807,WALKING,sects of philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods
5808,WALKING,"to themselves, since they did not go to the woods. ""They planted"
5809,WALKING,"groves and walks of Platanes,"" where they took _subdiales"
5810,WALKING,ambulationes_ in porticos open to the air. Of course it is of no use
5811,WALKING,"to direct our steps to the woods, if they do not carry us thither. I"
5812,WALKING,am alarmed when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods
5813,WALKING,"bodily, without getting there in spirit. In my afternoon walk I would"
5814,WALKING,fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society.
5815,WALKING,But it sometimes happens that I cannot easily shake off the village.
5816,WALKING,The thought of some work will run in my head and I am not where my
5817,WALKING,"body is,--I am out of my senses. In my walks I would fain return to my"
5818,WALKING,"senses. What business have I in the woods, if I am thinking of"
5819,WALKING,"something out of the woods? I suspect myself, and cannot help a"
5820,WALKING,"shudder, when I find myself so implicated even in what are called good"
5821,WALKING,"works,--for this may sometimes happen."
5822,WALKING,
5823,WALKING,My vicinity affords many good walks; and though for so many years I
5824,WALKING,"have walked almost every day, and sometimes for several days together,"
5825,WALKING,I have not yet exhausted them. An absolutely new prospect is a great
5826,WALKING,"happiness, and I can still get this any afternoon. Two or three hours'"
5827,WALKING,walking will carry me to as strange a country as I expect ever to see.
5828,WALKING,A single farmhouse which I had not seen before is sometimes as good as
5829,WALKING,the dominions of the King of Dahomey. There is in fact a sort of
5830,WALKING,harmony discoverable between the capabilities of the landscape within
5831,WALKING,"a circle of ten miles' radius, or the limits of an afternoon walk, and"
5832,WALKING,the threescore years and ten of human life. It will never become
5833,WALKING,quite familiar to you.
5834,WALKING,
5835,WALKING,"Nowadays almost all man's improvements, so called, as the building of"
5836,WALKING,"houses and the cutting down of the forest and of all large trees,"
5837,WALKING,"simply deform the landscape, and make it more and more tame and cheap."
5838,WALKING,A people who would begin by burning the fences and let the forest
5839,WALKING,"stand! I saw the fences half consumed, their ends lost in the middle"
5840,WALKING,"of the prairie, and some worldly miser with a surveyor looking after"
5841,WALKING,"his bounds, while heaven had taken place around him, and he did not"
5842,WALKING,"see the angels going to and fro, but was looking for an old post-hole"
5843,WALKING,"in the midst of paradise. I looked again, and saw him standing in the"
5844,WALKING,"middle of a boggy Stygian fen, surrounded by devils, and he had found"
5845,WALKING,"his bounds without a doubt, three little stones, where a stake had"
5846,WALKING,"been driven, and looking nearer, I saw that the Prince of Darkness was"
5847,WALKING,his surveyor.
5848,WALKING,
5849,WALKING,"I can easily walk ten, fifteen, twenty, any number of miles,"
5850,WALKING,"commencing at my own door, without going by any house, without"
5851,WALKING,crossing a road except where the fox and the mink do: first along by
5852,WALKING,"the river, and then the brook, and then the meadow and the woodside."
5853,WALKING,There are square miles in my vicinity which have no inhabitant. From
5854,WALKING,many a hill I can see civilization and the abodes of man afar. The
5855,WALKING,farmers and their works are scarcely more obvious than woodchucks and
5856,WALKING,"their burrows. Man and his affairs, church and state and school, trade"
5857,WALKING,"and commerce, and manufactures and agriculture, even politics, the"
5858,WALKING,"most alarming of them all,--I am pleased to see how little space they"
5859,WALKING,"occupy in the landscape. Politics is but a narrow field, and that"
5860,WALKING,still narrower highway yonder leads to it. I sometimes direct the
5861,WALKING,"traveler thither. If you would go to the political world, follow the"
5862,WALKING,"great road,--follow that market-man, keep his dust in your eyes, and"
5863,WALKING,"it will lead you straight to it; for it, too, has its place merely,"
5864,WALKING,and does not occupy all space. I pass from it as from a bean-field
5865,WALKING,"into the forest, and it is forgotten. In one half-hour I can walk off"
5866,WALKING,to some portion of the earth's surface where a man does not stand from
5867,WALKING,"one year's end to another, and there, consequently, politics are not,"
5868,WALKING,for they are but as the cigar-smoke of a man.
5869,WALKING,
5870,WALKING,"The village is the place to which the roads tend, a sort of expansion"
5871,WALKING,"of the highway, as a lake of a river. It is the body of which roads"
5872,WALKING,"are the arms and legs,--a trivial or quadrivial place, the"
5873,WALKING,thoroughfare and ordinary of travelers. The word is from the Latin
5874,WALKING,"_villa_, which together with _via_, a way, or more anciently _ved_ and"
5875,WALKING,"_vella_, Varro derives from _veho_, to carry, because the villa is the"
5876,WALKING,place to and from which things are carried. They who got their living
5877,WALKING,"by teaming were said _vellaturam facere_. Hence, too, the Latin word"
5878,WALKING,"_vilis_ and our vile, also _villain_. This suggests what kind of"
5879,WALKING,degeneracy villagers are liable to. They are wayworn by the travel
5880,WALKING,"that goes by and over them, without traveling themselves."
5881,WALKING,
5882,WALKING,Some do not walk at all; others walk in the highways; a few walk
5883,WALKING,across lots. Roads are made for horses and men of business. I do not
5884,WALKING,"travel in them much, comparatively, because I am not in a hurry to get"
5885,WALKING,to any tavern or grocery or livery-stable or depot to which they
5886,WALKING,"lead. I am a good horse to travel, but not from choice a roadster. The"
5887,WALKING,landscape-painter uses the figures of men to mark a road. He would not
5888,WALKING,make that use of my figure. I walk out into a nature such as the old
5889,WALKING,"prophets and poets, Menu, Moses, Homer, Chaucer, walked in. You may"
5890,WALKING,"name it America, but it is not America; neither Americus Vespucius,"
5891,WALKING,"nor Columbus, nor the rest were the discoverers of it. There is a"
5892,WALKING,"truer account of it in mythology than in any history of America, so"
5893,WALKING,"called, that I have seen."
5894,WALKING,
5895,WALKING,"However, there are a few old roads that may be trodden with profit, as"
5896,WALKING,if they led somewhere now that they are nearly discontinued. There is
5897,WALKING,"the Old Marlborough Road, which does not go to Marlborough now,"
5898,WALKING,"methinks, unless that is Marlborough where it carries me. I am the"
5899,WALKING,"bolder to speak of it here, because I presume that there are one or"
5900,WALKING,two such roads in every town.

5939,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Great guide-boards of stone,"

5941,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Cenotaphs of the towns
5942,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Named on their crowns.

5955,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Where a traveler might groan,"

5959,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,In his extreme need.
5960,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I know one or two
5961,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Lines that would do,"
5962,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Literature that might stand
5963,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"All over the land,"
5964,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Which a man could remember

5972,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
5973,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"At present, in this vicinity, the best part of the land is not private"
5974,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"property; the landscape is not owned, and the walker enjoys"
5975,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,comparative freedom. But possibly the day will come when it will be
5976,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"partitioned off into so-called pleasure-grounds, in which a few will"
5977,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"take a narrow and exclusive pleasure only,--when fences shall be"
5978,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"multiplied, and man-traps and other engines invented to confine men to"
5979,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the _public_ road, and walking over the surface of God's earth shall"
5980,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,be construed to mean trespassing on some gentleman's grounds. To enjoy
5981,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,a thing exclusively is commonly to exclude yourself from the true
5982,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"enjoyment of it. Let us improve our opportunities, then, before the"

5986,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
5987,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,What is it that makes it so hard sometimes to determine whither we
5988,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"will walk? I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature,"
5989,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"which, if we unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright. It is"
5990,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,not indifferent to us which way we walk. There is a right way; but we
5991,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,are very liable from heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one.
5992,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"We would fain take that walk, never yet taken by us through this"
5993,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"actual world, which is perfectly symbolical of the path which we love"
5994,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"to travel in the interior and ideal world; and sometimes, no doubt, we"
5995,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"find it difficult to choose our direction, because it does not yet"
5996,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,exist distinctly in our idea.
5997,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
5998,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"When I go out of the house for a walk, uncertain as yet whither I will"
5999,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"bend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me, I"
6000,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and"
6001,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"inevitably settle southwest, toward some particular wood or meadow or"
6002,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to
6003,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"settle,--varies a few degrees, and does not always point due"
6004,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this variation,"
6005,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,but it always settles between west and south-southwest. The future
6006,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer"
6007,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"on that side. The outline which would bound my walks would be, not a"
6008,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits"
6009,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"which have been thought to be non-returning curves, in this case"
6010,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"opening westward, in which my house occupies the place of the sun. I"
6011,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour,"
6012,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"until I decide, for a thousandth time, that I will walk into the"
6013,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,southwest or west. Eastward I go only by force; but westward I go
6014,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,free. Thither no business leads me. It is hard for me to believe that
6015,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind
6016,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,the eastern horizon. I am not excited by the prospect of a walk
6017,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,thither; but I believe that the forest which I see in the western
6018,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, and there"
6019,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me.
6020,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Let me live where I will, on this side is the city, on that the"
6021,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and more, and"
6022,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much stress on
6023,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"this fact, if I did not believe that something like this is the"
6024,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and"
6025,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"not toward Europe. And that way the nation is moving, and I may say"
6026,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,that mankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have
6027,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"witnessed the phenomenon of a southeastward migration, in the"
6028,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"settlement of Australia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement,"
6029,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and, judging from the moral and physical character of the first"
6030,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"generation of Australians, has not yet proved a successful experiment."
6031,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,The eastern Tartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet.
6032,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"""The world ends there,"" say they; ""beyond there is nothing but a"
6033,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"shoreless sea."" It is unmitigated East where they live."
6034,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6035,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,We go eastward to realize history and study the works of art and
6036,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"literature, retracing the steps of the race; we go westward as into"
6037,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the future, with a spirit of enterprise and adventure. The Atlantic is"
6038,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"a Lethean stream, in our passage over which we have had an opportunity"
6039,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,to forget the Old World and its institutions. If we do not succeed
6040,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"this time, there is perhaps one more chance for the race left before"
6041,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,it arrives on the banks of the Styx; and that is in the Lethe of the
6042,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Pacific, which is three times as wide."
6043,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6044,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"I know not how significant it is, or how far it is an evidence of"
6045,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"singularity, that an individual should thus consent in his pettiest"
6046,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,walk with the general movement of the race; but I know that something
6047,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"akin to the migratory instinct in birds and quadrupeds,--which, in"
6048,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"some instances, is known to have affected the squirrel tribe,"
6049,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"impelling them to a general and mysterious movement, in which they"
6050,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"were seen, say some, crossing the broadest rivers, each on its"
6051,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"particular chip, with its tail raised for a sail, and bridging"

6182,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Some months ago I went to see a panorama of the Rhine. It was like a

6185,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and repaired by later heroes, past cities and castles whose very names"

6187,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"There were Ehrenbreitstein and Rolandseck and Coblentz, which I knew"

6200,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Cliff,--still thinking more of the future than of the past or"

6212,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,The cities import it at any price. Men plow and sail for it. From the

6214,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Our ancestors were savages. The story of Romulus and Remus being

6217,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,vigor from a similar wild source. It was because the children of the

6229,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,stolen a march on the cooks of Paris. They get what usually goes to
6230,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,feed the fire. This is probably better than stall-fed beef and
6231,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,slaughter-house pork to make a man of. Give me a wildness whose glance
6232,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"no civilization can endure,--as if we lived on the marrow of koodoos"

6276,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"formerly, I have analyzed my partiality for some farm which I had"
6277,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"contemplated purchasing, I have frequently found that I was attracted"
6278,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"solely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable bog,--a"

6280,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my
6281,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,native town than from the cultivated gardens in the village. There are

6283,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,(_Cassandra calyculata_) which cover these tender places on the

6286,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"lambkill, azalea, and rhodora,--all standing in the quaking sphagnum."
6287,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I often think that I should like to have my house front on this mass
6288,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"of dull red bushes, omitting other flower plots and borders,"
6289,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"transplanted spruce and trim box, even graveled walks,--to have this"
6290,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"fertile spot under my windows, not a few imported barrowfuls of soil"
6291,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,only to cover the sand which was thrown out in digging the cellar. Why

6293,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"meagre assemblage of curiosities, that poor apology for a Nature and"
6294,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Art, which I call my front yard? It is an effort to clear up and make"
6295,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"a decent appearance when the carpenter and mason have departed, though"
6296,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,done as much for the passer-by as the dweller within. The most
6297,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,tasteful front-yard fence was never an agreeable object of study to
6298,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"me; the most elaborate ornaments, acorn tops, or what not, soon"
6299,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,wearied and disgusted me. Bring your sills up to the very edge of the
6300,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"swamp, then (though it may not be the best place for a dry cellar), so"
6301,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,that there be no access on that side to citizens. Front yards are not

6329,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,the woods and swamps that surround it. A township where one primitive

6331,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"town is fitted to raise not only corn and potatoes, but poets and"

6336,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,To preserve wild animals implies generally the creation of a forest
6337,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,for them to dwell in or resort to. So it is with man. A hundred years
6338,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,ago they sold bark in our streets peeled from our own woods. In the
6339,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"very aspect of those primitive and rugged trees there was, methinks, a"
6340,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,tanning principle which hardened and consolidated the fibres of men's
6341,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,thoughts. Ah! already I shudder for these comparatively degenerate
6342,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"days of my native village, when you cannot collect a load of bark of"
6343,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"good thickness, and we no longer produce tar and turpentine."
6344,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6345,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"The civilized nations--Greece, Rome, England--have been sustained by"
6346,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,the primitive forests which anciently rotted where they stand. They
6347,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,survive as long as the soil is not exhausted. Alas for human culture!
6348,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"little is to be expected of a nation, when the vegetable mould is"
6349,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"exhausted, and it is compelled to make manure of the bones of its"
6350,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,fathers. There the poet sustains himself merely by his own superfluous
6351,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"fat, and the philosopher comes down on his marrow-bones."
6352,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6353,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"It is said to be the task of the American ""to work the virgin soil,"""
6354,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and that ""agriculture here already assumes proportions unknown"
6355,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"everywhere else."" I think that the farmer displaces the Indian even"
6356,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"because he redeems the meadow, and so makes himself stronger and in"
6357,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,some respects more natural. I was surveying for a man the other day a
6358,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"single straight line one hundred and thirty-two rods long, through a"
6359,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,swamp at whose entrance might have been written the words which Dante
6360,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"read over the entrance to the infernal regions, ""Leave all hope, ye"
6361,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"that enter,""--that is, of ever getting out again; where at one time I"
6362,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,saw my employer actually up to his neck and swimming for his life in
6363,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"his property, though it was still winter. He had another similar swamp"
6364,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"which I could not survey at all, because it was completely under"
6365,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"water, and nevertheless, with regard to a third swamp, which I did"
6366,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"_survey_ from a distance, he remarked to me, true to his instincts,"
6367,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"that he would not part with it for any consideration, on account of"
6368,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,the mud which it contained. And that man intends to put a girdling
6369,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"ditch round the whole in the course of forty months, and so redeem it"
6370,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,by the magic of his spade. I refer to him only as the type of a class.

6372,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"The weapons with which we have gained our most important victories,"
6373,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"which should be handed down as heirlooms from father to son, are not"
6374,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the sword and the lance, but the bushwhack, the turf-cutter, the"
6375,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"spade, and the bog hoe, rusted with the blood of many a meadow, and"
6376,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,begrimed with the dust of many a hard-fought field. The very winds
6377,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"blew the Indian's corn-field into the meadow, and pointed out the way"
6378,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,which he had not the skill to follow. He had no better implement with
6379,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,which to intrench himself in the land than a clamshell. But the farmer
6380,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,is armed with plow and spade.
6381,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6382,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,In literature it is only the wild that attracts us. Dullness is but
6383,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,another name for tameness. It is the uncivilized free and wild
6384,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"thinking in Hamlet and the Iliad, in all the scriptures and"
6385,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"mythologies, not learned in the schools, that delights us. As the wild"
6386,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"duck is more swift and beautiful than the tame, so is the wild--the"
6387,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"mallard--thought, which 'mid falling dews wings its way above the"
6388,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"fens. A truly good book is something as natural, and as unexpectedly"
6389,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and unaccountably fair and perfect, as a wild-flower discovered on the"
6390,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,prairies of the West or in the jungles of the East. Genius is a light
6391,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"which makes the darkness visible, like the lightning's flash, which"
6392,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"perchance shatters the temple of knowledge itself,--and not a taper"
6393,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"lighted at the hearth-stone of the race, which pales before the light"
6394,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,of common day.
6395,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6396,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"English literature, from the days of the minstrels to the Lake"
6397,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Poets,--Chaucer and Spenser and Milton, and even Shakespeare,"
6398,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"included,--breathes no quite fresh and, in this sense, wild strain. It"
6399,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"is an essentially tame and civilized literature, reflecting Greece and"
6400,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Rome. Her wilderness is a greenwood, her wild man a Robin Hood. There"
6401,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"is plenty of genial love of Nature, but not so much of Nature herself."
6402,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Her chronicles inform us when her wild animals, but not when the wild"
6403,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"man in her, became extinct."
6404,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6405,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"The science of Humboldt is one thing, poetry is another thing. The"
6406,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"poet to-day, notwithstanding all the discoveries of science, and the"
6407,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"accumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer."
6408,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6409,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Where is the literature which gives expression to Nature? He would be
6410,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"a poet who could impress the winds and streams into his service, to"
6411,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"speak for him; who nailed words to their primitive senses, as farmers"
6412,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"drive down stakes in the spring, which the frost has heaved; who"
6413,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"derived his words as often as he used them,--transplanted them to his"
6414,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,page with earth adhering to their roots; whose words were so true and
6415,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,fresh and natural that they would appear to expand like the buds at
6416,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the approach of spring, though they lay half smothered between two"
6417,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"musty leaves in a library,--aye, to bloom and bear fruit there, after"
6418,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"their kind, annually, for the faithful reader, in sympathy with"
6419,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,surrounding Nature.
6420,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6421,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I do not know of any poetry to quote which adequately expresses this
6422,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"yearning for the Wild. Approached from this side, the best poetry is"
6423,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"tame. I do not know where to find in any literature, ancient or"
6424,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"modern, any account which contents me of that Nature with which even I"
6425,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,am acquainted. You will perceive that I demand something which no
6426,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Augustan nor Elizabethan age, which no _culture_, in short, can give."
6427,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Mythology comes nearer to it than anything. How much more fertile a
6428,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Nature, at least, has Grecian mythology its root in than English"
6429,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,literature! Mythology is the crop which the Old World bore before its
6430,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"soil was exhausted, before the fancy and imagination were affected"
6431,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"with blight; and which it still bears, wherever its pristine vigor is"
6432,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,unabated. All other literatures endure only as the elms which
6433,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,overshadow our houses; but this is like the great dragon-tree of the
6434,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Western Isles, as old as mankind, and, whether that does or not, will"
6435,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,endure as long; for the decay of other literatures makes the soil in
6436,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,which it thrives.
6437,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6438,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,The West is preparing to add its fables to those of the East. The
6439,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"valleys of the Ganges, the Nile, and the Rhine having yielded their"
6440,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"crop, it remains to be seen what the valleys of the Amazon, the Plate,"
6441,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the Orinoco, the St. Lawrence, and the Mississippi will produce."
6442,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Perchance, when, in the course of ages, American liberty has become a"
6443,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"fiction of the past,--as it is to some extent a fiction of the"
6444,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"present,--the poets of the world will be inspired by American"
6445,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,mythology.
6446,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6447,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"The wildest dreams of wild men, even, are not the less true, though"
6448,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,they may not recommend themselves to the sense which is most common
6449,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,among Englishmen and Americans to-day. It is not every truth that
6450,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,recommends itself to the common sense. Nature has a place for the wild
6451,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,clematis as well as for the cabbage. Some expressions of truth are
6452,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"reminiscent,--others merely _sensible_, as the phrase is,--others"
6453,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"prophetic. Some forms of disease, even, may prophesy forms of health."
6454,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"The geologist has discovered that the figures of serpents, griffins,"
6455,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"flying dragons, and other fanciful embellishments of heraldry, have"
6456,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,their prototypes in the forms of fossil species which were extinct
6457,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"before man was created, and hence ""indicate a faint and shadowy"
6458,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"knowledge of a previous state of organic existence."" The Hindoos"
6459,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"dreamed that the earth rested on an elephant, and the elephant on a"
6460,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"tortoise, and the tortoise on a serpent; and though it may be an"
6461,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"unimportant coincidence, it will not be out of place here to state,"
6462,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,that a fossil tortoise has lately been discovered in Asia large enough
6463,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,to support an elephant. I confess that I am partial to these wild
6464,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"fancies, which transcend the order of time and development. They are"
6465,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the sublimest recreation of the intellect. The partridge loves peas,"
6466,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,but not those that go with her into the pot.
6467,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6468,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"In short, all good things are wild and free. There is something in a"
6469,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"strain of music, whether produced by an instrument or by the human"
6470,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"voice,--take the sound of a bugle in a summer night, for"
6471,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"instance,--which by its wildness, to speak without satire, reminds me"
6472,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,of the cries emitted by wild beasts in their native forests. It is so
6473,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,much of their wildness as I can understand. Give me for my friends and
6474,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"neighbors wild men, not tame ones. The wildness of the savage is but a"
6475,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,faint symbol of the awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet.
6476,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6477,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I love even to see the domestic animals reassert their native
6478,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"rights,--any evidence that they have not wholly lost their original"
6479,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,wild habits and vigor; as when my neighbor's cow breaks out of her
6480,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"pasture early in the spring and boldly swims the river, a cold, gray"
6481,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"tide, twenty-five or thirty rods wide, swollen by the melted snow. It"
6482,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,is the buffalo crossing the Mississippi. This exploit confers some
6483,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"dignity on the herd in my eyes,--already dignified. The seeds of"
6484,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"instinct are preserved under the thick hides of cattle and horses,"
6485,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"like seeds in the bowels of the earth, an indefinite period."
6486,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6487,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Any sportiveness in cattle is unexpected. I saw one day a herd of a
6488,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"dozen bullocks and cows running about and frisking in unwieldy sport,"
6489,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"like huge rats, even like kittens. They shook their heads, raised"
6490,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"their tails, and rushed up and down a hill, and I perceived by their"
6491,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"horns, as well as by their activity, their relation to the deer tribe."
6492,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"But, alas! a sudden loud _Whoa!_ would have damped their ardor at"
6493,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"once, reduced them from venison to beef, and stiffened their sides and"
6494,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sinews like the locomotive. Who but the Evil One has cried ""Whoa!"" to"
6495,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"mankind? Indeed, the life of cattle, like that of many men, is but a"
6496,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sort of locomotiveness; they move a side at a time, and man, by his"
6497,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"machinery, is meeting the horse and the ox half-way. Whatever part the"
6498,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,whip has touched is thenceforth palsied. Who would ever think of a
6499,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"_side_ of any of the supple cat tribe, as we speak of a _side_ of"
6500,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,beef?
6501,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6502,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I rejoice that horses and steers have to be broken before they can be
6503,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"made the slaves of men, and that men themselves have some wild oats"
6504,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,still left to sow before they become submissive members of society.
6505,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Undoubtedly, all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization;"
6506,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and because the majority, like dogs and sheep, are tame by inherited"
6507,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"disposition, this is no reason why the others should have their"
6508,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level. Men are in
6509,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the main alike, but they were made several in order that they might be"
6510,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"various. If a low use is to be served, one man will do nearly or quite"
6511,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"as well as another; if a high one, individual excellence is to be"
6512,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"regarded. Any man can stop a hole to keep the wind away, but no other"
6513,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,man could serve so rare a use as the author of this illustration did.
6514,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Confucius says, ""The skins of the tiger and the leopard, when they are"
6515,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"tanned, are as the skins of the dog and the sheep tanned."" But it is"
6516,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"not the part of a true culture to tame tigers, any more than it is to"
6517,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,make sheep ferocious; and tanning their skins for shoes is not the
6518,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,best use to which they can be put.

6523,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"military officers, or of authors who have written on a particular"
6524,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"subject, I am reminded once more that there is nothing in a name. The"
6525,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"name Menschikoff, for instance, has nothing in it to my ears more"
6526,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"human than a whisker, and it may belong to a rat. As the names of the"
6527,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Poles and Russians are to us, so are ours to them. It is as if they"

6530,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"over the earth, and to each the herdsman has affixed some barbarous"
6531,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sound in his own dialect. The names of men are, of course, as cheap"

6534,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Methinks it would be some advantage to philosophy if men were named

6536,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"know the genus and perhaps the race or variety, to know the"
6537,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,individual. We are not prepared to believe that every private soldier
6538,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"in a Roman army had a name of his own,--because we have not supposed"
6539,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,that he had a character of his own.

6541,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"At present our only true names are nicknames. I knew a boy who, from"

6544,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Indian had no name given him at first, but earned it, and his name was"
6545,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,his fame; and among some tribes he acquired a new name with every new

6549,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"I will not allow mere names to make distinctions for me, but still see"

6552,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"own wild title earned in the woods. We have a wild savage in us, and a"
6553,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,savage name is perchance somewhere recorded as ours. I see that my

6611,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,ignorance? What we call knowledge is often our positive ignorance;
6612,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,ignorance our negative knowledge. By long years of patient industry
6613,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"and reading of the newspapers,--for what are the libraries of science"
6614,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"but files of newspapers?--a man accumulates a myriad facts, lays them"
6615,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"up in his memory, and then when in some spring of his life he saunters"
6616,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"abroad into the Great Fields of thought, he, as it were, goes to grass"
6617,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,like a horse and leaves all his harness behind in the stable. I would
6618,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"say to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,"
6619,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sometimes,--Go to grass. You have eaten hay long enough. The spring"
6620,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,has come with its green crop. The very cows are driven to their
6621,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,country pastures before the end of May; though I have heard of one
6622,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,unnatural farmer who kept his cow in the barn and fed her on hay all
6623,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"the year round. So, frequently, the Society for the Diffusion of"
6624,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Useful Knowledge treats its cattle.
6625,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6626,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"A man's ignorance sometimes is not only useful, but beautiful,--while"
6627,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"his knowledge, so called, is oftentimes worse than useless, besides"
6628,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"being ugly. Which is the best man to deal with,--he who knows nothing"
6629,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"about a subject, and, what is extremely rare, knows that he knows"
6630,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"nothing, or he who really knows something about it, but thinks that he"
6631,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,knows all?

6633,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"My desire for knowledge is intermittent, but my desire to bathe my"
6634,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,head in atmospheres unknown to my feet is perennial and constant. The
6635,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"highest that we can attain to is not Knowledge, but Sympathy with"
6636,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Intelligence. I do not know that this higher knowledge amounts to
6637,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,anything more definite than a novel and grand surprise on a sudden
6638,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,revelation of the insufficiency of all that we called Knowledge
6639,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"before,--a discovery that there are more things in heaven and earth"
6640,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,than are dreamed of in our philosophy. It is the lighting up of the
6641,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"mist by the sun. Man cannot _know_ in any higher sense than this, any"
6642,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,more than he can look serenely and with impunity in the face of the
6643,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sun: [Greek: Hôs ti noôn, ou keinon noêseis], ""You will not perceive"

6645,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6646,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,There is something servile in the habit of seeking after a law which
6647,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,we may obey. We may study the laws of matter at and for our
6648,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"convenience, but a successful life knows no law. It is an unfortunate"
6649,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"discovery certainly, that of a law which binds us where we did not"
6650,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"know before that we were bound. Live free, child of the mist,--and"
6651,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,with respect to knowledge we are all children of the mist. The man who
6652,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"takes the liberty to live is superior to all the laws, by virtue of"
6653,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"his relation to the lawmaker. ""That is active duty,"" says the Vishnu"

6713,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,I took a walk on Spaulding's Farm the other afternoon. I saw the
6714,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,setting sun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine wood. Its
6715,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,golden rays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble
6716,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,hall. I was impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and
6717,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,shining family had settled there in that part of the land called
6718,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"Concord, unknown to me,--to whom the sun was servant,--who had not"
6719,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"gone into society in the village,--who had not been called on. I saw"
6720,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"their park, their pleasure-ground, beyond through the wood, in"
6721,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Spaulding's cranberry-meadow. The pines furnished them with gables as
6722,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,they grew. Their house was not obvious to vision; the trees grew
6723,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,through it. I do not know whether I heard the sounds of a suppressed
6724,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,hilarity or not. They seemed to recline on the sunbeams. They have
6725,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"sons and daughters. They are quite well. The farmer's cart-path, which"
6726,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"leads directly through their hall, does not in the least put them out,"
6727,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,as the muddy bottom of a pool is sometimes seen through the reflected
6728,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"skies. They never heard of Spaulding, and do not know that he is their"
6729,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"neighbor,--notwithstanding I heard him whistle as he drove his team"
6730,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,through the house. Nothing can equal the serenity of their lives.
6731,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,Their coat-of-arms is simply a lichen. I saw it painted on the pines
6732,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,and oaks. Their attics were in the tops of the trees. They are of no
6733,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,politics. There was no noise of labor. I did not perceive that they
6734,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"were weaving or spinning. Yet I did detect, when the wind lulled and"
6735,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"hearing was done away, the finest imaginable sweet musical hum,--as of"
6736,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"a distant hive in May,--which perchance was the sound of their"
6737,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"thinking. They had no idle thoughts, and no one without could see"
6738,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"their work, for their industry was not as in knots and excrescences"
6739,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,embayed.
6740,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,
6741,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,But I find it difficult to remember them. They fade irrevocably out of
6742,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"my mind even now while I speak, and endeavor to recall them and"
6743,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,recollect myself. It is only after a long and serious effort to
6744,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,recollect my best thoughts that I become again aware of their

6824,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"leaves of the shrub oaks on the hillside, while our shadows stretched"
6825,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"long over the meadow eastward, as if we were the only motes in its"

6827,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"before, and the air also was so warm and serene that nothing was"
6828,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,wanting to make a paradise of that meadow. When we reflected that this
6829,THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD,"was not a solitary phenomenon, never to happen again, but that it"

6894,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"Generally, every fruit, on ripening, and just before it falls, when it"
6895,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"commences a more independent and individual existence, requiring less"
6896,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"nourishment from any source, and that not so much from the earth"
6897,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"through its stem as from the sun and air, acquires a bright tint. So"
6898,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"do leaves. The physiologist says it is ""due to an increased absorption"
6899,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"of oxygen."" That is the scientific account of the matter,--only a"
6900,AUTUMNAL TINTS,reassertion of the fact. But I am more interested in the rosy cheek
6901,AUTUMNAL TINTS,than I am to know what particular diet the maiden fed on. The very
6902,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"forest and herbage, the pellicle of the earth, must acquire a bright"
6903,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"color, an evidence of its ripeness,--as if the globe itself were a"
6904,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"fruit on its stem, with ever a cheek toward the sun."
6905,AUTUMNAL TINTS,
6906,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"Flowers are but colored leaves, fruits but ripe ones. The edible part"
6907,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"of most fruits is, as the physiologist says, ""the parenchyma or fleshy"

6910,AUTUMNAL TINTS,Our appetites have commonly confined our views of ripeness and its
6911,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"phenomena, color, mellowness, and perfectness, to the fruits which we"
6912,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"eat, and we are wont to forget that an immense harvest which we do not"
6913,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"eat, hardly use at all, is annually ripened by Nature. At our annual"
6914,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"cattle-shows and horticultural exhibitions, we make, as we think, a"
6915,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"great show of fair fruits, destined, however, to a rather ignoble end,"
6916,AUTUMNAL TINTS,fruits not valued for their beauty chiefly. But round about and within
6917,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"our towns there is annually another show of fruits, on an infinitely"
6918,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"grander scale, fruits which address our taste for beauty alone."
6919,AUTUMNAL TINTS,
6920,AUTUMNAL TINTS,October is the month for painted leaves. Their rich glow now flashes
6921,AUTUMNAL TINTS,round the world. As fruits and leaves and the day itself acquire a
6922,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"bright tint just before they fall, so the year near its setting."
6923,AUTUMNAL TINTS,October is its sunset sky; November the later twilight.
6924,AUTUMNAL TINTS,
6925,AUTUMNAL TINTS,I formerly thought that it would be worth the while to get a specimen
6926,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"leaf from each changing tree, shrub, and herbaceous plant, when it had"
6927,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"acquired its brightest characteristic color, in its transition from"
6928,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"the green to the brown state, outline it, and copy its color exactly,"
6929,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"with paint, in a book, which should be entitled ""October, or Autumnal"
6930,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"Tints,""--beginning with the earliest reddening woodbine and the lake"
6931,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"of radical leaves, and coming down through the maples, hickories, and"
6932,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"sumachs, and many beautifully freckled leaves less generally known, to"
6933,AUTUMNAL TINTS,the latest oaks and aspens. What a memento such a book would be! You
6934,AUTUMNAL TINTS,would need only to turn over its leaves to take a ramble through the
6935,AUTUMNAL TINTS,autumn woods whenever you pleased. Or if I could preserve the leaves
6936,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"themselves, unfaded, it would be better still. I have made but little"
6937,AUTUMNAL TINTS,"progress toward such a book, but I have endeavored, instead, to"
6938,AUTUMNAL TINTS,describe all these bright tints in the order in which they present
6939,AUTUMNAL TINTS,themselves. The following are some extracts from my notes.
6940,AUTUMNAL TINTS,
6941,AUTUMNAL TINTS,
6942,THE PURPLE GRASSES,THE PURPLE GRASSES
6943,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
6944,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"By the twentieth of August, everywhere in woods and swamps we are"
6945,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"reminded of the fall, both by the richly spotted sarsaparilla leaves"
6946,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"and brakes, and the withering and blackened skunk-cabbage and"
6947,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"hellebore, and, by the riverside, the already blackening pontederia."
6948,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
6949,THE PURPLE GRASSES,The purple grass (_Eragrostis pectinacea_) is now in the height of its
6950,THE PURPLE GRASSES,beauty. I remember still when I first noticed this grass particularly.
6951,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"Standing on a hillside near our river, I saw, thirty or forty rods"
6952,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"off, a stripe of purple half a dozen rods long, under the edge of a"
6953,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"wood, where the ground sloped toward a meadow. It was as high-colored"
6954,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"and interesting, though not quite so bright, as the patches of rhexia,"
6955,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"being a darker purple, like a berry's stain laid on close and thick."
6956,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"On going to and examining it, I found it to be a kind of grass in"
6957,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"bloom, hardly a foot high, with but few green blades, and a fine"
6958,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"spreading panicle of purple flowers, a shallow, purplish mist"
6959,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"trembling around me. Close at hand it appeared but a dull purple, and"
6960,THE PURPLE GRASSES,made little impression on the eye; it was even difficult to detect;
6961,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"and if you plucked a single plant, you were surprised to find how thin"
6962,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"it was, and how little color it had. But viewed at a distance in a"
6963,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"favorable light, it was of a fine lively purple, flower-like,"
6964,THE PURPLE GRASSES,enriching the earth. Such puny causes combine to produce these decided
6965,THE PURPLE GRASSES,effects. I was the more surprised and charmed because grass is
6966,THE PURPLE GRASSES,commonly of a sober and humble color.
6967,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
6968,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"With its beautiful purple blush it reminds me, and supplies the"
6969,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"place, of the rhexia, which is now leaving off, and it is one of the"
6970,THE PURPLE GRASSES,most interesting phenomena of August. The finest patches of it grow on
6971,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"waste strips or selvages of land at the base of dry hills, just above"
6972,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"the edge of the meadows, where the greedy mower does not deign to"
6973,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"swing his scythe; for this is a thin and poor grass, beneath his"
6974,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"notice. Or, it may be, because it is so beautiful he does not know"
6975,THE PURPLE GRASSES,that it exists; for the same eye does not see this and timothy. He
6976,THE PURPLE GRASSES,carefully gets the meadow-hay and the more nutritious grasses which
6977,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"grow next to that, but he leaves this fine purple mist for the"
6978,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"walker's harvest,--fodder for his fancy stock. Higher up the hill,"
6979,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"perchance, grow also blackberries, John's-wort, and neglected,"
6980,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"withered, and wiry June-grass. How fortunate that it grows in such"
6981,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"places, and not in the midst of the rank grasses which are annually"
6982,THE PURPLE GRASSES,cut! Nature thus keeps use and beauty distinct. I know many such
6983,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"localities, where it does not fail to present itself annually, and"
6984,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"paint the earth with its blush. It grows on the gentle slopes, either"
6985,THE PURPLE GRASSES,in a continuous patch or in scattered and rounded tufts a foot in
6986,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"diameter, and it lasts till it is killed by the first smart frosts."
6987,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
6988,THE PURPLE GRASSES,In most plants the corolla or calyx is the part which attains the
6989,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"highest color, and is the most attractive; in many it is the"
6990,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"seed-vessel or fruit; in others, as the red maple, the leaves; and in"
6991,THE PURPLE GRASSES,others still it is the very culm itself which is the principal flower
6992,THE PURPLE GRASSES,or blooming part.
6993,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
6994,THE PURPLE GRASSES,The last is especially the case with the poke or garget (_Phytolacca
6995,THE PURPLE GRASSES,decandra_). Some which stand under our cliffs quite dazzle me with
6996,THE PURPLE GRASSES,their purple stems now and early in September. They are as interesting
6997,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"to me as most flowers, and one of the most important fruits of our"
6998,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"autumn. Every part is flower (or fruit), such is its superfluity of"
6999,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"color,--stem, branch, peduncle, pedicel, petiole, and even the at"
7000,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"length yellowish, purple-veined leaves. Its cylindrical racemes of"
7001,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"berries of various hues, from green to dark purple, six or seven"
7002,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"inches long, are gracefully drooping on all sides, offering repasts to"
7003,THE PURPLE GRASSES,the birds; and even the sepals from which the birds have picked the
7004,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"berries are a brilliant lake red, with crimson flame-like reflections,"
7005,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"equal to anything of the kind,--all on fire with ripeness. Hence the"
7006,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"_lacca_, from _lac_, lake. There are at the same time flower-buds,"
7007,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"flowers, green berries, dark-purple or ripe ones, and these"
7008,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"flower-like sepals, all on the same plant."
7009,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7010,THE PURPLE GRASSES,We love to see any redness in the vegetation of the temperate zone. It
7011,THE PURPLE GRASSES,is the color of colors. This plant speaks to our blood. It asks a
7012,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"bright sun on it to make it show to best advantage, and it must be"
7013,THE PURPLE GRASSES,seen at this season of the year. On warm hillsides its stems are ripe
7014,THE PURPLE GRASSES,by the twenty-third of August. At that date I walked through a
7015,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"beautiful grove of them, six or seven feet high, on the side of one of"
7016,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"our cliffs, where they ripen early. Quite to the ground they were a"
7017,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"deep, brilliant purple, with a bloom contrasting with the still clear"
7018,THE PURPLE GRASSES,green leaves. It appears a rare triumph of Nature to have produced and
7019,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"perfected such a plant, as if this were enough for a summer. What a"
7020,THE PURPLE GRASSES,perfect maturity it arrives at! It is the emblem of a successful life
7021,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"concluded by a death not premature, which is an ornament to Nature."
7022,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"What if we were to mature as perfectly, root and branch, glowing in"
7023,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"the midst of our decay, like the poke! I confess that it excites me to"
7024,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"behold them. I cut one for a cane, for I would fain handle and lean on"
7025,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"it. I love to press the berries between my fingers, and see their"
7026,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"juice staining my hand. To walk amid these upright, branching casks of"
7027,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"purple wine, which retain and diffuse a sunset glow, tasting each one"
7028,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"with your eye, instead of counting the pipes on a London dock, what a"
7029,THE PURPLE GRASSES,privilege! For Nature's vintage is not confined to the vine. Our poets
7030,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"have sung of wine, the product of a foreign plant which commonly they"
7031,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"never saw, as if our own plants had no juice in them more than the"
7032,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"singers. Indeed, this has been called by some the American grape, and,"
7033,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"though a native of America, its juices are used in some foreign"
7034,THE PURPLE GRASSES,countries to improve the color of the wine; so that the poetaster may
7035,THE PURPLE GRASSES,be celebrating the virtues of the poke without knowing it. Here are
7036,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"berries enough to paint afresh the western sky, and play the bacchanal"
7037,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"with, if you will. And what flutes its ensanguined stems would make,"
7038,THE PURPLE GRASSES,to be used in such a dance! It is truly a royal plant. I could spend
7039,THE PURPLE GRASSES,the evening of the year musing amid the poke stems. And perchance amid
7040,THE PURPLE GRASSES,these groves might arise at last a new school of philosophy or poetry.
7041,THE PURPLE GRASSES,It lasts all through September.
7042,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7043,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"At the same time with this, or near the end of August, a to me very"
7044,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"interesting genus of grasses, andropogons, or beard-grasses, is in its"
7045,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"prime: _Andropogon furcatus_, forked beard-grass, or call it"
7046,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"purple-fingered grass; _Andropogon scoparius_, purple wood-grass; and"
7047,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"_Andropogon_ (now called _Sorghum_) _nutans_, Indian-grass. The first"
7048,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"is a very tall and slender-culmed grass, three to seven feet high,"
7049,THE PURPLE GRASSES,with four or five purple finger-like spikes raying upward from the
7050,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"top. The second is also quite slender, growing in tufts two feet high"
7051,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"by one wide, with culms often somewhat curving, which, as the spikes"
7052,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"go out of bloom, have a whitish, fuzzy look. These two are prevailing"
7053,THE PURPLE GRASSES,grasses at this season on dry and sandy fields and hillsides. The
7054,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"culms of both, not to mention their pretty flowers, reflect a purple"
7055,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"tinge, and help to declare the ripeness of the year. Perhaps I have"
7056,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"the more sympathy with them because they are despised by the farmer,"
7057,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"and occupy sterile and neglected soil. They are high-colored, like"
7058,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"ripe grapes, and express a maturity which the spring did not suggest."
7059,THE PURPLE GRASSES,Only the August sun could have thus burnished these culms and leaves.
7060,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"The farmer has long since done his upland haying, and he will not"
7061,THE PURPLE GRASSES,condescend to bring his scythe to where these slender wild grasses
7062,THE PURPLE GRASSES,have at length flowered thinly; you often see spaces of bare sand amid
7063,THE PURPLE GRASSES,them. But I walk encouraged between the tufts of purple wood-grass
7064,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"over the sandy fields, and along the edge of the shrub oaks, glad to"
7065,THE PURPLE GRASSES,recognize these simple contemporaries. With thoughts cutting a broad
7066,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"swathe I ""get"" them, with horse-raking thoughts I gather them into"
7067,THE PURPLE GRASSES,windrows. The fine-eared poet may hear the whetting of my scythe.
7068,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"These two were almost the first grasses that I learned to distinguish,"
7069,THE PURPLE GRASSES,for I had not known by how many friends I was surrounded; I had seen
7070,THE PURPLE GRASSES,them simply as grasses standing. The purple of their culms also
7071,THE PURPLE GRASSES,excites me like that of the poke-weed stems.
7072,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7073,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"Think what refuge there is for one, before August is over, from"
7074,THE PURPLE GRASSES,college commencements and society that isolates! I can skulk amid the
7075,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"tufts of purple wood-grass on the borders of the ""Great Fields."""
7076,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"Wherever I walk these afternoons, the purple-fingered grass also"
7077,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"stands like a guide-board, and points my thoughts to more poetic paths"
7078,THE PURPLE GRASSES,than they have lately traveled.
7079,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7080,THE PURPLE GRASSES,A man shall perhaps rush by and trample down plants as high as his
7081,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"head, and cannot be said to know that they exist, though he may have"
7082,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"cut many tons of them, littered his stables with them, and fed them to"
7083,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"his cattle for years. Yet, if he ever favorably attends to them, he"
7084,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"may be overcome by their beauty. Each humblest plant, or weed, as we"
7085,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"call it, stands there to express some thought or mood of ours; and yet"
7086,THE PURPLE GRASSES,how long it stands in vain! I had walked over those Great Fields so
7087,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"many Augusts, and never yet distinctly recognized these purple"
7088,THE PURPLE GRASSES,companions that I had there. I had brushed against them and trodden on
7089,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"them, forsooth; and now, at last, they, as it were, rose up and"
7090,THE PURPLE GRASSES,blessed me. Beauty and true wealth are always thus cheap and despised.
7091,THE PURPLE GRASSES,Heaven might be defined as the place which men avoid. Who can doubt
7092,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"that these grasses, which the farmer says are of no account to him,"
7093,THE PURPLE GRASSES,find some compensation in your appreciation of them? I may say that I
7094,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"never saw them before; though, when I came to look them face to face,"
7095,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"there did come down to me a purple gleam from previous years; and now,"
7096,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"wherever I go, I see hardly anything else. It is the reign and"
7097,THE PURPLE GRASSES,presidency of the andropogons.
7098,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7099,THE PURPLE GRASSES,Almost the very sands confess the ripening influence of the August
7100,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"sun, and methinks, together with the slender grasses waving over them,"
7101,THE PURPLE GRASSES,reflect a purple tinge. The impurpled sands! Such is the consequence
7102,THE PURPLE GRASSES,of all this sunshine absorbed into the pores of plants and of the
7103,THE PURPLE GRASSES,earth. All sap or blood is now wine-colored. At last we have not only
7104,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"the purple sea, but the purple land."
7105,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7106,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"The chestnut beard-grass, Indian-grass, or wood-grass, growing here"
7107,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"and there in waste places, but more rare than the former (from two to"
7108,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"four or five feet high), is still handsomer and of more vivid colors"
7109,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"than its congeners, and might well have caught the Indian's eye. It"
7110,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"has a long, narrow, one-sided, and slightly nodding panicle of bright"
7111,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"purple and yellow flowers, like a banner raised above its reedy"
7112,THE PURPLE GRASSES,leaves. These bright standards are now advanced on the distant
7113,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"hillsides, not in large armies, but in scattered troops or single"
7114,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"file, like the red men. They stand thus fair and bright,"
7115,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"representative of the race which they are named after, but for the"
7116,THE PURPLE GRASSES,most part unobserved as they. The expression of this grass haunted me
7117,THE PURPLE GRASSES,"for a week, after I first passed and noticed it, like the glance of an"
7118,THE PURPLE GRASSES,eye. It stands like an Indian chief taking a last look at his favorite
7119,THE PURPLE GRASSES,hunting-grounds.
7120,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7121,THE PURPLE GRASSES,
7122,THE RED MAPLE,THE RED MAPLE
7123,THE RED MAPLE,
7124,THE RED MAPLE,"By the twenty-fifth of September, the red maples generally are"
7125,THE RED MAPLE,beginning to be ripe. Some large ones have been conspicuously changing
7126,THE RED MAPLE,"for a week, and some single trees are now very brilliant. I notice a"
7127,THE RED MAPLE,"small one, half a mile off across a meadow, against the green woodside"
7128,THE RED MAPLE,"there, a far brighter red than the blossoms of any tree in summer,"
7129,THE RED MAPLE,and more conspicuous. I have observed this tree for several autumns
7130,THE RED MAPLE,"invariably changing earlier than its fellows, just as one tree ripens"
7131,THE RED MAPLE,"its fruit earlier than another. It might serve to mark the season,"
7132,THE RED MAPLE,perhaps. I should be sorry if it were cut down. I know of two or three
7133,THE RED MAPLE,"such trees in different parts of our town, which might, perhaps, be"
7134,THE RED MAPLE,"propagated from, as early ripeners or September trees, and their seed"
7135,THE RED MAPLE,"be advertised in the market, as well as that of radishes, if we cared"
7136,THE RED MAPLE,as much about them.
7137,THE RED MAPLE,
7138,THE RED MAPLE,At present these burning bushes stand chiefly along the edge of the
7139,THE RED MAPLE,"meadows, or I distinguish them afar on the hillsides here and there."
7140,THE RED MAPLE,Sometimes you will see many small ones in a swamp turned quite crimson
7141,THE RED MAPLE,"when all other trees around are still perfectly green, and the former"
7142,THE RED MAPLE,"appear so much the brighter for it. They take you by surprise, as you"
7143,THE RED MAPLE,"are going by on one side, across the fields, thus early in the season,"
7144,THE RED MAPLE,"as if it were some gay encampment of the red men, or other foresters,"
7145,THE RED MAPLE,of whose arrival you had not heard.
7146,THE RED MAPLE,
7147,THE RED MAPLE,"Some single trees, wholly bright scarlet, seen against others of their"
7148,THE RED MAPLE,"kind still freshly green, or against evergreens, are more memorable"
7149,THE RED MAPLE,"than whole groves will be by and by. How beautiful, when a whole tree"
7150,THE RED MAPLE,"is like one great scarlet fruit full of ripe juices, every leaf, from"
7151,THE RED MAPLE,"lowest limb to topmost spire, all aglow, especially if you look toward"
7152,THE RED MAPLE,the sun! What more remarkable object can there be in the landscape?
7153,THE RED MAPLE,"Visible for miles, too fair to be believed. If such a phenomenon"
7154,THE RED MAPLE,"occurred but once, it would be handed down by tradition to posterity,"
7155,THE RED MAPLE,and get into the mythology at last.
7156,THE RED MAPLE,
7157,THE RED MAPLE,The whole tree thus ripening in advance of its fellows attains a
7158,THE RED MAPLE,"singular preëminence, and sometimes maintains it for a week or two. I"
7159,THE RED MAPLE,"am thrilled at the sight of it, bearing aloft its scarlet standard for"
7160,THE RED MAPLE,"the regiment of green-clad foresters around, and I go half a mile out"
7161,THE RED MAPLE,of my way to examine it. A single tree becomes thus the crowning
7162,THE RED MAPLE,"beauty of some meadowy vale, and the expression of the whole"
7163,THE RED MAPLE,surrounding forest is at once more spirited for it.
7164,THE RED MAPLE,
7165,THE RED MAPLE,"A small red maple has grown, perchance, far away at the head of some"
7166,THE RED MAPLE,"retired valley, a mile from any road, unobserved. It has faithfully"
7167,THE RED MAPLE,"discharged the duties of a maple there, all winter and summer,"
7168,THE RED MAPLE,"neglected none of its economies, but added to its stature in the"
7169,THE RED MAPLE,"virtue which belongs to a maple, by a steady growth for so many"
7170,THE RED MAPLE,"months, never having gone gadding abroad, and is nearer heaven than it"
7171,THE RED MAPLE,"was in the spring. It has faithfully husbanded its sap, and afforded a"
7172,THE RED MAPLE,"shelter to the wandering bird, has long since ripened its seeds and"
7173,THE RED MAPLE,"committed them to the winds, and has the satisfaction of knowing,"
7174,THE RED MAPLE,"perhaps, that a thousand little well-behaved maples are already"
7175,THE RED MAPLE,settled in life somewhere. It deserves well of Mapledom. Its leaves
7176,THE RED MAPLE,"have been asking it from time to time, in a whisper, ""When shall we"
7177,THE RED MAPLE,"redden?"" And now, in this month of September, this month of traveling,"
7178,THE RED MAPLE,"when men are hastening to the seaside, or the mountains, or the lakes,"
7179,THE RED MAPLE,"this modest maple, still without budging an inch, travels in its"
7180,THE RED MAPLE,"reputation,--runs up its scarlet flag on that hillside, which shows"
7181,THE RED MAPLE,"that it has finished its summer's work before all other trees, and"
7182,THE RED MAPLE,"withdraws from the contest. At the eleventh hour of the year, the"
7183,THE RED MAPLE,tree which no scrutiny could have detected here when it was most
7184,THE RED MAPLE,"industrious is thus, by the tint of its maturity, by its very blushes,"
7185,THE RED MAPLE,"revealed at last to the careless and distant traveler, and leads his"
7186,THE RED MAPLE,thoughts away from the dusty road into those brave solitudes which it
7187,THE RED MAPLE,inhabits. It flashes out conspicuous with all the virtue and beauty of
7188,THE RED MAPLE,"a maple,--_Acer rubrum_. We may now read its title, or _rubric_,"
7189,THE RED MAPLE,"clear. Its _virtues_, not its sins, are as scarlet."
7190,THE RED MAPLE,
7191,THE RED MAPLE,Notwithstanding the red maple is the most intense scarlet of any of
7192,THE RED MAPLE,"our trees, the sugar maple has been the most celebrated, and Michaux"
7193,THE RED MAPLE,"in his ""Sylva"" does not speak of the autumnal color of the former."
7194,THE RED MAPLE,"About the second of October, these trees, both large and small, are"
7195,THE RED MAPLE,"most brilliant, though many are still green. In ""sprout-lands"" they"
7196,THE RED MAPLE,"seem to vie with one another, and ever some particular one in the"
7197,THE RED MAPLE,"midst of the crowd will be of a peculiarly pure scarlet, and by its"
7198,THE RED MAPLE,"more intense color attract our eye even at a distance, and carry off"
7199,THE RED MAPLE,"the palm. A large red maple swamp, when at the height of its change,"
7200,THE RED MAPLE,"is the most obviously brilliant of all tangible things, where I dwell,"
7201,THE RED MAPLE,so abundant is this tree with us. It varies much both in form and
7202,THE RED MAPLE,"color. A great many are merely yellow; more, scarlet; others, scarlet"
7203,THE RED MAPLE,"deepening into crimson, more red than common. Look at yonder swamp of"
7204,THE RED MAPLE,"maples mixed with pines, at the base of a pine-clad hill, a quarter of"
7205,THE RED MAPLE,"a mile off, so that you get the full effect of the bright colors,"
7206,THE RED MAPLE,"without detecting the imperfections of the leaves, and see their"
7207,THE RED MAPLE,"yellow, scarlet, and crimson fires, of all tints, mingled and"
7208,THE RED MAPLE,"contrasted with the green. Some maples are yet green, only yellow or"
7209,THE RED MAPLE,"crimson-tipped on the edges of their flakes, like the edges of a"
7210,THE RED MAPLE,"hazelnut bur; some are wholly brilliant scarlet, raying out regularly"
7211,THE RED MAPLE,"and finely every way, bilaterally, like the veins of a leaf; others,"
7212,THE RED MAPLE,"of more irregular form, when I turn my head slightly, emptying out"
7213,THE RED MAPLE,"some of its earthiness and concealing the trunk of the tree, seem to"
7214,THE RED MAPLE,"rest heavily flake on flake, like yellow and scarlet clouds, wreath"
7215,THE RED MAPLE,"upon wreath, or like snow-drifts driving through the air, stratified"
7216,THE RED MAPLE,by the wind. It adds greatly to the beauty of such a swamp at this
7217,THE RED MAPLE,"season, that, even though there may be no other trees interspersed, it"
7218,THE RED MAPLE,"is not seen as a simple mass of color, but, different trees being of"
7219,THE RED MAPLE,"different colors and hues, the outline of each crescent treetop is"
7220,THE RED MAPLE,"distinct, and where one laps on to another. Yet a painter would hardly"
7221,THE RED MAPLE,venture to make them thus distinct a quarter of a mile off.
7222,THE RED MAPLE,
7223,THE RED MAPLE,As I go across a meadow directly toward a low rising ground this
7224,THE RED MAPLE,"bright afternoon, I see, some fifty rods off toward the sun, the top"
7225,THE RED MAPLE,of a maple swamp just appearing over the sheeny russet edge of the
7226,THE RED MAPLE,"hill, a stripe apparently twenty rods long by ten feet deep, of the"
7227,THE RED MAPLE,"most intensely brilliant scarlet, orange, and yellow, equal to any"
7228,THE RED MAPLE,"flowers or fruits, or any tints ever painted. As I advance, lowering"
7229,THE RED MAPLE,the edge of the hill which makes the firm foreground or lower frame of
7230,THE RED MAPLE,"the picture, the depth of the brilliant grove revealed steadily"
7231,THE RED MAPLE,"increases, suggesting that the whole of the inclosed valley is filled"
7232,THE RED MAPLE,with such color. One wonders that the tithing-men and fathers of the
7233,THE RED MAPLE,town are not out to see what the trees mean by their high colors and
7234,THE RED MAPLE,"exuberance of spirits, fearing that some mischief is brewing. I do not"
7235,THE RED MAPLE,"see what the Puritans did at this season, when the maples blaze out in"
7236,THE RED MAPLE,scarlet. They certainly could not have worshiped in groves then.
7237,THE RED MAPLE,Perhaps that is what they built meeting-houses and fenced them round
7238,THE RED MAPLE,with horse-sheds for.
7239,THE RED MAPLE,
7240,THE RED MAPLE,
7241,THE ELM,THE ELM
7242,THE ELM,
7243,THE ELM,"Now too, the first of October, or later, the elms are at the height of"
7244,THE ELM,"their autumnal beauty,--great brownish-yellow masses, warm from their"
7245,THE ELM,"September oven, hanging over the highway. Their leaves are perfectly"
7246,THE ELM,ripe. I wonder if there is any answering ripeness in the lives of the
7247,THE ELM,"men who live beneath them. As I look down our street, which is lined"
7248,THE ELM,"with them, they remind me both by their form and color of yellowing"
7249,THE ELM,"sheaves of grain, as if the harvest had indeed come to the village"
7250,THE ELM,"itself, and we might expect to find some maturity and _flavor_ in the"
7251,THE ELM,thoughts of the villagers at last. Under those bright rustling yellow
7252,THE ELM,"piles just ready to fall on the heads of the walkers, how can any"
7253,THE ELM,crudity or greenness of thought or act prevail? When I stand where
7254,THE ELM,"half a dozen large elms droop over a house, it is as if I stood within"
7255,THE ELM,"a ripe pumpkin-rind, and I feel as mellow as if I were the pulp,"
7256,THE ELM,though I may be somewhat stringy and seedy withal. What is the late
7257,THE ELM,"greenness of the English elm, like a cucumber out of season, which"
7258,THE ELM,"does not know when to have done, compared with the early and golden"
7259,THE ELM,maturity of the American tree? The street is the scene of a great
7260,THE ELM,"harvest-home. It would be worth the while to set out these trees, if"
7261,THE ELM,only for their autumnal value. Think of these great yellow canopies
7262,THE ELM,"or parasols held over our heads and houses by the mile together,"
7263,THE ELM,"making the village all one and compact,--an _ulmarium_, which is at"
7264,THE ELM,the same time a nursery of men! And then how gently and unobserved
7265,THE ELM,"they drop their burden and let in the sun when it is wanted, their"
7266,THE ELM,leaves not heard when they fall on our roofs and in our streets; and
7267,THE ELM,thus the village parasol is shut up and put away! I see the market-man
7268,THE ELM,"driving into the village, and disappearing under its canopy of"
7269,THE ELM,"elm-tops, with _his_ crop, as into a great granary or barn-yard. I am"
7270,THE ELM,"tempted to go thither as to a husking of thoughts, now dry and ripe,"
7271,THE ELM,"and ready to be separated from their integuments; but, alas! I foresee"
7272,THE ELM,"that it will be chiefly husks and little thought, blasted pig-corn,"
7273,THE ELM,"fit only for cob-meal,--for, as you sow, so shall you reap."
7274,THE ELM,
7275,THE ELM,
7276,FALLEN LEAVES,FALLEN LEAVES
7277,FALLEN LEAVES,
7278,FALLEN LEAVES,"By the sixth of October the leaves generally begin to fall, in"
7279,FALLEN LEAVES,"successive showers, after frost or rain; but the principal"
7280,FALLEN LEAVES,"leaf-harvest, the acme of the _Fall_, is commonly about the sixteenth."
7281,FALLEN LEAVES,Some morning at that date there is perhaps a harder frost than we have
7282,FALLEN LEAVES,"seen, and ice formed under the pump, and now, when the morning wind"
7283,FALLEN LEAVES,"rises, the leaves come down in denser showers than ever. They suddenly"
7284,FALLEN LEAVES,"form thick beds or carpets on the ground, in this gentle air, or even"
7285,FALLEN LEAVES,"without wind, just the size and form of the tree above. Some trees, as"
7286,FALLEN LEAVES,"small hickories, appear to have dropped their leaves instantaneously,"
7287,FALLEN LEAVES,"as a soldier grounds arms at a signal; and those of the hickory,"
7288,FALLEN LEAVES,"being bright yellow still, though withered, reflect a blaze of light"
7289,FALLEN LEAVES,"from the ground where they lie. Down they have come on all sides, at"
7290,FALLEN LEAVES,"the first earnest touch of autumn's wand, making a sound like rain."
7291,FALLEN LEAVES,
7292,FALLEN LEAVES,Or else it is after moist and rainy weather that we notice how great a
7293,FALLEN LEAVES,"fall of leaves there has been in the night, though it may not yet be"
7294,FALLEN LEAVES,the touch that loosens the rock maple leaf. The streets are thickly
7295,FALLEN LEAVES,"strewn with the trophies, and fallen elm leaves make a dark brown"
7296,FALLEN LEAVES,pavement under our feet. After some remarkably warm Indian-summer day
7297,FALLEN LEAVES,"or days, I perceive that it is the unusual heat which, more than"
7298,FALLEN LEAVES,"anything, causes the leaves to fall, there having been, perhaps, no"
7299,FALLEN LEAVES,frost nor rain for some time. The intense heat suddenly ripens and
7300,FALLEN LEAVES,"wilts them, just as it softens and ripens peaches and other fruits,"
7301,FALLEN LEAVES,and causes them to drop.
7302,FALLEN LEAVES,
7303,FALLEN LEAVES,"The leaves of late red maples, still bright, strew the earth, often"
7304,FALLEN LEAVES,"crimson-spotted on a yellow ground, like some wild apples,--though"
7305,FALLEN LEAVES,"they preserve these bright colors on the ground but a day or two,"
7306,FALLEN LEAVES,especially if it rains. On causeways I go by trees here and there all
7307,FALLEN LEAVES,"bare and smoke-like, having lost their brilliant clothing; but there"
7308,FALLEN LEAVES,"it lies, nearly as bright as ever, on the ground on one side, and"
7309,FALLEN LEAVES,making nearly as regular a figure as lately on the tree. I would
7310,FALLEN LEAVES,rather say that I first observe the trees thus flat on the ground like
7311,FALLEN LEAVES,"a permanent colored shadow, and they suggest to look for the boughs"
7312,FALLEN LEAVES,that bore them. A queen might be proud to walk where these gallant
7313,FALLEN LEAVES,trees have spread their bright cloaks in the mud. I see wagons roll
7314,FALLEN LEAVES,"over them as a shadow or a reflection, and the drivers heed them just"
7315,FALLEN LEAVES,as little as they did their shadows before.
7316,FALLEN LEAVES,
7317,FALLEN LEAVES,"Birds' nests, in the huckleberry and other shrubs, and in trees, are"
7318,FALLEN LEAVES,already being filled with the withered leaves. So many have fallen in
7319,FALLEN LEAVES,the woods that a squirrel cannot run after a falling nut without being
7320,FALLEN LEAVES,"heard. Boys are raking them in the streets, if only for the pleasure"
7321,FALLEN LEAVES,"of dealing with such clean, crisp substances. Some sweep the paths"
7322,FALLEN LEAVES,"scrupulously neat, and then stand to see the next breath strew them"
7323,FALLEN LEAVES,"with new trophies. The swamp floor is thickly covered, and the"
7324,FALLEN LEAVES,_Lycopodium lucidulum_ looks suddenly greener amid them. In dense
7325,FALLEN LEAVES,woods they half cover pools that are three or four rods long. The
7326,FALLEN LEAVES,"other day I could hardly find a well-known spring, and even suspected"
7327,FALLEN LEAVES,"that it had dried up, for it was completely concealed by freshly"
7328,FALLEN LEAVES,"fallen leaves; and when I swept them aside and revealed it, it was"
7329,FALLEN LEAVES,"like striking the earth, with Aaron's rod, for a new spring. Wet"
7330,FALLEN LEAVES,"grounds about the edges of swamps look dry with them. At one swamp,"
7331,FALLEN LEAVES,"where I was surveying, thinking to step on a leafy shore from a rail,"
7332,FALLEN LEAVES,I got into the water more than a foot deep.
7333,FALLEN LEAVES,
7334,FALLEN LEAVES,"When I go to the river the day after the principal fall of leaves, the"
7335,FALLEN LEAVES,"sixteenth, I find my boat all covered, bottom and seats, with the"
7336,FALLEN LEAVES,"leaves of the golden willow under which it is moored, and I set sail"
7337,FALLEN LEAVES,"with a cargo of them rustling under my feet. If I empty it, it will be"
7338,FALLEN LEAVES,"full again to-morrow. I do not regard them as litter, to be swept out,"
7339,FALLEN LEAVES,but accept them as suitable straw or matting for the bottom of my
7340,FALLEN LEAVES,"carriage. When I turn up into the mouth of the Assabet, which is"
7341,FALLEN LEAVES,"wooded, large fleets of leaves are floating on its surface, as it"
7342,FALLEN LEAVES,"were getting out to sea, with room to tack; but next the shore, a"
7343,FALLEN LEAVES,"little farther up, they are thicker than foam, quite concealing the"
7344,FALLEN LEAVES,"water for a rod in width, under and amid the alders, button-bushes,"
7345,FALLEN LEAVES,"and maples, still perfectly light and dry, with fibre unrelaxed; and"
7346,FALLEN LEAVES,"at a rocky bend where they are met and stopped by the morning wind,"
7347,FALLEN LEAVES,they sometimes form a broad and dense crescent quite across the river.
7348,FALLEN LEAVES,"When I turn my prow that way, and the wave which it makes strikes"
7349,FALLEN LEAVES,"them, list what a pleasant rustling from these dry substances getting"
7350,FALLEN LEAVES,on one another! Often it is their undulation only which reveals the
7351,FALLEN LEAVES,water beneath them. Also every motion of the wood turtle on the shore
7352,FALLEN LEAVES,"is betrayed by their rustling there. Or even in mid-channel, when the"
7353,FALLEN LEAVES,"wind rises, I hear them blown with a rustling sound. Higher up they"
7354,FALLEN LEAVES,are slowly moving round and round in some great eddy which the river
7355,FALLEN LEAVES,"makes, as that at the ""Leaning Hemlocks,"" where the water is deep, and"
7356,FALLEN LEAVES,the current is wearing into the bank.
7357,FALLEN LEAVES,
7358,FALLEN LEAVES,"Perchance, in the afternoon of such a day, when the water is perfectly"
7359,FALLEN LEAVES,"calm and full of reflections, I paddle gently down the main stream,"
7360,FALLEN LEAVES,"and, turning up the Assabet, reach a quiet cove, where I unexpectedly"
7361,FALLEN LEAVES,"find myself surrounded by myriads of leaves, like fellow-voyagers,"
7362,FALLEN LEAVES,"which seem to have the same purpose, or want of purpose, with myself."
7363,FALLEN LEAVES,"See this great fleet of scattered leaf-boats which we paddle amid, in"
7364,FALLEN LEAVES,"this smooth river-bay, each one curled up on every side by the sun's"
7365,FALLEN LEAVES,"skill, each nerve a stiff spruce knee,--like boats of hide, and of all"
7366,FALLEN LEAVES,"patterns,--Charon's boat probably among the rest,--and some with"
7367,FALLEN LEAVES,"lofty prows and poops, like the stately vessels of the ancients,"
7368,FALLEN LEAVES,"scarcely moving in the sluggish current,--like the great fleets, the"
7369,FALLEN LEAVES,"dense Chinese cities of boats, with which you mingle on entering some"
7370,FALLEN LEAVES,"great mart, some New York or Canton, which we are all steadily"
7371,FALLEN LEAVES,approaching together. How gently each has been deposited on the water!
7372,FALLEN LEAVES,"No violence has been used towards them yet, though, perchance,"
7373,FALLEN LEAVES,"palpitating hearts were present at the launching. And painted ducks,"
7374,FALLEN LEAVES,"too, the splendid wood duck among the rest, often come to sail and"
7375,FALLEN LEAVES,"float amid the painted leaves,--barks of a nobler model still!"
7376,FALLEN LEAVES,
7377,FALLEN LEAVES,What wholesome herb drinks are to be had in the swamps now! What
7378,FALLEN LEAVES,strong medicinal but rich scents from the decaying leaves! The rain
7379,FALLEN LEAVES,"falling on the freshly dried herbs and leaves, and filling the pools"
7380,FALLEN LEAVES,"and ditches into which they have dropped thus clean and rigid, will"
7381,FALLEN LEAVES,"soon convert them into tea,--green, black, brown, and yellow teas, of"
7382,FALLEN LEAVES,"all degrees of strength, enough to set all Nature a-gossiping. Whether"
7383,FALLEN LEAVES,"we drink them or not, as yet, before their strength is drawn, these"
7384,FALLEN LEAVES,"leaves, dried on great Nature's coppers, are of such various pure and"
7385,FALLEN LEAVES,delicate tints as might make the fame of Oriental teas.
7386,FALLEN LEAVES,
7387,FALLEN LEAVES,"How they are mixed up, of all species, oak and maple and chestnut and"
7388,FALLEN LEAVES,birch! But Nature is not cluttered with them; she is a perfect
7389,FALLEN LEAVES,husbandman; she stores them all. Consider what a vast crop is thus
7390,FALLEN LEAVES,"annually shed on the earth! This, more than any mere grain or seed, is"
7391,FALLEN LEAVES,the great harvest of the year. The trees are now repaying the earth
7392,FALLEN LEAVES,with interest what they have taken from it. They are discounting.
7393,FALLEN LEAVES,They are about to add a leaf's thickness to the depth of the soil.
7394,FALLEN LEAVES,"This is the beautiful way in which Nature gets her muck, while I"
7395,FALLEN LEAVES,"chaffer with this man and that, who talks to me about sulphur and the"
7396,FALLEN LEAVES,cost of carting. We are all the richer for their decay. I am more
7397,FALLEN LEAVES,interested in this crop than in the English grass alone or in the
7398,FALLEN LEAVES,"corn. It prepares the virgin mould for future corn-fields and forests,"
7399,FALLEN LEAVES,on which the earth fattens. It keeps our homestead in good heart.
7400,FALLEN LEAVES,
7401,FALLEN LEAVES,For beautiful variety no crop can be compared with this. Here is not
7402,FALLEN LEAVES,"merely the plain yellow of the grains, but nearly all the colors that"
7403,FALLEN LEAVES,"we know, the brightest blue not excepted: the early blushing maple,"
7404,FALLEN LEAVES,"the poison sumach blazing its sins as scarlet, the mulberry ash, the"
7405,FALLEN LEAVES,"rich chrome yellow of the poplars, the brilliant red huckleberry, with"
7406,FALLEN LEAVES,"which the hills' backs are painted, like those of sheep. The frost"
7407,FALLEN LEAVES,"touches them, and, with the slightest breath of returning day or"
7408,FALLEN LEAVES,"jarring of earth's axle, see in what showers they come floating down!"
7409,FALLEN LEAVES,The ground is all parti-colored with them. But they still live in the
7410,FALLEN LEAVES,"soil, whose fertility and bulk they increase, and in the forests that"
7411,FALLEN LEAVES,"spring from it. They stoop to rise, to mount higher in coming years,"
7412,FALLEN LEAVES,"by subtle chemistry, climbing by the sap in the trees; and the"
7413,FALLEN LEAVES,"sapling's first fruits thus shed, transmuted at last, may adorn its"
7414,FALLEN LEAVES,"crown, when, in after years, it has become the monarch of the forest."
7415,FALLEN LEAVES,
7416,FALLEN LEAVES,"It is pleasant to walk over the beds of these fresh, crisp, and"
7417,FALLEN LEAVES,rustling leaves. How beautifully they go to their graves! how gently
7418,FALLEN LEAVES,"lay themselves down and turn to mould!--painted of a thousand hues,"
7419,FALLEN LEAVES,and fit to make the beds of us living. So they troop to their last
7420,FALLEN LEAVES,"resting-place, light and frisky. They put on no weeds, but merrily"
7421,FALLEN LEAVES,"they go scampering over the earth, selecting the spot, choosing a lot,"
7422,FALLEN LEAVES,"ordering no iron fence, whispering all through the woods about"
7423,FALLEN LEAVES,"it,--some choosing the spot where the bodies of men are mouldering"
7424,FALLEN LEAVES,"beneath, and meeting them half-way. How many flutterings before they"
7425,FALLEN LEAVES,"rest quietly in their graves! They that soared so loftily, how"
7426,FALLEN LEAVES,"contentedly they return to dust again, and are laid low, resigned to"
7427,FALLEN LEAVES,"lie and decay at the foot of the tree, and afford nourishment to new"
7428,FALLEN LEAVES,"generations of their kind, as well as to flutter on high! They teach"
7429,FALLEN LEAVES,"us how to die. One wonders if the time will ever come when men, with"
7430,FALLEN LEAVES,"their boasted faith in immortality, will lie down as gracefully and as"
7431,FALLEN LEAVES,"ripe,--with such an Indian-summer serenity will shed their bodies, as"
7432,FALLEN LEAVES,they do their hair and nails.
7433,FALLEN LEAVES,
7434,FALLEN LEAVES,"When the leaves fall, the whole earth is a cemetery pleasant to walk"
7435,FALLEN LEAVES,in. I love to wander and muse over them in their graves. Here are no
7436,FALLEN LEAVES,lying nor vain epitaphs. What though you own no lot at Mount Auburn?
7437,FALLEN LEAVES,"Your lot is surely cast somewhere in this vast cemetery, which has"
7438,FALLEN LEAVES,been consecrated from of old. You need attend no auction to secure a
7439,FALLEN LEAVES,place. There is room enough here. The loosestrife shall bloom and the
7440,FALLEN LEAVES,huckleberry-bird sing over your bones. The woodman and hunter shall be
7441,FALLEN LEAVES,"your sextons, and the children shall tread upon the borders as much as"
7442,FALLEN LEAVES,they will. Let us walk in the cemetery of the leaves; this is your
7443,FALLEN LEAVES,true Greenwood Cemetery.

7448,THE SUGAR MAPLE,THE SUGAR MAPLE
7449,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7450,THE SUGAR MAPLE,But think not that the splendor of the year is over; for as one leaf
7451,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"does not make a summer, neither does one falling leaf make an autumn."
7452,THE SUGAR MAPLE,The smallest sugar maples in our streets make a great show as early as
7453,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the fifth of October, more than any other trees there. As I look up"
7454,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the main street, they appear like painted screens standing before the"
7455,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"houses; yet many are green. But now, or generally by the seventeenth"
7456,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"of October, when almost all red maples and some white maples are bare,"
7457,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the large sugar maples also are in their glory, glowing with yellow"
7458,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"and red, and show unexpectedly bright and delicate tints. They are"
7459,THE SUGAR MAPLE,remarkable for the contrast they often afford of deep blushing red on
7460,THE SUGAR MAPLE,one half and green on the other. They become at length dense masses of
7461,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"rich yellow with a deep scarlet blush, or more than blush, on the"
7462,THE SUGAR MAPLE,exposed surfaces. They are the brightest trees now in the street.
7463,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7464,THE SUGAR MAPLE,The large ones on our Common are particularly beautiful. A delicate
7465,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"but warmer than golden yellow is now the prevailing color, with"
7466,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"scarlet cheeks. Yet, standing on the east side of the Common just"
7467,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"before sundown, when the western light is transmitted through them, I"
7468,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"see that their yellow even, compared with the pale lemon yellow of an"
7469,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"elm close by, amounts to a scarlet, without noticing the bright"
7470,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"scarlet portions. Generally, they are great regular oval masses of"
7471,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"yellow and scarlet. All the sunny warmth of the season, the Indian"
7472,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"summer, seems to be absorbed in their leaves. The lowest and inmost"
7473,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"leaves next the bole are, as usual, of the most delicate yellow and"
7474,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"green, like the complexion of young men brought up in the house. There"
7475,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"is an auction on the Common to-day, but its red flag is hard to be"
7476,THE SUGAR MAPLE,discerned amid this blaze of color.
7477,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7478,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Little did the fathers of the town anticipate this brilliant success,"
7479,THE SUGAR MAPLE,when they caused to be imported from farther in the country some
7480,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"straight poles with their tops cut off, which they called sugar"
7481,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"maples; and, as I remember, after they were set out, a neighboring"
7482,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"merchant's clerk, by way of jest, planted beans about them. Those"
7483,THE SUGAR MAPLE,which were then jestingly called bean-poles are to-day far the most
7484,THE SUGAR MAPLE,beautiful objects noticeable in our streets. They are worth all and
7485,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"more than they have cost,--though one of the selectmen, while setting"
7486,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"them out, took the cold which occasioned his death,--if only because"
7487,THE SUGAR MAPLE,they have filled the open eyes of children with their rich color
7488,THE SUGAR MAPLE,unstintedly so many Octobers. We will not ask them to yield us sugar
7489,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"in the spring, while they afford us so fair a prospect in the autumn."
7490,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Wealth indoors may be the inheritance of few, but it is equally"
7491,THE SUGAR MAPLE,distributed on the Common. All children alike can revel in this golden
7492,THE SUGAR MAPLE,harvest.
7493,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7494,THE SUGAR MAPLE,Surely trees should be set in our streets with a view to their October
7495,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"splendor, though I doubt whether this is ever considered by the ""Tree"
7496,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Society."" Do you not think it will make some odds to these children"
7497,THE SUGAR MAPLE,that they were brought up under the maples? Hundreds of eyes are
7498,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"steadily drinking in this color, and by these teachers even the"
7499,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"truants are caught and educated the moment they step abroad. Indeed,"
7500,THE SUGAR MAPLE,neither the truant nor the studious is at present taught color in the
7501,THE SUGAR MAPLE,schools. These are instead of the bright colors in apothecaries'
7502,THE SUGAR MAPLE,shops and city windows. It is a pity that we have no more _red_
7503,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"maples, and some hickories, in our streets as well. Our paint-box is"
7504,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"very imperfectly filled. Instead of, or beside, supplying such"
7505,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"paint-boxes as we do, we might supply these natural colors to the"
7506,THE SUGAR MAPLE,young. Where else will they study color under greater advantages? What
7507,THE SUGAR MAPLE,School of Design can vie with this? Think how much the eyes of
7508,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"painters of all kinds, and of manufacturers of cloth and paper, and"
7509,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"paper-stainers, and countless others, are to be educated by these"
7510,THE SUGAR MAPLE,autumnal colors. The stationer's envelopes may be of very various
7511,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"tints, yet not so various as those of the leaves of a single tree. If"
7512,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"you want a different shade or tint of a particular color, you have"
7513,THE SUGAR MAPLE,only to look farther within or without the tree or the wood. These
7514,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"leaves are not many dipped in one dye, as at the dye-house, but they"
7515,THE SUGAR MAPLE,are dyed in light of infinitely various degrees of strength and left
7516,THE SUGAR MAPLE,to set and dry there.
7517,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7518,THE SUGAR MAPLE,Shall the names of so many of our colors continue to be derived from
7519,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"those of obscure foreign localities, as Naples yellow, Prussian blue,"
7520,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"raw Sienna, burnt Umber, Gamboge? (surely the Tyrian purple must have"
7521,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"faded by this time), or from comparatively trivial articles of"
7522,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"commerce,--chocolate, lemon, coffee, cinnamon, claret? (shall we"
7523,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"compare our hickory to a lemon, or a lemon to a hickory?) or from ores"
7524,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"and oxides which few ever see? Shall we so often, when describing to"
7525,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"our neighbors the color of something we have seen, refer them, not to"
7526,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"some natural object in our neighborhood, but perchance to a bit of"
7527,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"earth fetched from the other side of the planet, which possibly they"
7528,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"may find at the apothecary's, but which probably neither they nor we"
7529,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"ever saw? Have we not an _earth_ under our feet,--aye, and a sky over"
7530,THE SUGAR MAPLE,our heads? Or is the last _all_ ultramarine? What do we know of
7531,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"sapphire, amethyst, emerald, ruby, amber, and the like,--most of us"
7532,THE SUGAR MAPLE,who take these names in vain? Leave these precious words to
7533,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"cabinet-keepers, virtuosos, and maids-of-honor,--to the Nabobs,"
7534,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Begums, and Chobdars of Hindostan, or wherever else. I do not see why,"
7535,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"since America and her autumn woods have been discovered, our leaves"
7536,THE SUGAR MAPLE,should not compete with the precious stones in giving names to colors;
7537,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"and, indeed, I believe that in course of time the names of some of our"
7538,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"trees and shrubs, as well as flowers, will get into our popular"
7539,THE SUGAR MAPLE,chromatic nomenclature.
7540,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7541,THE SUGAR MAPLE,But of much more importance than a knowledge of the names and
7542,THE SUGAR MAPLE,distinctions of color is the joy and exhilaration which these colored
7543,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"leaves excite. Already these brilliant trees throughout the street,"
7544,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"without any more variety, are at least equal to an annual festival and"
7545,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"holiday, or a week of such. These are cheap and innocent gala-days,"
7546,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"celebrated by one and all without the aid of committees or marshals,"
7547,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"such a show as may safely be licensed, not attracting gamblers or"
7548,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"rum-sellers, not requiring any special police to keep the peace. And"
7549,THE SUGAR MAPLE,poor indeed must be that New England village's October which has not
7550,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the maple in its streets. This October festival costs no powder, nor"
7551,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"ringing of bells, but every tree is a living liberty-pole on which a"
7552,THE SUGAR MAPLE,thousand bright flags are waving.
7553,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7554,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"No wonder that we must have our annual cattle-show, and fall training,"
7555,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"and perhaps cornwallis, our September courts, and the like. Nature"
7556,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"herself holds her annual fair in October, not only in the streets, but"
7557,THE SUGAR MAPLE,in every hollow and on every hillside. When lately we looked into that
7558,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"red maple swamp all ablaze, where the trees were clothed in their"
7559,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"vestures of most dazzling tints, did it not suggest a thousand gypsies"
7560,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"beneath,--a race capable of wild delight,--or even the fabled fauns,"
7561,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"satyrs, and wood-nymphs come back to earth? Or was it only a"
7562,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"congregation of wearied woodchoppers, or of proprietors come to"
7563,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"inspect their lots, that we thought of? Or, earlier still, when we"
7564,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"paddled on the river through that fine-grained September air, did"
7565,THE SUGAR MAPLE,there not appear to be something new going on under the sparkling
7566,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"surface of the stream, a shaking of props, at least, so that we made"
7567,THE SUGAR MAPLE,haste in order to be up in time? Did not the rows of yellowing willows
7568,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"and button-bushes on each side seem like rows of booths, under which,"
7569,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"perhaps, some fluviatile egg-pop equally yellow was effervescing? Did"
7570,THE SUGAR MAPLE,not all these suggest that man's spirits should rise as high as
7571,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Nature's,--should hang out their flag, and the routine of his life be"
7572,THE SUGAR MAPLE,interrupted by an analogous expression of joy and hilarity?
7573,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7574,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"No annual training or muster of soldiery, no celebration with its"
7575,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"scarfs and banners, could import into the town a hundredth part of the"
7576,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"annual splendor of our October. We have only to set the trees, or let"
7577,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"them stand, and Nature will find the colored drapery,--flags of all"
7578,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"her nations, some of whose private signals hardly the botanist can"
7579,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"read,--while we walk under the triumphal arches of the elms. Leave it"
7580,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"to Nature to appoint the days, whether the same as in neighboring"
7581,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"States or not, and let the clergy read her proclamations, if they can"
7582,THE SUGAR MAPLE,understand them. Behold what a brilliant drapery is her woodbine flag!
7583,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"What public-spirited merchant, think you, has contributed this part of"
7584,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the show? There is no handsomer shingling and paint than this vine, at"
7585,THE SUGAR MAPLE,present covering a whole side of some houses. I do not believe that
7586,THE SUGAR MAPLE,the ivy _never sere_ is comparable to it. No wonder it has been
7587,THE SUGAR MAPLE,extensively introduced into London. Let us have a good many maples and
7588,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"hickories and scarlet oaks, then, I say. Blaze away! Shall that dirty"
7589,THE SUGAR MAPLE,roll of bunting in the gun-house be all the colors a village can
7590,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"display? A village is not complete, unless it have these trees to mark"
7591,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"the season in it. They are important, like the town clock. A village"
7592,THE SUGAR MAPLE,that has them not will not be found to work well. It has a screw
7593,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"loose, an essential part is wanting. Let us have willows for spring,"
7594,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"elms for summer, maples and walnuts and tupeloes for autumn,"
7595,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"evergreens for winter, and oaks for all seasons. What is a gallery in"
7596,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"a house to a gallery in the streets, which every market-man rides"
7597,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"through, whether he will or not? Of course, there is not a"
7598,THE SUGAR MAPLE,picture-gallery in the country which would be worth so much to us as
7599,THE SUGAR MAPLE,is the western view at sunset under the elms of our main street. They
7600,THE SUGAR MAPLE,are the frame to a picture which is daily painted behind them. An
7601,THE SUGAR MAPLE,avenue of elms as large as our largest and three miles long would seem
7602,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"to lead to some admirable place, though only C---- were at the end of"
7603,THE SUGAR MAPLE,it.
7604,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7605,THE SUGAR MAPLE,A village needs these innocent stimulants of bright and cheering
7606,THE SUGAR MAPLE,prospects to keep off melancholy and superstition. Show me two
7607,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"villages, one embowered in trees and blazing with all the glories of"
7608,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"October, the other a merely trivial and treeless waste, or with only a"
7609,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"single tree or two for suicides, and I shall be sure that in the"
7610,THE SUGAR MAPLE,latter will be found the most starved and bigoted religionists and the
7611,THE SUGAR MAPLE,most desperate drinkers. Every wash-tub and milk-can and gravestone
7612,THE SUGAR MAPLE,will be exposed. The inhabitants will disappear abruptly behind their
7613,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"barns and houses, like desert Arabs amid their rocks, and I shall look"
7614,THE SUGAR MAPLE,to see spears in their hands. They will be ready to accept the most
7615,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"barren and forlorn doctrine,--as that the world is speedily coming to"
7616,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"an end, or has already got to it, or that they themselves are turned"
7617,THE SUGAR MAPLE,wrong side outward. They will perchance crack their dry joints at one
7618,THE SUGAR MAPLE,another and call it a spiritual communication.
7619,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7620,THE SUGAR MAPLE,But to confine ourselves to the maples. What if we were to take half
7621,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"as much pains in protecting them as we do in setting them out,--not"
7622,THE SUGAR MAPLE,stupidly tie our horses to our dahlia stems?
7623,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7624,THE SUGAR MAPLE,What meant the fathers by establishing this _perfectly living_
7625,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"institution before the church,--this institution which needs no"
7626,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"repairing nor repainting, which is continually enlarged and repaired"
7627,THE SUGAR MAPLE,by its growth? Surely they
7628,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7629,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"""Wrought in a sad sincerity;"
7630,THE SUGAR MAPLE,Themselves from God they could not free;
7631,THE SUGAR MAPLE,They _planted_ better than they knew;--
7632,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"The conscious _trees_ to beauty grew."""
7633,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7634,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"Verily these maples are cheap preachers, permanently settled, which"
7635,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"preach their half-century, and century, aye, and century-and-a-half"
7636,THE SUGAR MAPLE,"sermons, with constantly increasing unction and influence, ministering"
7637,THE SUGAR MAPLE,to many generations of men; and the least we can do is to supply them
7638,THE SUGAR MAPLE,with suitable colleagues as they grow infirm.
7639,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7640,THE SUGAR MAPLE,
7641,THE SCARLET OAK,THE SCARLET OAK
7642,THE SCARLET OAK,
7643,THE SCARLET OAK,Belonging to a genus which is remarkable for the beautiful form of its
7644,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaves, I suspect that some scarlet oak leaves surpass those of all"
7645,THE SCARLET OAK,other oaks in the rich and wild beauty of their outlines. I judge from
7646,THE SCARLET OAK,"an acquaintance with twelve species, and from drawings which I have"
7647,THE SCARLET OAK,seen of many others.
7648,THE SCARLET OAK,
7649,THE SCARLET OAK,Stand under this tree and see how finely its leaves are cut against
7650,THE SCARLET OAK,"the sky,--as it were, only a few sharp points extending from a midrib."
7651,THE SCARLET OAK,"They look like double, treble, or quadruple crosses. They are far more"
7652,THE SCARLET OAK,ethereal than the less deeply scalloped oak leaves. They have so
7653,THE SCARLET OAK,"little leafy _terra firma_ that they appear melting away in the light,"
7654,THE SCARLET OAK,"and scarcely obstruct our view. The leaves of very young plants are,"
7655,THE SCARLET OAK,"like those of full-grown oaks of other species, more entire, simple,"
7656,THE SCARLET OAK,"and lumpish in their outlines, but these, raised high on old trees,"
7657,THE SCARLET OAK,"have solved the leafy problem. Lifted higher and higher, and"
7658,THE SCARLET OAK,"sublimated more and more, putting off some earthiness and cultivating"
7659,THE SCARLET OAK,"more intimacy with the light each year, they have at length the least"
7660,THE SCARLET OAK,"possible amount of earthy matter, and the greatest spread and grasp of"
7661,THE SCARLET OAK,"skyey influences. There they dance, arm in arm with the"
7662,THE SCARLET OAK,"light,--tripping it on fantastic points, fit partners in those aerial"
7663,THE SCARLET OAK,"halls. So intimately mingled are they with it, that, what with their"
7664,THE SCARLET OAK,"slenderness and their glossy surfaces, you can hardly tell at last"
7665,THE SCARLET OAK,"what in the dance is leaf and what is light. And when no zephyr stirs,"
7666,THE SCARLET OAK,they are at most but a rich tracery to the forest windows.
7667,THE SCARLET OAK,
7668,THE SCARLET OAK,"I am again struck with their beauty, when, a month later, they thickly"
7669,THE SCARLET OAK,"strew the ground in the woods, piled one upon another under my feet."
7670,THE SCARLET OAK,"They are then brown above, but purple beneath. With their narrow lobes"
7671,THE SCARLET OAK,"and their bold, deep scallops reaching almost to the middle, they"
7672,THE SCARLET OAK,"suggest that the material must be cheap, or else there has been a"
7673,THE SCARLET OAK,"lavish expense in their creation, as if so much had been cut out. Or"
7674,THE SCARLET OAK,else they seem to us the remnants of the stuff out of which leaves
7675,THE SCARLET OAK,"have been cut with a die. Indeed, when they lie thus one upon another,"
7676,THE SCARLET OAK,they remind me of a pile of scrap-tin.
7677,THE SCARLET OAK,
7678,THE SCARLET OAK,"Or bring one home, and study it closely at your leisure, by the"
7679,THE SCARLET OAK,"fireside. It is a type, not from any Oxford font, not in the Basque"
7680,THE SCARLET OAK,"nor the arrow-headed character, not found on the Rosetta Stone, but"
7681,THE SCARLET OAK,"destined to be copied in sculpture one day, if they ever get to"
7682,THE SCARLET OAK,"whittling stone here. What a wild and pleasing outline, a combination"
7683,THE SCARLET OAK,of graceful curves and angles! The eye rests with equal delight on
7684,THE SCARLET OAK,"what is not leaf and on what is leaf,--on the broad, free, open"
7685,THE SCARLET OAK,"sinuses, and on the long, sharp, bristle-pointed lobes. A simple oval"
7686,THE SCARLET OAK,"outline would include it all, if you connected the points of the leaf;"
7687,THE SCARLET OAK,"but how much richer is it than that, with its half-dozen deep"
7688,THE SCARLET OAK,"scallops, in which the eye and thought of the beholder are embayed! If"
7689,THE SCARLET OAK,"I were a drawing-master, I would set my pupils to copying these"
7690,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaves, that they might learn to draw firmly and gracefully."
7691,THE SCARLET OAK,
7692,THE SCARLET OAK,"Regarded as water, it is like a pond with half a dozen broad rounded"
7693,THE SCARLET OAK,"promontories extending nearly to its middle, half from each side,"
7694,THE SCARLET OAK,"while its watery bays extend far inland, like sharp friths, at each of"
7695,THE SCARLET OAK,"whose heads several fine streams empty in,--almost a leafy"
7696,THE SCARLET OAK,archipelago.
7697,THE SCARLET OAK,
7698,THE SCARLET OAK,"But it oftener suggests land, and, as Dionysius and Pliny compared the"
7699,THE SCARLET OAK,"form of the Morea to that of the leaf of the Oriental plane tree, so"
7700,THE SCARLET OAK,"this leaf reminds me of some fair wild island in the ocean, whose"
7701,THE SCARLET OAK,"extensive coast, alternate rounded bays with smooth strands, and"
7702,THE SCARLET OAK,"sharp-pointed rocky capes, mark it as fitted for the habitation of"
7703,THE SCARLET OAK,"man, and destined to become a centre of civilization at last. To the"
7704,THE SCARLET OAK,"sailor's eye, it is a much indented shore. Is it not, in fact, a shore"
7705,THE SCARLET OAK,"to the aerial ocean, on which the windy surf beats? At sight of this"
7706,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaf we are all mariners,--if not vikings, buccaneers, and"
7707,THE SCARLET OAK,filibusters. Both our love of repose and our spirit of adventure are
7708,THE SCARLET OAK,"addressed. In our most casual glance, perchance, we think that if we"
7709,THE SCARLET OAK,"succeed in doubling those sharp capes we shall find deep, smooth, and"
7710,THE SCARLET OAK,secure havens in the ample bays. How different from the white oak
7711,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaf, with its rounded headlands, on which no lighthouse need be"
7712,THE SCARLET OAK,"placed! That is an England, with its long civil history, that may be"
7713,THE SCARLET OAK,read. This is some still unsettled New-found Island or Celebes. Shall
7714,THE SCARLET OAK,we go and be rajahs there?
7715,THE SCARLET OAK,
7716,THE SCARLET OAK,By the twenty-sixth of October the large scarlet oaks are in their
7717,THE SCARLET OAK,"prime, when other oaks are usually withered. They have been kindling"
7718,THE SCARLET OAK,"their fires for a week past, and now generally burst into a blaze."
7719,THE SCARLET OAK,This alone of _our_ indigenous deciduous trees (excepting the
7720,THE SCARLET OAK,"dogwood, of which I do not know half a dozen, and they are but large"
7721,THE SCARLET OAK,bushes) is now in its glory. The two aspens and the sugar maple come
7722,THE SCARLET OAK,"nearest to it in date, but they have lost the greater part of their"
7723,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaves. Of evergreens, only the pitch pine is still commonly bright."
7724,THE SCARLET OAK,
7725,THE SCARLET OAK,"But it requires a particular alertness, if not devotion to these"
7726,THE SCARLET OAK,"phenomena, to appreciate the wide-spread, but late and unexpected"
7727,THE SCARLET OAK,glory of the scarlet oaks. I do not speak here of the small trees and
7728,THE SCARLET OAK,"shrubs, which are commonly observed, and which are now withered, but"
7729,THE SCARLET OAK,"of the large trees. Most go in and shut their doors, thinking that"
7730,THE SCARLET OAK,"bleak and colorless November has already come, when some of the most"
7731,THE SCARLET OAK,brilliant and memorable colors are not yet lit.
7732,THE SCARLET OAK,
7733,THE SCARLET OAK,"This very perfect and vigorous one, about forty feet high, standing in"
7734,THE SCARLET OAK,"an open pasture, which was quite glossy green on the twelfth, is now,"
7735,THE SCARLET OAK,"the twenty-sixth, completely changed to bright dark-scarlet,--every"
7736,THE SCARLET OAK,"leaf, between you and the sun, as if it had been dipped into a scarlet"
7737,THE SCARLET OAK,"dye. The whole tree is much like a heart in form, as well as color."
7738,THE SCARLET OAK,"Was not this worth waiting for? Little did you think, ten days ago,"
7739,THE SCARLET OAK,that that cold green tree would assume such color as this. Its leaves
7740,THE SCARLET OAK,"are still firmly attached, while those of other trees are falling"
7741,THE SCARLET OAK,"around it. It seems to say: ""I am the last to blush, but I blush"
7742,THE SCARLET OAK,deeper than any of ye. I bring up the rear in my red coat. We scarlet
7743,THE SCARLET OAK,"ones, alone of oaks, have not given up the fight."""
7744,THE SCARLET OAK,
7745,THE SCARLET OAK,"The sap is now, and even far into November, frequently flowing fast in"
7746,THE SCARLET OAK,"these trees, as in maples in the spring; and apparently their bright"
7747,THE SCARLET OAK,"tints, now that most other oaks are withered, are connected with this"
7748,THE SCARLET OAK,"phenomenon. They are full of life. It has a pleasantly astringent,"
7749,THE SCARLET OAK,"acorn-like taste, this strong oak wine, as I find on tapping them with"
7750,THE SCARLET OAK,my knife.
7751,THE SCARLET OAK,
7752,THE SCARLET OAK,"Looking across this woodland valley, a quarter of a mile wide, how"
7753,THE SCARLET OAK,"rich those scarlet oaks embosomed in pines, their bright red branches"
7754,THE SCARLET OAK,intimately intermingled with them! They have their full effect there.
7755,THE SCARLET OAK,"The pine boughs are the green calyx to their red petals. Or, as we go"
7756,THE SCARLET OAK,"along a road in the woods, the sun striking endwise through it, and"
7757,THE SCARLET OAK,"lighting up the red tents of the oaks, which on each side are mingled"
7758,THE SCARLET OAK,"with the liquid green of the pines, makes a very gorgeous scene."
7759,THE SCARLET OAK,"Indeed, without the evergreens for contrast, the autumnal tints would"
7760,THE SCARLET OAK,lose much of their effect.
7761,THE SCARLET OAK,
7762,THE SCARLET OAK,The scarlet oak asks a clear sky and the brightness of late October
7763,THE SCARLET OAK,days. These bring out its colors. If the sun goes into a cloud they
7764,THE SCARLET OAK,become comparatively indistinct. As I sit on a cliff in the southwest
7765,THE SCARLET OAK,"part of our town, the sun is now getting low, and the woods in"
7766,THE SCARLET OAK,"Lincoln, south and east of me, are lit up by its more level rays; and"
7767,THE SCARLET OAK,"in the scarlet oaks, scattered so equally over the forest, there is"
7768,THE SCARLET OAK,brought out a more brilliant redness than I had believed was in them.
7769,THE SCARLET OAK,"Every tree of this species which is visible in those directions, even"
7770,THE SCARLET OAK,"to the horizon, now stands out distinctly red. Some great ones lift"
7771,THE SCARLET OAK,"their red backs high above the woods, in the next town, like huge"
7772,THE SCARLET OAK,"roses with a myriad of fine petals; and some more slender ones, in a"
7773,THE SCARLET OAK,"small grove of white pines on Pine Hill in the east, on the very verge"
7774,THE SCARLET OAK,"of the horizon, alternating with the pines on the edge of the grove,"
7775,THE SCARLET OAK,"and shouldering them with their red coats, look like soldiers in red"
7776,THE SCARLET OAK,"amid hunters in green. This time it is Lincoln green, too. Till the"
7777,THE SCARLET OAK,"sun got low, I did not believe that there were so many redcoats in the"
7778,THE SCARLET OAK,"forest army. Theirs is an intense, burning red, which would lose some"
7779,THE SCARLET OAK,"of its strength, methinks, with every step you might take toward them;"
7780,THE SCARLET OAK,for the shade that lurks amid their foliage does not report itself at
7781,THE SCARLET OAK,"this distance, and they are unanimously red. The focus of their"
7782,THE SCARLET OAK,reflected color is in the atmosphere far on this side. Every such tree
7783,THE SCARLET OAK,"becomes a nucleus of red, as it were, where, with the declining sun,"
7784,THE SCARLET OAK,"that color grows and glows. It is partly borrowed fire, gathering"
7785,THE SCARLET OAK,strength from the sun on its way to your eye. It has only some
7786,THE SCARLET OAK,"comparatively dull red leaves for a rallying-point, or kindling-stuff,"
7787,THE SCARLET OAK,"to start it, and it becomes an intense scarlet or red mist, or fire,"
7788,THE SCARLET OAK,which finds fuel for itself in the very atmosphere. So vivacious is
7789,THE SCARLET OAK,redness. The very rails reflect a rosy light at this hour and season.
7790,THE SCARLET OAK,You see a redder tree than exists.
7791,THE SCARLET OAK,
7792,THE SCARLET OAK,"If you wish to count the scarlet oaks, do it now. In a clear day stand"
7793,THE SCARLET OAK,"thus on a hilltop in the woods, when the sun is an hour high, and"
7794,THE SCARLET OAK,"every one within range of your vision, excepting in the west, will be"
7795,THE SCARLET OAK,revealed. You might live to the age of Methuselah and never find a
7796,THE SCARLET OAK,"tithe of them, otherwise. Yet sometimes even in a dark day I have"
7797,THE SCARLET OAK,"thought them as bright as I ever saw them. Looking westward, their"
7798,THE SCARLET OAK,colors are lost in a blaze of light; but in other directions the whole
7799,THE SCARLET OAK,"forest is a flower-garden, in which these late roses burn, alternating"
7800,THE SCARLET OAK,"with green, while the so-called ""gardeners,"" walking here and there,"
7801,THE SCARLET OAK,"perchance, beneath, with spade and water-pot, see only a few little"
7802,THE SCARLET OAK,asters amid withered leaves.
7803,THE SCARLET OAK,
7804,THE SCARLET OAK,"These are _my_ China-asters, _my_ late garden-flowers. It costs me"
7805,THE SCARLET OAK,"nothing for a gardener. The falling leaves, all over the forest, are"
7806,THE SCARLET OAK,"protecting the roots of my plants. Only look at what is to be seen,"
7807,THE SCARLET OAK,"and you will have garden enough, without deepening the soil in your"
7808,THE SCARLET OAK,"yard. We have only to elevate our view a little, to see the whole"
7809,THE SCARLET OAK,"forest as a garden. The blossoming of the scarlet oak,--the"
7810,THE SCARLET OAK,"forest-flower, surpassing all in splendor (at least since the maple)!"
7811,THE SCARLET OAK,"I do not know but they interest me more than the maples, they are so"
7812,THE SCARLET OAK,"widely and equally dispersed throughout the forest; they are so hardy,"
7813,THE SCARLET OAK,"a nobler tree on the whole; our chief November flower, abiding the"
7814,THE SCARLET OAK,"approach of winter with us, imparting warmth to early November"
7815,THE SCARLET OAK,prospects. It is remarkable that the latest bright color that is
7816,THE SCARLET OAK,"general should be this deep, dark scarlet and red, the intensest of"
7817,THE SCARLET OAK,"colors. The ripest fruit of the year; like the cheek of a hard, glossy"
7818,THE SCARLET OAK,"red apple, from the cold Isle of Orleans, which will not be mellow for"
7819,THE SCARLET OAK,"eating till next spring! When I rise to a hilltop, a thousand of these"
7820,THE SCARLET OAK,"great oak roses, distributed on every side, as far as the horizon! I"
7821,THE SCARLET OAK,admire them four or five miles off! This my unfailing prospect for a
7822,THE SCARLET OAK,fortnight past! This late forest-flower surpasses all that spring or
7823,THE SCARLET OAK,summer could do. Their colors were but rare and dainty specks
7824,THE SCARLET OAK,"comparatively (created for the near-sighted, who walk amid the"
7825,THE SCARLET OAK,"humblest herbs and underwoods), and made no impression on a distant"
7826,THE SCARLET OAK,"eye. Now it is an extended forest or a mountain-side, through or along"
7827,THE SCARLET OAK,"which we journey from day to day, that bursts into bloom."
7828,THE SCARLET OAK,"Comparatively, our gardening is on a petty scale,--the gardener still"
7829,THE SCARLET OAK,"nursing a few asters amid dead weeds, ignorant of the gigantic asters"
7830,THE SCARLET OAK,"and roses which, as it were, overshadow him, and ask for none of his"
7831,THE SCARLET OAK,"care. It is like a little red paint ground on a saucer, and held up"
7832,THE SCARLET OAK,"against the sunset sky. Why not take more elevated and broader views,"
7833,THE SCARLET OAK,"walk in the great garden; not skulk in a little ""debauched"" nook of"
7834,THE SCARLET OAK,"it? consider the beauty of the forest, and not merely of a few"
7835,THE SCARLET OAK,impounded herbs?
7836,THE SCARLET OAK,
7837,THE SCARLET OAK,"Let your walks now be a little more adventurous; ascend the hills. If,"
7838,THE SCARLET OAK,"about the last of October, you ascend any hill in the outskirts of our"
7839,THE SCARLET OAK,"town, and probably of yours, and look over the forest, you may"
7840,THE SCARLET OAK,"see--well, what I have endeavored to describe. All this you surely"
7841,THE SCARLET OAK,"_will_ see, and much more, if you are prepared to see it,--if you"
7842,THE SCARLET OAK,"_look_ for it. Otherwise, regular and universal as this phenomenon is,"
7843,THE SCARLET OAK,"whether you stand on the hilltop or in the hollow, you will think for"
7844,THE SCARLET OAK,"threescore years and ten that all the wood is, at this season, sere"
7845,THE SCARLET OAK,"and brown. Objects are concealed from our view, not so much because"
7846,THE SCARLET OAK,they are out of the course of our visual ray as because we do not
7847,THE SCARLET OAK,bring our minds and eyes to bear on them; for there is no power to see
7848,THE SCARLET OAK,"in the eye itself, any more than in any other jelly. We do not realize"
7849,THE SCARLET OAK,"how far and widely, or how near and narrowly, we are to look. The"
7850,THE SCARLET OAK,greater part of the phenomena of Nature are for this reason concealed
7851,THE SCARLET OAK,from us all our lives. The gardener sees only the gardener's garden.
7852,THE SCARLET OAK,"Here, too, as in political economy, the supply answers to the demand."
7853,THE SCARLET OAK,Nature does not cast pearls before swine. There is just as much
7854,THE SCARLET OAK,beauty visible to us in the landscape as we are prepared to
7855,THE SCARLET OAK,"appreciate,--not a grain more. The actual objects which one man will"
7856,THE SCARLET OAK,see from a particular hilltop are just as different from those which
7857,THE SCARLET OAK,"another will see as the beholders are different. The scarlet oak must,"
7858,THE SCARLET OAK,"in a sense, be in your eye when you go forth. We cannot see anything"
7859,THE SCARLET OAK,"until we are possessed with the idea of it, take it into our"
7860,THE SCARLET OAK,"heads,--and then we can hardly see anything else. In my botanical"
7861,THE SCARLET OAK,"rambles I find that, first, the idea, or image, of a plant occupies my"
7862,THE SCARLET OAK,"thoughts, though it may seem very foreign to this locality,--no nearer"
7863,THE SCARLET OAK,"than Hudson's Bay,--and for some weeks or months I go thinking of it,"
7864,THE SCARLET OAK,"and expecting it, unconsciously, and at length I surely see it. This"
7865,THE SCARLET OAK,is the history of my finding a score or more of rare plants which I
7866,THE SCARLET OAK,could name. A man sees only what concerns him. A botanist absorbed in
7867,THE SCARLET OAK,the study of grasses does not distinguish the grandest pasture oaks.
7868,THE SCARLET OAK,"He, as it were, tramples down oaks unwittingly in his walk, or at most"
7869,THE SCARLET OAK,sees only their shadows. I have found that it required a different
7870,THE SCARLET OAK,"intention of the eye, in the same locality, to see different plants,"
7871,THE SCARLET OAK,"even when they were closely allied, as _Juncaceae_ and _Gramineae_:"
7872,THE SCARLET OAK,"when I was looking for the former, I did not see the latter in the"
7873,THE SCARLET OAK,"midst of them. How much more, then, it requires different intentions"
7874,THE SCARLET OAK,of the eye and of the mind to attend to different departments of
7875,THE SCARLET OAK,knowledge! How differently the poet and the naturalist look at
7876,THE SCARLET OAK,objects!
7877,THE SCARLET OAK,
7878,THE SCARLET OAK,"Take a New England selectman, and set him on the highest of our hills,"
7879,THE SCARLET OAK,"and tell him to look,--sharpening his sight to the utmost, and putting"
7880,THE SCARLET OAK,"on the glasses that suit him best (aye, using a spy-glass, if he"
7881,THE SCARLET OAK,"likes),--and make a full report. What, probably, will he _spy_?--what"
7882,THE SCARLET OAK,"will he _select_ to look at? Of course, he will see a Brocken spectre"
7883,THE SCARLET OAK,"of himself. He will see several meeting-houses, at least, and,"
7884,THE SCARLET OAK,"perhaps, that somebody ought to be assessed higher than he is, since"
7885,THE SCARLET OAK,"he has so handsome a wood-lot. Now take Julius Cæsar, or Emanuel"
7886,THE SCARLET OAK,"Swedenborg, or a Fiji-Islander, and set him up there. Or suppose all"
7887,THE SCARLET OAK,"together, and let them compare notes afterward. Will it appear that"
7888,THE SCARLET OAK,they have enjoyed the same prospect? What they will see will be as
7889,THE SCARLET OAK,"different as Rome was from heaven or hell, or the last from the Fiji"
7890,THE SCARLET OAK,"Islands. For aught we know, as strange a man as any of these is always"
7891,THE SCARLET OAK,at our elbow.
7892,THE SCARLET OAK,
7893,THE SCARLET OAK,"Why, it takes a sharpshooter to bring down even such trivial game as"
7894,THE SCARLET OAK,"snipes and woodcocks; he must take very particular aim, and know what"
7895,THE SCARLET OAK,"he is aiming at. He would stand a very small chance, if he fired at"
7896,THE SCARLET OAK,"random into the sky, being told that snipes were flying there. And so"
7897,THE SCARLET OAK,is it with him that shoots at beauty; though he wait till the sky
7898,THE SCARLET OAK,"falls, he will not bag any, if he does not already know its seasons"
7899,THE SCARLET OAK,"and haunts, and the color of its wing,--if he has not dreamed of it,"
7900,THE SCARLET OAK,"so that he can _anticipate_ it; then, indeed, he flushes it at every"
7901,THE SCARLET OAK,"step, shoots double and on the wing, with both barrels, even in"
7902,THE SCARLET OAK,"corn-fields. The sportsman trains himself, dresses, and watches"
7903,THE SCARLET OAK,"unweariedly, and loads and primes for his particular game. He prays"
7904,THE SCARLET OAK,"for it, and offers sacrifices, and so he gets it. After due and long"
7905,THE SCARLET OAK,"preparation, schooling his eye and hand, dreaming awake and asleep,"
7906,THE SCARLET OAK,"with gun and paddle and boat, he goes out after meadow-hens, which"
7907,THE SCARLET OAK,"most of his townsmen never saw nor dreamed of, and paddles for miles"
7908,THE SCARLET OAK,"against a head wind, and wades in water up to his knees, being out all"
7909,THE SCARLET OAK,"day without his dinner, and _therefore_ he gets them. He had them"
7910,THE SCARLET OAK,"half-way into his bag when he started, and has only to shove them"
7911,THE SCARLET OAK,down. The true sportsman can shoot you almost any of his game from his
7912,THE SCARLET OAK,windows: what else has he windows or eyes for? It comes and perches at
7913,THE SCARLET OAK,last on the barrel of his gun; but the rest of the world never see it
7914,THE SCARLET OAK,"_with the feathers on_. The geese fly exactly under his zenith, and"
7915,THE SCARLET OAK,"honk when they get there, and he will keep himself supplied by firing"
7916,THE SCARLET OAK,up his chimney; twenty musquash have the refusal of each one of his
7917,THE SCARLET OAK,"traps before it is empty. If he lives, and his game spirit increases,"
7918,THE SCARLET OAK,"heaven and earth shall fail him sooner than game; and when he dies, he"
7919,THE SCARLET OAK,"will go to more extensive and, perchance, happier hunting-grounds. The"
7920,THE SCARLET OAK,"fisherman, too, dreams of fish, sees a bobbing cork in his dreams,"
7921,THE SCARLET OAK,"till he can almost catch them in his sink-spout. I knew a girl who,"
7922,THE SCARLET OAK,"being sent to pick huckleberries, picked wild gooseberries by the"
7923,THE SCARLET OAK,"quart, where no one else knew that there were any, because she was"
7924,THE SCARLET OAK,accustomed to pick them up-country where she came from. The astronomer
7925,THE SCARLET OAK,"knows where to go star-gathering, and sees one clearly in his mind"
7926,THE SCARLET OAK,before any have seen it with a glass. The hen scratches and finds her
7927,THE SCARLET OAK,food right under where she stands; but such is not the way with the
7928,THE SCARLET OAK,hawk.

8090,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"road reminds me by its fragrance of all the wealth of Pomona,--carrying"
8091,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,me forward to those days when they will be collected in golden and
8092,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,ruddy heaps in the orchards and about the cider-mills.

8094,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"A week or two later, as you are going by orchards or gardens,"
8095,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"especially in the evenings, you pass through a little region possessed"
8096,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"by the fragrance of ripe apples, and thus enjoy them without price,"
8097,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,and without robbing anybody.
8098,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8099,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,There is thus about all natural products a certain volatile and
8100,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"ethereal quality which represents their highest value, and which"
8101,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"cannot be vulgarized, or bought and sold. No mortal has ever enjoyed"
8102,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"the perfect flavor of any fruit, and only the godlike among men begin"
8103,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,to taste its ambrosial qualities. For nectar and ambrosia are only
8104,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates
8105,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"fail to perceive,--just as we occupy the heaven of the gods without"
8106,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,knowing it. When I see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair
8107,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"and fragrant early apples to market, I seem to see a contest going on"
8108,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"between him and his horse, on the one side, and the apples on the"
8109,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"other, and, to my mind, the apples always gain it. Pliny says that"
8110,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"apples are the heaviest of all things, and that the oxen begin to"
8111,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,sweat at the mere sight of a load of them. Our driver begins to lose
8112,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not
8113,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"belong, that is, to any but the most beautiful. Though he gets out"
8114,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"from time to time, and feels of them, and thinks they are all there, I"
8115,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to
8116,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"heaven from his cart, while the pulp and skin and core only are going"
8117,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"to market. They are not apples, but pomace. Are not these still"
8118,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"Iduna's apples, the taste of which keeps the gods forever young? and"
8119,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,think you that they will let Loki or Thjassi carry them off to
8120,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"Jötunheim, while they grow wrinkled and gray? No, for Ragnarök, or the"
8121,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"destruction of the gods, is not yet."
8122,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8123,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"There is another thinning of the fruit, commonly near the end of"
8124,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"August or in September, when the ground is strewn with windfalls; and"
8125,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,this happens especially when high winds occur after rain. In some
8126,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,orchards you may see fully three quarters of the whole crop on the
8127,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"ground, lying in a circular form beneath the trees, yet hard and"
8128,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"green, or, if it is a hillside, rolled far down the hill. However, it"
8129,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. All the country over,"
8130,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"people are busy picking up the windfalls, and this will make them"
8131,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,cheap for early apple pies.
8132,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8133,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"In October, the leaves falling, the apples are more distinct on the"
8134,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,trees. I saw one year in a neighboring town some trees fuller of fruit
8135,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"than I remember to have ever seen before, small yellow apples hanging"
8136,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,over the road. The branches were gracefully drooping with their
8137,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"weight, like a barberry bush, so that the whole tree acquired a new"
8138,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"character. Even the topmost branches, instead of standing erect,"
8139,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,spread and drooped in all directions; and there were so many poles
8140,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,supporting the lower ones that they looked like pictures of banyan
8141,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"trees. As an old English manuscript says, ""The mo appelen the tree"
8142,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"bereth the more sche boweth to the folk."""
8143,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8144,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,Surely the apple is the noblest of fruits. Let the most beautiful or
8145,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"the swiftest have it. That should be the ""going"" price of apples."
8146,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8147,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,Between the 5th and 20th of October I see the barrels lie under the
8148,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,trees. And perhaps I talk with one who is selecting some choice
8149,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,barrels to fulfill an order. He turns a specked one over many times
8150,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"before he leaves it out. If I were to tell what is passing in my mind,"
8151,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,I should say that every one was specked which he had handled; for he
8152,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"rubs off all the bloom, and those fugacious ethereal qualities leave"
8153,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"it. Cool evenings prompt the farmers to make haste, and at length I"
8154,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees.
8155,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,
8156,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"It would be well, if we accepted these gifts with more joy and"
8157,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"gratitude, and did not think it enough simply to put a fresh load of"
8158,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,compost about the tree. Some old English customs are suggestive at

8160,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"It appears that ""on Christmas Eve the farmers and their men in"
8161,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"Devonshire take a large bowl of cider, with a toast in it, and"

8176,THE HISTORY OF THE APPLE TREE,"Also what was called ""apple-howling"" used to be practiced in various"

8204,THE WILD APPLE,
8205,THE WILD APPLE,"So much for the more civilized apple trees (_urbaniores_, as Pliny"
8206,THE WILD APPLE,calls them). I love better to go through the old orchards of ungrafted
8207,THE WILD APPLE,"apple trees, at what ever season of the year,--so irregularly planted:"
8208,THE WILD APPLE,sometimes two trees standing close together; and the rows so devious
8209,THE WILD APPLE,that you would think that they not only had grown while the owner was
8210,THE WILD APPLE,"sleeping, but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state. The rows"
8211,THE WILD APPLE,of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these.
8212,THE WILD APPLE,"But I now, alas, speak rather from memory than from any recent"
8213,THE WILD APPLE,"experience, such ravages have been made!"
8214,THE WILD APPLE,
8215,THE WILD APPLE,"Some soils, like a rocky tract called the Easterbrooks Country in my"
8216,THE WILD APPLE,"neighborhood, are so suited to the apple, that it will grow faster in"
8217,THE WILD APPLE,"them without any care, or if only the ground is broken up once a year,"
8218,THE WILD APPLE,than it will in many places with any amount of care. The owners of
8219,THE WILD APPLE,"this tract allow that the soil is excellent for fruit, but they say"
8220,THE WILD APPLE,"that it is so rocky that they have not patience to plow it, and that,"
8221,THE WILD APPLE,"together with the distance, is the reason why it is not cultivated."
8222,THE WILD APPLE,"There are, or were recently, extensive orchards there standing without"
8223,THE WILD APPLE,"order. Nay, they spring up wild and bear well there in the midst of"
8224,THE WILD APPLE,"pines, birches, maples, and oaks. I am often surprised to see rising"
8225,THE WILD APPLE,amid these trees the rounded tops of apple trees glowing with red or
8226,THE WILD APPLE,"yellow fruit, in harmony with the autumnal tints of the forest."
8227,THE WILD APPLE,
8228,THE WILD APPLE,"Going up the side of a cliff about the first of November, I saw a"
8229,THE WILD APPLE,"vigorous young apple tree, which, planted by birds or cows, had shot"
8230,THE WILD APPLE,"up amid the rocks and open woods there, and had now much fruit on it,"
8231,THE WILD APPLE,"uninjured by the frosts, when all cultivated apples were gathered. It"
8232,THE WILD APPLE,"was a rank, wild growth, with many green leaves on it still, and made"
8233,THE WILD APPLE,"an impression of thorniness. The fruit was hard and green, but looked"
8234,THE WILD APPLE,as if it would be palatable in the winter. Some was dangling on the
8235,THE WILD APPLE,"twigs, but more half buried in the wet leaves under the tree, or"
8236,THE WILD APPLE,rolled far down the hill amid the rocks. The owner knows nothing of
8237,THE WILD APPLE,"it. The day was not observed when it first blossomed, nor when it"
8238,THE WILD APPLE,"first bore fruit, unless by the chickadee. There was no dancing on the"
8239,THE WILD APPLE,"green beneath it in its honor, and now there is no hand to pluck its"
8240,THE WILD APPLE,"fruit,--which is only gnawed by squirrels, as I perceive. It has done"
8241,THE WILD APPLE,"double duty,--not only borne this crop, but each twig has grown a foot"
8242,THE WILD APPLE,"into the air. And this is _such_ fruit! bigger than many berries, we"
8243,THE WILD APPLE,"must admit, and carried home will be sound and palatable next spring."
8244,THE WILD APPLE,What care I for Iduna's apples so long as I can get these?
8245,THE WILD APPLE,
8246,THE WILD APPLE,"When I go by this shrub thus late and hardy, and see its dangling"
8247,THE WILD APPLE,"fruit, I respect the tree, and I am grateful for Nature's bounty, even"
8248,THE WILD APPLE,though I cannot eat it. Here on this rugged and woody hillside has
8249,THE WILD APPLE,"grown an apple tree, not planted by man, no relic of a former orchard,"
8250,THE WILD APPLE,"but a natural growth, like the pines and oaks. Most fruits which we"
8251,THE WILD APPLE,"prize and use depend entirely on our care. Corn and grain, potatoes,"
8252,THE WILD APPLE,"peaches, melons, etc., depend altogether on our planting; but the"
8253,THE WILD APPLE,apple emulates man's independence and enterprise. It is not simply
8254,THE WILD APPLE,"carried, as I have said, but, like him, to some extent, it has"
8255,THE WILD APPLE,"migrated to this New World, and is even, here and there, making its"
8256,THE WILD APPLE,way amid the aboriginal trees; just as the ox and dog and horse
8257,THE WILD APPLE,sometimes run wild and maintain themselves.

8278,THE CRAB,"The fruit, according to him, is about an inch and a half in diameter,"
8279,THE CRAB,and is intensely acid. Yet they make fine sweetmeats and also cider of
8280,THE CRAB,"them. He concludes that ""if, on being cultivated, it does not yield"
8281,THE CRAB,"new and palatable varieties, it will at least be celebrated for the"
8282,THE CRAB,"beauty of its flowers, and for the sweetness of its perfume."""
8283,THE CRAB,
8284,THE CRAB,"I never saw the crab-apple till May, 1861. I had heard of it through"
8285,THE CRAB,"Michaux, but more modern botanists, so far as I know, have not"
8286,THE CRAB,treated it as of any peculiar importance. Thus it was a half-fabulous
8287,THE CRAB,"tree to me. I contemplated a pilgrimage to the ""Glades,"" a portion of"
8288,THE CRAB,Pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection. I thought of
8289,THE CRAB,"sending to a nursery for it, but doubted if they had it, or would"
8290,THE CRAB,distinguish it from European varieties. At last I had occasion to go
8291,THE CRAB,"to Minnesota, and on entering Michigan I began to notice from the cars"
8292,THE CRAB,a tree with handsome rose-colored flowers. At first I thought it some
8293,THE CRAB,"variety of thorn; but it was not long before the truth flashed on me,"
8294,THE CRAB,that this was my long-sought crab-apple. It was the prevailing
8295,THE CRAB,flowering shrub or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the
8296,THE CRAB,"year,--about the middle of May. But the cars never stopped before one,"
8297,THE CRAB,and so I was launched on the bosom of the Mississippi without having
8298,THE CRAB,"touched one, experiencing the fate of Tantalus. On arriving at St."
8299,THE CRAB,"Anthony's Falls, I was sorry to be told that I was too far north for"
8300,THE CRAB,the crab-apple. Nevertheless I succeeded in finding it about eight
8301,THE CRAB,"miles west of the Falls; touched it and smelled it, and secured a"
8302,THE CRAB,lingering corymb of flowers for my herbarium. This must have been near
8303,THE CRAB,its northern limit.

8310,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"which, though descended from cultivated stocks, plant themselves in"
8311,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"distant fields and forests, where the soil is favorable to them. I"
8312,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"know of no trees which have more difficulties to contend with, and"
8313,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,which more sturdily resist their foes. These are the ones whose story
8314,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,we have to tell. It oftentimes reads thus:--
8315,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8316,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Near the beginning of May, we notice little thickets of apple trees"
8317,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"just springing up in the pastures where cattle have been,--as the"
8318,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"rocky ones of our Easterbrooks Country, or the top of Nobscot Hill, in"
8319,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Sudbury. One or two of these, perhaps, survive the drought and other"
8320,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"accidents,--their very birthplace defending them against the"
8321,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"encroaching grass and some other dangers, at first."
8322,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8323,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,In two years' time 't had thus
8324,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Reached the level of the rocks,"
8325,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Admired the stretching world,"
8326,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,Nor feared the wandering flocks.
8327,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8328,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,But at this tender age
8329,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,Its sufferings began:
8330,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,There came a browsing ox
8331,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,And cut it down a span.
8332,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8333,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"This time, perhaps, the ox does not notice it amid the grass; but the"
8334,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"next year, when it has grown more stout, he recognizes it for a"
8335,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"fellow-emigrant from the old country, the flavor of whose leaves and"
8336,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"twigs he well knows; and though at first he pauses to welcome it, and"
8337,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"express his surprise, and gets for answer, ""The same cause that"
8338,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"brought you here brought me,"" he nevertheless browses it again,"
8339,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"reflecting, it may be, that he has some title to it."
8340,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8341,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Thus cut down annually, it does not despair; but, putting forth two"
8342,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"short twigs for every one cut off, it spreads out low along the ground"
8343,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"in the hollows or between the rocks, growing more stout and scrubby,"
8344,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"until it forms, not a tree as yet, but a little pyramidal, stiff,"
8345,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"twiggy mass, almost as solid and impenetrable as a rock. Some of the"
8346,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"densest and most impenetrable clumps of bushes that I have ever seen,"
8347,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,as well on account of the closeness and stubbornness of their branches
8348,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"as of their thorns, have been these wild apple scrubs. They are more"
8349,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"like the scrubby fir and black spruce on which you stand, and"
8350,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"sometimes walk, on the tops of mountains, where cold is the demon they"
8351,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"contend with, than anything else. No wonder they are prompted to grow"
8352,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"thorns at last, to defend themselves against such foes. In their"
8353,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"thorniness, however, there is no malice, only some malic acid."
8354,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8355,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,The rocky pastures of the tract I have referred to--for they maintain
8356,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,their ground best in a rocky field--are thickly sprinkled with these
8357,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"little tufts, reminding you often of some rigid gray mosses or"
8358,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"lichens, and you see thousands of little trees just springing up"
8359,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"between them, with the seed still attached to them."
8360,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8361,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Being regularly clipped all around each year by the cows, as a hedge"
8362,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"with shears, they are often of a perfect conical or pyramidal form,"
8363,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"from one to four feet high, and more or less sharp, as if trimmed by"
8364,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"the gardener's art. In the pastures on Nobscot Hill and its spurs,"
8365,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,they make fine dark shadows when the sun is low. They are also an
8366,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,excellent covert from hawks for many small birds that roost and build
8367,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"in them. Whole flocks perch in them at night, and I have seen three"
8368,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,robins' nests in one which was six feet in diameter.
8369,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8370,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"No doubt many of these are already old trees, if you reckon from the"
8371,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"day they were planted, but infants still when you consider their"
8372,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,development and the long life before them. I counted the annual rings
8373,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"of some which were just one foot high, and as wide as high, and found"
8374,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"that they were about twelve years old, but quite sound and thrifty!"
8375,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"They were so low that they were unnoticed by the walker, while many of"

8377,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"considerable crops. But what you gain in time is perhaps in this case,"
8378,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"too, lost in power,--that is, in the vigor of the tree. This is their"
8379,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,pyramidal state.
8380,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8381,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"The cows continue to browse them thus for twenty years or more,"
8382,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"keeping them down and compelling them to spread, until at last they"
8383,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"are so broad that they become their own fence, when some interior"
8384,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"shoot, which their foes cannot reach, darts upward with joy: for it"
8385,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"has not forgotten its high calling, and bears its own peculiar fruit"
8386,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,in triumph.
8387,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,
8388,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"Such are the tactics by which it finally defeats its bovine foes. Now,"
8389,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"if you have watched the progress of a particular shrub, you will see"
8390,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"that it is no longer a simple pyramid or cone, but that out of its"
8391,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"apex there rises a sprig or two, growing more lustily perchance than"
8392,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"an orchard-tree, since the plant now devotes the whole of its"
8393,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,repressed energy to these upright parts. In a short time these become
8394,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,"a small tree, an inverted pyramid resting on the apex of the other, so"
8395,HOW THE WILD APPLE GROWS,that the whole has now the form of a vast hour-glass. The spreading

8475,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",are still perhaps as beautiful as ever. I make a great account of
8476,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","these fruits, which the farmers do not think it worth the while to"
8477,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","gather,--wild flavors of the Muse, vivacious and inspiriting. The"

8481,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8482,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","Such as grow quite wild, and are left out till the first of November,"
8483,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",I presume that the owner does not mean to gather. They belong to
8484,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","children as wild as themselves,--to certain active boys that I"

8487,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","We have met with them, and they are ours. These rights, long enough"

8493,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","for the boys, who go with climbing-poles and bags to collect them."""
8494,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8495,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","As for those I speak of, I pluck them as a wild fruit, native to this"
8496,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","quarter of the earth,--fruit of old trees that have been dying ever"
8497,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","since I was a boy and are not yet dead, frequented only by the"
8498,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","woodpecker and the squirrel, deserted now by the owner, who has not"

8502,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","strewn with spirited fruit,--some of it, perhaps, collected at"
8503,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","squirrel-holes, with the marks of their teeth by which they carried"

8505,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","some, especially in damp days, a shell-less snail. The very sticks and"

8507,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",savoriness of the fruit which has been so eagerly sought after in past
8508,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",years.
8509,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",

8513,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","October and November, when December and January, and perhaps February"
8514,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","and March even, have assuaged them somewhat. An old farmer in my"

8516,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","a kind of bow-arrow tang."""
8517,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8518,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","Apples for grafting appear to have been selected commonly, not so much"
8519,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","for their spirited flavor, as for their mildness, their size, and"
8520,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","bearing qualities,--not so much for their beauty, as for their"
8521,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","fairness and soundness. Indeed, I have no faith in the selected lists"
8522,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","of pomological gentlemen. Their ""Favorites"" and ""None-suches"" and"
8523,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","""Seek-no-farthers,"" when I have fruited them, commonly turn out very"
8524,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","tame and forgettable. They are eaten with comparatively little zest,"
8525,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",and have no real _tang_ nor _smack_ to them.
8526,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8527,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","What if some of these wildings are acrid and puckery, genuine"
8528,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","_verjuice_, do they not still belong to the _Pomaceæ_, which are"
8529,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",uniformly innocent and kind to our race? I still begrudge them to the
8530,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",cider-mill. Perhaps they are not fairly ripe yet.
8531,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8532,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",No wonder that these small and high-colored apples are thought to make
8533,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","the best cider. Loudon quotes from the ""Herefordshire Report,"" that"
8534,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","""apples of a small size are always, if equal in quality, to be"
8535,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","preferred to those of a larger size, in order that the rind and kernel"
8536,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","may bear the greatest proportion to the pulp, which affords the"
8537,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","weakest and most watery juice."" And he says that, ""to prove this, Dr."
8538,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","Symonds, of Hereford, about the year 1800, made one hogshead of cider"
8539,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","entirely from the rinds and cores of apples, and another from the pulp"
8540,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","only, when the first was found of extraordinary strength and flavor,"
8541,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","while the latter was sweet and insipid."""
8542,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8543,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","Evelyn says that the ""Red-strake"" was the favorite cider-apple in his"
8544,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","day; and he quotes one Dr. Newburg as saying, ""In Jersey 'tis a"
8545,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","general observation, as I hear, that the more of red any apple has in"
8546,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","its rind, the more proper it is for this use. Pale-faced apples they"
8547,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","exclude as much as may be from their cider-vat."" This opinion still"
8548,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",prevails.
8549,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8550,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",All apples are good in November. Those which the farmer leaves out as
8551,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",unsalable and unpalatable to those who frequent the markets are
8552,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","choicest fruit to the walker. But it is remarkable that the wild apple,"
8553,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",which I praise as so spirited and racy when eaten in the fields or
8554,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","woods, being brought into the house has frequently a harsh and crabbed"
8555,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",taste. The Saunterer's Apple not even the saunterer can eat in the
8556,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","house. The palate rejects it there, as it does haws and acorns, and"
8557,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","demands a tamed one; for there you miss the November air, which is the"
8558,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","sauce it is to be eaten with. Accordingly, when Tityrus, seeing the"
8559,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","lengthening shadows, invites Meliboeus to go home and pass the night"
8560,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","with him, he promises him _mild_ apples and soft chestnuts,--_mitia"
8561,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","poma_, _castaneæ molles_. I frequently pluck wild apples of so rich"
8562,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",and spicy a flavor that I wonder all orchardists do not get a scion
8563,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","from that tree, and I fail not to bring home my pockets full. But"
8564,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","perchance, when I take one out of my desk and taste it in my chamber,"
8565,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","I find it unexpectedly crude,--sour enough to set a squirrel's teeth"
8566,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",on edge and make a jay scream.
8567,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8568,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",These apples have hung in the wind and frost and rain till they have
8569,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","absorbed the qualities of the weather or season, and thus are highly"

8571,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","spirit. They must be eaten in _season_, accordingly,--that is,"
8572,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",out-of-doors.
8573,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8574,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","To appreciate the wild and sharp flavors of these October fruits, it"
8575,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",is necessary that you be breathing the sharp October or November air.
8576,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",The outdoor air and exercise which the walker gets give a different
8577,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","tone to his palate, and he craves a fruit which the sedentary would"
8578,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","call harsh and crabbed. They must be eaten in the fields, when your"
8579,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","system is all aglow with exercise, when the frosty weather nips your"
8580,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","fingers, the wind rattles the bare boughs or rustles the few remaining"
8581,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","leaves, and the jay is heard screaming around. What is sour in the"
8582,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",house a bracing walk makes sweet. Some of these apples might be
8583,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","labeled, ""To be eaten in the wind."""
8584,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8585,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",Of course no flavors are thrown away; they are intended for the taste
8586,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","that is up to them. Some apples have two distinct flavors, and perhaps"
8587,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","one half of them must be eaten in the house, the other outdoors. One"
8588,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","Peter Whitney wrote from Northborough in 1782, for the Proceedings of"
8589,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","the Boston Academy, describing an apple tree in that town ""producing"
8590,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","fruit of opposite qualities, part of the same apple being frequently"
8591,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","sour and the other sweet;"" also some all sour, and others all sweet,"

8594,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",There is a wild apple on Nawshawtuct Hill in my town which has to me a
8595,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","peculiarly pleasant bitter tang, not perceived till it is"

8613,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","temperatures, so with flavors; as with cold and heat, so with sour and"
8614,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","sweet. This natural raciness, the sours and bitters which the diseased"

8616,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8617,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",Let your condiments be in the condition of your senses. To appreciate

8621,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",
8622,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR","From my experience with wild apples, I can understand that there may"
8623,"THE FRUIT, AND ITS FLAVOR",be reason for a savage's preferring many kinds of food which the

8692,THE NAMING OF THEM,In 1836 there were in the garden of the London Horticultural Society
8693,THE NAMING OF THEM,more than fourteen hundred distinct sorts. But here are species which

8696,THE NAMING OF THEM,
8697,THE NAMING OF THEM,"Let us enumerate a few of these. I find myself compelled, after all,"
8698,THE NAMING OF THEM,to give the Latin names of some for the benefit of those who live

8701,THE NAMING OF THEM,
8702,THE NAMING OF THEM,"There is, first of all, the Wood Apple (_Malus sylvatica_); the"

8714,THE NAMING OF THEM,"has many synonyms: in an imperfect state, it is the _choleramorbifera"
8715,THE NAMING OF THEM,"aut dysenterifera_, _puerulis dilectissima_; the Apple which Atalanta"
8716,THE NAMING OF THEM,stopped to pick up; the Hedge Apple (_Malus sepium_); the Slug Apple
8717,THE NAMING OF THEM,"(_limacea_); the Railroad Apple, which perhaps came from a core thrown"

8733,THE LAST GLEANING,By the middle of November the wild apples have lost some of their
8734,THE LAST GLEANING,"brilliancy, and have chiefly fallen. A great part are decayed on the"
8735,THE LAST GLEANING,"ground, and the sound ones are more palatable than before. The note of"
8736,THE LAST GLEANING,"the chickadee sounds now more distinct, as you wander amid the old"
8737,THE LAST GLEANING,"trees, and the autumnal dandelion is half closed and tearful. But"
8738,THE LAST GLEANING,"still, if you are a skillful gleaner, you may get many a pocketful"
8739,THE LAST GLEANING,"even of grafted fruit, long after apples are supposed to be gone"
8740,THE LAST GLEANING,"out-of-doors. I know a Blue Pearmain tree, growing within the edge of"
8741,THE LAST GLEANING,"a swamp, almost as good as wild. You would not suppose that there was"
8742,THE LAST GLEANING,"any fruit left there, on the first survey, but you must look according"
8743,THE LAST GLEANING,"to system. Those which lie exposed are quite brown and rotten now, or"
8744,THE LAST GLEANING,perchance a few still show one blooming cheek here and there amid the
8745,THE LAST GLEANING,"wet leaves. Nevertheless, with experienced eyes, I explore amid the"
8746,THE LAST GLEANING,"bare alders and the huckleberry bushes and the withered sedge, and in"
8747,THE LAST GLEANING,"the crevices of the rocks, which are full of leaves, and pry under"
8748,THE LAST GLEANING,"the fallen and decaying ferns, which, with apple and alder leaves,"
8749,THE LAST GLEANING,"thickly strew the ground. For I know that they lie concealed, fallen"
8750,THE LAST GLEANING,into hollows long since and covered up by the leaves of the tree
8751,THE LAST GLEANING,"itself,--a proper kind of packing. From these lurking-places, anywhere"
8752,THE LAST GLEANING,"within the circumference of the tree, I draw forth the fruit, all wet"
8753,THE LAST GLEANING,"and glossy, maybe nibbled by rabbits and hollowed out by crickets, and"
8754,THE LAST GLEANING,perhaps with a leaf or two cemented to it (as Curzon an old manuscript
8755,THE LAST GLEANING,"from a monastery's mouldy cellar), but still with a rich bloom on it,"
8756,THE LAST GLEANING,"and at least as ripe and well-kept, if not better than those in"
8757,THE LAST GLEANING,"barrels, more crisp and lively than they. If these resources fail to"
8758,THE LAST GLEANING,"yield anything, I have learned to look between the bases of the"
8759,THE LAST GLEANING,"suckers which spring thickly from some horizontal limb, for now and"
8760,THE LAST GLEANING,"then one lodges there, or in the very midst of an alder-clump, where"
8761,THE LAST GLEANING,"they are covered by leaves, safe from cows which may have smelled them"
8762,THE LAST GLEANING,"out. If I am sharp-set, for I do not refuse the Blue Pearmain, I fill"
8763,THE LAST GLEANING,"my pockets on each side; and as I retrace my steps in the frosty eve,"
8764,THE LAST GLEANING,"being perhaps four or five miles from home, I eat one first from this"
8765,THE LAST GLEANING,"side, and then from that, to keep my balance."
8766,THE LAST GLEANING,
8767,THE LAST GLEANING,"I learn from Topsell's Gesner, whose authority appears to be Albertus,"
8768,THE LAST GLEANING,that the following is the way in which the hedgehog collects and
8769,THE LAST GLEANING,"carries home his apples. He says,--""His meat is apples, worms, or"
8770,THE LAST GLEANING,"grapes: when he findeth apples or grapes on the earth, he rolleth"
8771,THE LAST GLEANING,"himself upon them, until he have filled all his prickles, and then"
8772,THE LAST GLEANING,"carrieth them home to his den, never bearing above one in his mouth;"
8773,THE LAST GLEANING,"and if it fortune that one of them fall off by the way, he likewise"
8774,THE LAST GLEANING,"shaketh off all the residue, and walloweth upon them afresh, until"
8775,THE LAST GLEANING,"they be all settled upon his back again. So, forth he goeth, making a"
8776,THE LAST GLEANING,"noise like a cart-wheel; and if he have any young ones in his nest,"
8777,THE LAST GLEANING,"they pull off his load wherewithal he is loaded, eating thereof what"
8778,THE LAST GLEANING,"they please, and laying up the residue for the time to come."""

8783,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","Toward the end of November, though some of the sound ones are yet more"

8800,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",am better acquainted than with wine. All apples are good in this
8801,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","state, and your jaws are the cider-press. Others, which have more"
8802,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","substance, are a sweet and luscious food,--in my opinion of more worth"

8823,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",
8824,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","It is a fruit never carried to market, that I am aware of,--quite"

8827,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",
8828,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",The era of the Wild Apple will soon be past. It is a fruit which will
8829,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",probably become extinct in New England. You may still wander through
8830,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","old orchards of native fruit of great extent, which for the most part"
8831,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","went to the cider-mill, now all gone to decay. I have heard of an"
8832,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","orchard in a distant town, on the side of a hill, where the apples"
8833,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","rolled down and lay four feet deep against a wall on the lower side,"
8834,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",and this the owner cut down for fear they should be made into cider.

8838,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",I fear that he who walks over these fields a century hence will not
8839,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","know the pleasure of knocking off wild apples. Ah, poor man, there are"

8841,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","of the Baldwin and the Porter, I doubt if so extensive orchards are"
8842,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","set out to-day in my town as there were a century ago, when those vast"

8844,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","apples, when the pomace-heap was the only nursery, and trees cost"
8845,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",nothing but the trouble of setting them out. Men could afford then to
8846,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE",stick a tree by every wall-side and let it take its chance. I see
8847,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","nobody planting trees to-day in such out of the way places, along the"
8848,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","lonely roads and lanes, and at the bottom of dells in the wood. Now"
8849,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","that they have grafted trees, and pay a price for them, they collect"
8850,"THE ""FROZEN-THAWED"" APPLE","them into a plat by their houses, and fence them in,--and the end of"

8893,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8894,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Is not the midnight like Central Africa to most of us? Are we not
8895,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"tempted to explore it,--to penetrate to the shores of its Lake Tchad,"
8896,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"and discover the source of its Nile, perchance the Mountains of the"
8897,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Moon? Who knows what fertility and beauty, moral and natural, are"
8898,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"there to be found? In the Mountains of the Moon, in the Central Africa"
8899,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"of the night, there is where all Niles have their hidden heads. The"
8900,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"expeditions up the Nile as yet extend but to the Cataracts, or"
8901,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,perchance to the mouth of the White Nile; but it is the Black Nile
8902,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,that concerns us.
8903,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8904,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"I shall be a benefactor if I conquer some realms from the night, if I"

8907,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"beauty awake while they are asleep,--if I add to the domains of"
8908,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,poetry.
8909,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8910,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Night is certainly more novel and less profane than day. I soon
8911,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"discovered that I was acquainted only with its complexion, and as for"
8912,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the moon, I had seen her only as it were through a crevice in a"
8913,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"shutter, occasionally. Why not walk a little way in her light?"
8914,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8915,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Suppose you attend to the suggestions which the moon makes for one
8916,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"month, commonly in vain, will it not be very different from anything"
8917,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,in literature or religion? But why not study this Sanskrit? What if
8918,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"one moon has come and gone with its world of poetry, its weird"
8919,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"teachings, its oracular suggestions,--so divine a creature freighted"
8920,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"with hints for me, and I have not used her? One moon gone by"
8921,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,unnoticed?
8922,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8923,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"I think it was Dr. Chalmers who said, criticising Coleridge, that for"
8924,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"his part he wanted ideas which he could see all round, and not such as"
8925,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"he must look at away up in the heavens. Such a man, one would say,"
8926,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"would never look at the moon, because she never turns her other side"
8927,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,to us. The light which comes from ideas which have their orbit as
8928,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"distant from the earth, and which is no less cheering and enlightening"
8929,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"to the benighted traveler than that of the moon and stars, is"
8930,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,naturally reproached or nicknamed as moonshine by such. They are
8931,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"moonshine, are they? Well, then, do your night traveling when there is"
8932,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,no moon to light you; but I will be thankful for the light that
8933,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,reaches me from the star of least magnitude. Stars are lesser or
8934,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,greater only as they appear to us so. I will be thankful that I see so
8935,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"much as one side of a celestial idea, one side of the rainbow and the"
8936,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,sunset sky.
8937,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8938,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Men talk glibly enough about moonshine, as if they knew its qualities"
8939,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"very well, and despised them; as owls might talk of sunshine,--none of"
8940,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,your sunshine!--but this word commonly means merely something which
8941,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"they do not understand,--which they are abed and asleep to, however"
8942,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,much it may be worth their while to be up and awake to it.
8943,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8944,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"It must be allowed that the light of the moon, sufficient though it is"
8945,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"for the pensive walker, and not disproportionate to the inner light we"
8946,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"have, is very inferior in quality and intensity to that of the sun."
8947,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,But the moon is not to be judged alone by the quantity of light she
8948,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"sends to us, but also by her influence on the earth and its"
8949,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"inhabitants. ""The moon gravitates toward the earth, and the earth"
8950,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"reciprocally toward the moon."" The poet who walks by moonlight is"
8951,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,conscious of a tide in his thought which is to be referred to lunar
8952,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,influence. I will endeavor to separate the tide in my thoughts from
8953,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,the current distractions of the day. I would warn my hearers that they
8954,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"must not try my thoughts by a daylight standard, but endeavor to"
8955,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,realize that I speak out of the night. All depends on your point of
8956,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"view. In Drake's ""Collection of Voyages,"" Wafer says of some albinos"
8957,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"among the Indians of Darien: ""They are quite white, but their"
8958,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"whiteness is like that of a horse, quite different from the fair or"
8959,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"pale European, as they have not the least tincture of a blush or"
8960,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"sanguine complexion.... Their eyebrows are milk-white, as is likewise"
8961,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the hair of their heads, which is very fine.... They seldom go abroad"
8962,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"in the daytime, the sun being disagreeable to them, and causing their"
8963,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"eyes, which are weak and poring, to water, especially if it shines"
8964,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"towards them, yet they see very well by moonlight, from which we call"
8965,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"them moon-eyed."""
8966,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8967,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Neither in our thoughts in these moonlight walks, methinks, is there"
8968,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"""the least tincture of a blush or sanguine complexion,"" but we are"
8969,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"intellectually and morally albinos, children of Endymion, such is the"
8970,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,effect of conversing much with the moon.
8971,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8972,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,I complain of arctic voyagers that they do not enough remind us of the
8973,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"constant peculiar dreariness of the scenery, and the perpetual"
8974,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"twilight of the arctic night. So he whose theme is moonlight, though"
8975,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"he may find it difficult, must, as it were, illustrate it with the"
8976,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,light of the moon alone.
8977,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
8978,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Many men walk by day; few walk by night. It is a very different
8979,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"season. Take a July night, for instance. About ten o'clock,--when man"
8980,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"is asleep, and day fairly forgotten,--the beauty of moonlight is seen"
8981,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,over lonely pastures where cattle are silently feeding. On all sides
8982,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,novelties present themselves. Instead of the sun there are the moon
8983,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,and stars; instead of the wood thrush there is the whip-poor-will;
8984,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"instead of butterflies in the meadows, fireflies, winged sparks of"
8985,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,fire! who would have believed it? What kind of cool deliberate life
8986,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,dwells in those dewy abodes associated with a spark of fire? So man
8987,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"has fire in his eyes, or blood, or brain. Instead of singing birds,"
8988,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the half-throttled note of a cuckoo flying over, the croaking of"
8989,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"frogs, and the intenser dream of crickets. But above all, the"
8990,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"wonderful trump of the bullfrog, ringing from Maine to Georgia. The"
8991,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"potato vines stand upright, the corn grows apace, the bushes loom, the"
8992,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,grain-fields are boundless. On our open river terraces once cultivated
8993,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"by the Indian, they appear to occupy the ground like an army, their"
8994,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,heads nodding in the breeze. Small trees and shrubs are seen in the
8995,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"midst overwhelmed as by an inundation. The shadows of rocks and trees,"
8996,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"and shrubs and hills, are more conspicuous than the objects"
8997,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,themselves. The slightest irregularities in the ground are revealed by
8998,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the shadows, and what the feet find comparatively smooth appears rough"
8999,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,and diversified in consequence. For the same reason the whole
9000,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,landscape is more variegated and picturesque than by day. The smallest
9001,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,recesses in the rocks are dim and cavernous; the ferns in the wood
9002,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,appear of tropical size. The sweet-fern and indigo in overgrown
9003,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,wood-paths wet you with dew up to your middle. The leaves of the shrub
9004,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,oak are shining as if a liquid were flowing over them. The pools seen
9005,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"through the trees are as full of light as the sky. ""The light of the"
9006,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"day takes refuge in their bosoms,"" as the Purana says of the ocean."
9007,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,All white objects are more remarkable than by day. A distant cliff
9008,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,looks like a phosphorescent space on a hillside. The woods are heavy
9009,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,and dark. Nature slumbers. You see the moonlight reflected from
9010,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"particular stumps in the recesses of the forest, as if she selected"
9011,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,what to shine on. These small fractions of her light remind one of the
9012,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"plant called moonseed,--as if the moon were sowing it in such places."
9013,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9014,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,In the night the eyes are partly closed or retire into the head. Other
9015,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,senses take the lead. The walker is guided as well by the sense of
9016,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"smell. Every plant and field and forest emits its odor now, swamp-pink"
9017,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,in the meadow and tansy in the road; and there is the peculiar dry
9018,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,scent of corn which has begun to show its tassels. The senses both of
9019,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,hearing and smelling are more alert. We hear the tinkling of rills
9020,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"which we never detected before. From time to time, high up on the"
9021,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"sides of hills, you pass through a stratum of warm air, a blast which"
9022,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"has come up from the sultry plains of noon. It tells of the day, of"
9023,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"sunny noontide hours and banks, of the laborer wiping his brow and the"
9024,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,bee humming amid flowers. It is an air in which work has been
9025,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"done,--which men have breathed. It circulates about from woodside to"
9026,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"hillside like a dog that has lost its master, now that the sun is"
9027,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,gone. The rocks retain all night the warmth of the sun which they have
9028,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,absorbed. And so does the sand. If you dig a few inches into it you
9029,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,find a warm bed. You lie on your back on a rock in a pasture on the
9030,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"top of some bare hill at midnight, and speculate on the height of the"
9031,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"starry canopy. The stars are the jewels of the night, and perchance"
9032,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,surpass anything which day has to show. A companion with whom I was
9033,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"sailing one very windy but bright moonlight night, when the stars were"
9034,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"few and faint, thought that a man could get along with _them_, though"
9035,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"he was considerably reduced in his circumstances,--that they were a"
9036,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,kind of bread and cheese that never failed.
9037,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9038,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"No wonder that there have been astrologers, that some have conceived"
9039,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"that they were personally related to particular stars. Dubartas, as"
9040,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"translated by Sylvester, says he'll"
9041,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9042,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"""not believe that the great architect"
9043,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,With all these fires the heavenly arches decked
9044,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Only for show, and with these glistering shields,"
9045,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"T' awake poor shepherds, watching in the fields."""
9046,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"He'll ""not believe that the least flower which pranks"
9047,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Our garden borders, or our common banks,"
9048,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"And the least stone, that in her warming lap"
9049,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Our mother earth doth covetously wrap,"
9050,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Hath some peculiar virtue of its own,"
9051,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"And that the glorious stars of heav'n have none."""
9052,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9053,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"And Sir Walter Raleigh well says, ""The stars are instruments of far"
9054,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"greater use than to give an obscure light, and for men to gaze on"
9055,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"after sunset;"" and he quotes Plotinus as affirming that they ""are"
9056,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"significant, but not efficient;"" and also Augustine as saying, ""_Deus"
9057,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"regit inferiora corpora per superiora_:"" God rules the bodies below by"
9058,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,those above. But best of all is this which another writer has
9059,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"expressed: ""_Sapiens adjuvabit opus astrorum quemadmodum agricola"
9060,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"terrae naturam_:"" a wise man assisteth the work of the stars as the"
9061,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,husbandman helpeth the nature of the soil.
9062,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9063,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"It does not concern men who are asleep in their beds, but it is very"
9064,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"important to the traveler, whether the moon shines brightly or is"
9065,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"obscured. It is not easy to realize the serene joy of all the earth,"
9066,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"when she commences to shine unobstructedly, unless you have often been"
9067,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,abroad alone in moonlight nights. She seems to be waging continual war
9068,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,with the clouds in your behalf. Yet we fancy the clouds to be _her_
9069,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"foes also. She comes on magnifying her dangers by her light,"
9070,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"revealing, displaying them in all their hugeness and blackness, then"
9071,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"suddenly casts them behind into the light concealed, and goes her way"
9072,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,triumphant through a small space of clear sky.
9073,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9074,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"In short, the moon traversing, or appearing to traverse, the small"
9075,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"clouds which lie in her way, now obscured by them, now easily"
9076,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"dissipating and shining through them, makes the drama of the moonlight"
9077,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,night to all watchers and night-travelers. Sailors speak of it as the
9078,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"moon eating up the clouds. The traveler all alone, the moon all alone,"
9079,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"except for his sympathy, overcoming with incessant victory whole"
9080,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,squadrons of clouds above the forests and lakes and hills. When she is
9081,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,obscured he so sympathizes with her that he could whip a dog for her
9082,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"relief, as Indians do. When she enters on a clear field of great"
9083,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"extent in the heavens, and shines unobstructedly, he is glad. And when"
9084,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"she has fought her way through all the squadron of her foes, and rides"
9085,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"majestic in a clear sky unscathed, and there are no more any"
9086,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"obstructions in her path, he cheerfully and confidently pursues his"
9087,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"way, and rejoices in his heart, and the cricket also seems to express"
9088,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,joy in its song.
9089,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9090,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"How insupportable would be the days, if the night with its dews and"
9091,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,darkness did not come to restore the drooping world. As the shades
9092,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"begin to gather around us, our primeval instincts are aroused, and we"
9093,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"steal forth from our lairs, like the inhabitants of the jungle, in"
9094,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,search of those silent and brooding thoughts which are the natural
9095,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,prey of the intellect.

9100,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,in the hush and quiet of darkness. Thoughts which day turns into smoke
9101,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,and mist stand about us in the night as light and flames; even as the
9102,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"column which fluctuates above the crater of Vesuvius, in the daytime"
9103,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"appears a pillar of cloud, but by night a pillar of fire."""
9104,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9105,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"There are nights in this climate of such serene and majestic beauty,"
9106,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"so medicinal and fertilizing to the spirit, that methinks a sensitive"
9107,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"nature would not devote them to oblivion, and perhaps there is no man"
9108,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"but would be better and wiser for spending them out-of-doors, though"
9109,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"he should sleep all the next day to pay for it,--should sleep an"
9110,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Endymion sleep, as the ancients expressed it,--nights which warrant"
9111,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the Grecian epithet ambrosial, when, as in the land of Beulah, the"
9112,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"atmosphere is charged with dewy fragrance, and with music, and we take"
9113,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"our repose and have our dreams awake,--when the moon, not secondary to"
9114,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"the sun,--"
9115,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
9116,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"""gives us his blaze again,"
9117,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Void of its flame, and sheds a softer day."

9139,NIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,a master. The village street is then as wild as the forest. New and

9338,HERMES.,Necessity's is a resistless strength.
9339,HERMES.,But neither to be silent nor unsilent about this
9340,HERMES.,Lot is possible for me; for a gift to mortals
9341,HERMES.,"Giving, I wretched have been yoked to these necessities;"
9342,HERMES.,Within a hollow reed by stealth I carry off fire's
9343,HERMES.,"Stolen source, which seemed the teacher"
9344,HERMES.,"Of all art to mortals, and a great resource."
9345,HERMES.,"For such crimes penalty I pay,"
9346,HERMES.,"Under the sky, riveted in chains."
9347,HERMES.,Ah! ah! alas! alas!
9348,HERMES.,"What echo, what odor has flown to me obscure,"
9349,HERMES.,"Of god, or mortal, or else mingled,--"
9350,HERMES.,Came it to this terminal hill
9351,HERMES.,"A witness of my sufferings, or wishing what?"
9352,HERMES.,"Behold bound me an unhappy god,"
9353,HERMES.,"The enemy of Zeus, fallen under"
9354,HERMES.,"The ill will of all the gods, as many as"
9355,HERMES.,"Enter into the hall of Zeus,"
9356,HERMES.,Through too great love of mortals.
9357,HERMES.,Alas! alas! what fluttering do I hear
9358,HERMES.,Of birds near? for the air rustles
9359,HERMES.,With the soft rippling of wings.
9360,HERMES.,Everything to me is fearful which creeps this way.
9361,HERMES.,
9362,HERMES.,PROMETHEUS _and_ CHORUS.
9363,HERMES.,
9364,HERMES.,_Ch._ Fear nothing; for friendly this band
9365,HERMES.,Of wings with swift contention
9366,HERMES.,"Drew to this hill, hardly"
9367,HERMES.,Persuading the paternal mind.
9368,HERMES.,The swift-carrying breezes sent me;
9369,HERMES.,For the echo of beaten steel pierced the recesses
9370,HERMES.,"Of the caves, and struck out from me reserved modesty;"
9371,HERMES.,And I rushed unsandaled in a winged chariot.
9372,HERMES.,
9373,HERMES.,_Pr._ Alas! alas! alas! alas!
9374,HERMES.,"Offspring of the fruitful Tethys,"
9375,HERMES.,And of him rolling around all
9376,HERMES.,"The earth with sleepless stream children,"
9377,HERMES.,"Of Father Ocean; behold, look on me;"
9378,HERMES.,By what bonds embraced
9379,HERMES.,On this cliff's topmost rocks
9380,HERMES.,I shall maintain unenvied watch.
9381,HERMES.,
9382,HERMES.,"_Ch._ I see, Prometheus; but to my eyes a fearful"
9383,HERMES.,Mist has come surcharged
9384,HERMES.,"With tears, looking upon thy body"
9385,HERMES.,Shrunk to the rocks
9386,HERMES.,By these mischiefs of adamantine bonds;
9387,HERMES.,"Indeed, new helmsmen rule Olympus;"
9388,HERMES.,"And with new laws Zeus strengthens himself, annulling the old,"
9389,HERMES.,And the before great now makes unknown.
9390,HERMES.,
9391,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Would that under earth, and below Hades,"
9392,HERMES.,"Receptacle of dead, to impassable"
9393,HERMES.,"Tartarus he had sent me, to bonds indissoluble"
9394,HERMES.,"Cruelly conducting, that neither god"
9395,HERMES.,Nor any other had rejoiced at this.
9396,HERMES.,"But now the sport of winds, unhappy one,"
9397,HERMES.,"A source of pleasure to my foes, I suffer."
9398,HERMES.,
9399,HERMES.,_Ch._ Who so hard-hearted
9400,HERMES.,"Of the gods, to whom these things are pleasant?"
9401,HERMES.,Who does not sympathize with thy
9402,HERMES.,"Misfortunes, excepting Zeus? for he in wrath always"
9403,HERMES.,"Fixing his stubborn mind,"
9404,HERMES.,Afflicts the heavenly race;
9405,HERMES.,"Nor will he cease, until his heart is sated;"
9406,HERMES.,Or with some palm some one may take the power hard to be taken.
9407,HERMES.,
9408,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Surely yet, though in strong"
9409,HERMES.,"Fetters I am now maltreated,"
9410,HERMES.,"The ruler of the blessed will have need of me,"
9411,HERMES.,To show the new conspiracy by which
9412,HERMES.,"He's robbed of sceptre and of honors,"
9413,HERMES.,And not at all me with persuasion's honey-tongued
9414,HERMES.,"Charms will he appease, nor ever,"
9415,HERMES.,"Shrinking from his firm threats, will I"
9416,HERMES.,"Declare this, till from cruel"
9417,HERMES.,"Bonds he may release, and to do justice"
9418,HERMES.,For this outrage be willing.
9419,HERMES.,
9420,HERMES.,_Ch._ You are bold; and to bitter
9421,HERMES.,"Woes do nothing yield,"
9422,HERMES.,But too freely speak.
9423,HERMES.,But my mind piercing fear disturbs;
9424,HERMES.,"For I'm concerned about thy fortunes,"
9425,HERMES.,Where at length arriving you may see
9426,HERMES.,An end to these afflictions. For manners
9427,HERMES.,"Inaccessible, and a heart hard to be dissuaded has the son"
9428,HERMES.,of Kronos.
9429,HERMES.,
9430,HERMES.,"_Pr._ I know, that--Zeus is stern and having"
9431,HERMES.,Justice to himself. But after all
9432,HERMES.,Gentle-minded
9433,HERMES.,"He will one day be, when thus he's crushed,"
9434,HERMES.,"And his stubborn wrath allaying,"
9435,HERMES.,Into agreement with me and friendliness
9436,HERMES.,Earnest to me earnest he at length will come.
9437,HERMES.,
9438,HERMES.,"_Ch._ The whole account disclose and tell us plainly,"
9439,HERMES.,In what crime taking you Zeus
9440,HERMES.,Thus disgracefully and bitterly insults;
9441,HERMES.,"Inform us, if you are nowise hurt by the recital."
9442,HERMES.,
9443,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Painful indeed it is to me to tell these things,"
9444,HERMES.,"And a pain to be silent, and every way unfortunate."
9445,HERMES.,"When first the divinities began their strife,"
9446,HERMES.,"And discord 'mong themselves arose,"
9447,HERMES.,"Some wishing to cast Kronos from his seat,"
9448,HERMES.,"That Zeus might reign, forsooth, others the contrary"
9449,HERMES.,"Striving, that Zeus might never rule the gods;"
9450,HERMES.,"Then I, the best advising, to persuade"
9451,HERMES.,"The Titans, sons of Uranus and Chthon,"
9452,HERMES.,Unable was; but crafty stratagems
9453,HERMES.,"Despising with rude minds,"
9454,HERMES.,They thought without trouble to rule by force;
9455,HERMES.,"But to me my mother not once only, Themis,"
9456,HERMES.,"And Gæa, of many names one form,"
9457,HERMES.,"How the future should be accomplished had foretold,"
9458,HERMES.,That not by power nor by strength
9459,HERMES.,"Would it be necessary, but by craft the victors should prevail."
9460,HERMES.,"Such I in words expounding,"
9461,HERMES.,They deigned not to regard at all.
9462,HERMES.,"The best course, therefore, of those occurring then"
9463,HERMES.,"Appeared to be, taking my mother to me,"
9464,HERMES.,Of my own accord to side with Zeus glad to receive me;
9465,HERMES.,And by my counsels Tartarus' black-pitted
9466,HERMES.,"Depths conceals the ancient Kronos,"
9467,HERMES.,With his allies. In such things by me
9468,HERMES.,"The tyrant of the gods having been helped,"
9469,HERMES.,With base rewards like these repays me;
9470,HERMES.,For there is somehow in kingship
9471,HERMES.,"This disease, not to trust its friends."
9472,HERMES.,"What then you ask, for what cause"
9473,HERMES.,"He afflicts me, this will I now explain."
9474,HERMES.,As soon as on his father's throne
9475,HERMES.,"He sat, he straightway to the gods distributes honors,"
9476,HERMES.,"Some to one and to another some, and arranged"
9477,HERMES.,The government; but of unhappy mortals account
9478,HERMES.,Had none; but blotting out the race
9479,HERMES.,"Entire, wished to create another new."
9480,HERMES.,"And these things none opposed but I,"
9481,HERMES.,But I adventured; I rescued mortals
9482,HERMES.,From going destroyed to Hades.
9483,HERMES.,"Therefore, indeed, with such afflictions am I bent,"
9484,HERMES.,"To suffer grievous, and piteous to behold,"
9485,HERMES.,"And, holding mortals up to pity, myself am not"
9486,HERMES.,Thought worthy to obtain it; but without pity
9487,HERMES.,"Am I thus corrected, a spectacle inglorious to Zeus."
9488,HERMES.,
9489,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Of iron heart and made of stone,"
9490,HERMES.,"Whoe'er, Prometheus, with thy sufferings"
9491,HERMES.,Does not grieve; for I should not have wished to see
9492,HERMES.,"These things, and having seen them I am grieved at heart."
9493,HERMES.,
9494,HERMES.,_Pr._ Indeed to friends I'm piteous to behold.
9495,HERMES.,
9496,HERMES.,_Ch._ Did you in no respect go beyond this?
9497,HERMES.,
9498,HERMES.,"_Pr._ True, mortals I made cease foreseeing fate."
9499,HERMES.,
9500,HERMES.,_Ch._ Having found what remedy for this all?
9501,HERMES.,
9502,HERMES.,_Pr._ Blind hopes in them I made to dwell.
9503,HERMES.,
9504,HERMES.,_Ch._ A great advantage this you gave to men.
9505,HERMES.,
9506,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Beside these, too, I bestowed on them fire."
9507,HERMES.,
9508,HERMES.,_Ch._ And have mortals flamy fire?
9509,HERMES.,
9510,HERMES.,"_Pr._ From which, indeed, they will learn many arts."
9511,HERMES.,
9512,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Upon such charges, then, does Zeus"
9513,HERMES.,"Maltreat you, and nowhere relax from ills?"
9514,HERMES.,Is there no term of suffering lying before thee?
9515,HERMES.,
9516,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Nay, none at all, but when to him it may seem good."
9517,HERMES.,
9518,HERMES.,_Ch._ And how will it seem good? What hope? See you not that
9519,HERMES.,"You have erred? But how you've erred, for me to tell"
9520,HERMES.,"Not pleasant, and to you a pain. But these things"
9521,HERMES.,"Let us omit, and seek you some release from sufferings."
9522,HERMES.,
9523,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Easy, whoever out of trouble holds his"
9524,HERMES.,"Foot, to admonish and remind those faring"
9525,HERMES.,Ill. But all these things I knew;
9526,HERMES.,"Willing, willing I erred, I'll not deny;"
9527,HERMES.,Mortals assisting I myself found trouble.
9528,HERMES.,Not indeed with penalties like these thought I
9529,HERMES.,"That I should pine on lofty rocks,"
9530,HERMES.,Gaining this drear unneighbored hill.
9531,HERMES.,"But bewail not my present woes,"
9532,HERMES.,"But alighting, the fortunes creeping on"
9533,HERMES.,"Hear ye, that ye may learn all to the end."
9534,HERMES.,"Obey me, obey, sympathize"
9535,HERMES.,"With him now suffering. Thus indeed affliction,"
9536,HERMES.,"Wandering round, sits now by one, then by another."
9537,HERMES.,
9538,HERMES.,_Ch._ Not to unwilling ears do you urge
9539,HERMES.,"This, Prometheus."
9540,HERMES.,And now with light foot the swift-rushing
9541,HERMES.,"Seat leaving, and the pure ether,"
9542,HERMES.,"Path of birds, to this peaked"
9543,HERMES.,Ground I come; for thy misfortunes
9544,HERMES.,I wish fully to hear.
9545,HERMES.,
9546,HERMES.,"PROMETHEUS, CHORUS, _and_ OCEANUS."
9547,HERMES.,
9548,HERMES.,_Oc._ I come to the end of a long way
9549,HERMES.,"Traveling to thee, Prometheus,"
9550,HERMES.,By my will without bits directing
9551,HERMES.,This wing-swift bird;
9552,HERMES.,For at thy fortunes know I grieve.
9553,HERMES.,"And, I think, affinity thus"
9554,HERMES.,"Impels me, but apart from birth,"
9555,HERMES.,There's not to whom a higher rank
9556,HERMES.,I would assign than thee.
9557,HERMES.,"And you will know these things as true, and not in vain"
9558,HERMES.,"To flatter with the tongue is in me. Come, therefore,"
9559,HERMES.,Show how it is necessary to assist you;
9560,HERMES.,"For never will you say, than Ocean"
9561,HERMES.,There's a firmer friend to thee.
9562,HERMES.,
9563,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Alas! what now? And you, then, of my sufferings"
9564,HERMES.,"Come spectator? How didst thou dare, leaving"
9565,HERMES.,"The stream which bears thy name, and rock-roofed"
9566,HERMES.,"Caves self-built, to the iron-mother"
9567,HERMES.,Earth to go? To behold my fate
9568,HERMES.,"Hast come, and to compassionate my ills?"
9569,HERMES.,"Behold a spectacle, this, the friend of Zeus,"
9570,HERMES.,"Having with him stablished his tyranny,"
9571,HERMES.,With what afflictions by himself I'm bent.
9572,HERMES.,
9573,HERMES.,"_Oc._ I see, Prometheus, and would admonish"
9574,HERMES.,"Thee the best, although of varied craft."
9575,HERMES.,"Know thyself, and fit thy manners"
9576,HERMES.,New; for new also the king among the gods.
9577,HERMES.,For if thus rude and whetted words
9578,HERMES.,"Thou wilt hurl out, quickly may Zeus, though sitting"
9579,HERMES.,"Far above, hear thee, so that thy present wrath"
9580,HERMES.,Of troubles child's play will seem to be.
9581,HERMES.,"But, O wretched one, dismiss the indignation which thou hast,"
9582,HERMES.,And seek deliverance from these woes.
9583,HERMES.,"Like an old man, perhaps, I seem to thee to say these things;"
9584,HERMES.,"Such, however, are the wages"
9585,HERMES.,"Of the too lofty speaking tongue, Prometheus;"
9586,HERMES.,"But thou art not yet humble, nor dost yield to ills,"
9587,HERMES.,And beside the present wish to receive others still.
9588,HERMES.,"But thou wouldst not, with my counsel,"
9589,HERMES.,"Against the pricks extend your limbs, seeing that"
9590,HERMES.,A stern monarch irresponsible reigns.
9591,HERMES.,"And now I go, and will endeavor,"
9592,HERMES.,"If I can, to release thee from these sufferings."
9593,HERMES.,"But be thou quiet, nor too rudely speak."
9594,HERMES.,"Know'st thou not well, with thy superior wisdom, that"
9595,HERMES.,On a vain tongue punishment is inflicted?
9596,HERMES.,
9597,HERMES.,"_Pr._ I congratulate thee that thou art without blame,"
9598,HERMES.,Having shared and dared all with me;
9599,HERMES.,"And now leave off, and let it not concern thee."
9600,HERMES.,"For altogether thou wilt not persuade him, for he's not easily"
9601,HERMES.,"persuaded,"
9602,HERMES.,But take heed yourself lest you be injured by the way.
9603,HERMES.,
9604,HERMES.,_Oc._ Far better thou art to advise those near
9605,HERMES.,Than thyself; by deed and not by word I judge.
9606,HERMES.,"But me hastening by no means mayest thou detain,"
9607,HERMES.,"For I boast, I boast, this favor will Zeus"
9608,HERMES.,"Grant me, from these sufferings to release thee."
9609,HERMES.,
9610,HERMES.,"_Pr._ So far I praise thee, and will never cease;"
9611,HERMES.,For zeal you nothing lack. But
9612,HERMES.,"Strive not; for in vain, naught helping"
9613,HERMES.,"Me, thou 'lt strive, if aught to strive you wish."
9614,HERMES.,"But be thou quiet, holding thyself aloof,"
9615,HERMES.,"For I would not, though I'm unfortunate, that on this account"
9616,HERMES.,Evils should come to many.
9617,HERMES.,
9618,HERMES.,"_Oc._ Surely not, for me too the fortunes of thy brother"
9619,HERMES.,"Atlas grieve, who towards the evening-places"
9620,HERMES.,"Stands, the pillar of heaven and earth"
9621,HERMES.,"Upon his shoulders bearing, a load not easy to be borne."
9622,HERMES.,And the earth-born inhabitant of the Cilician
9623,HERMES.,"Caves seeing, I pitied, the savage monster"
9624,HERMES.,"With a hundred heads, by force o'ercome,"
9625,HERMES.,"Typhon impetuous, who stood 'gainst all the gods,"
9626,HERMES.,With frightful jaws hissing out slaughter;
9627,HERMES.,"And from his eyes flashed a Gorgonian light,"
9628,HERMES.,Utterly to destroy by force the sovereignty of Zeus;
9629,HERMES.,"But there came to him Zeus' sleepless bolt,"
9630,HERMES.,"Descending thunder, breathing flame,"
9631,HERMES.,Which struck him out from lofty
9632,HERMES.,"Boastings. For, struck to his very heart,"
9633,HERMES.,His strength was scorched and thundered out.
9634,HERMES.,And now a useless and extended carcass
9635,HERMES.,"Lies he near a narrow passage of the sea,"
9636,HERMES.,Pressed down under the roots of Ætna.
9637,HERMES.,"And on the topmost summit seated, Hephaistus"
9638,HERMES.,"Hammers the ignited mass, whence will burst out at length"
9639,HERMES.,"Rivers of fire, devouring with wild jaws"
9640,HERMES.,Fair-fruited Sicily's smooth fields;
9641,HERMES.,Such rage will Typhon make boil over
9642,HERMES.,"With hot discharges of insatiable fire-breathing tempest,"
9643,HERMES.,Though by the bolt of Zeus burnt to a coal.
9644,HERMES.,
9645,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Thou art not inexperienced, nor dost want"
9646,HERMES.,My counsel; secure thyself as thou know'st how;
9647,HERMES.,"And I against the present fortune will bear up,"
9648,HERMES.,Until the thought of Zeus may cease from wrath.
9649,HERMES.,
9650,HERMES.,"_Oc._ Know'st thou not this, Prometheus, that"
9651,HERMES.,Words are healers of distempered wrath?
9652,HERMES.,
9653,HERMES.,"_Pr._ If any seasonably soothe the heart,"
9654,HERMES.,And swelling passion check not rudely.
9655,HERMES.,
9656,HERMES.,_Oc._ In the consulting and the daring
9657,HERMES.,What harm seest thou existing? Teach me.
9658,HERMES.,
9659,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Trouble superfluous, and light-minded folly."
9660,HERMES.,
9661,HERMES.,"_Oc._ Be this my ail then, since it is"
9662,HERMES.,"Most profitable, being wise, not to seem wise."
9663,HERMES.,
9664,HERMES.,_Pr._ This will seem to be my error.
9665,HERMES.,
9666,HERMES.,_Oc._ Plainly homeward thy words remand me.
9667,HERMES.,
9668,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Aye, let not grief for me into hostility cast thee."
9669,HERMES.,
9670,HERMES.,_Oc._ To the new occupant of the all-powerful seats?
9671,HERMES.,
9672,HERMES.,_Pr._ Beware lest ever his heart be angered.
9673,HERMES.,
9674,HERMES.,"_Oc._ Thy fate, Prometheus, is my teacher."
9675,HERMES.,
9676,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Go thou, depart; preserve the present mind."
9677,HERMES.,
9678,HERMES.,_Oc._ To me rushing this word you utter.
9679,HERMES.,For the smooth path of the air sweeps with his wings
9680,HERMES.,The four-legged bird; and gladly would
9681,HERMES.,In the stalls at home bend a knee.
9682,HERMES.,
9683,HERMES.,PROMETHEUS _and_ CHORUS.
9684,HERMES.,
9685,HERMES.,_Ch._ I mourn for thee thy ruinous
9686,HERMES.,"Fate, Prometheus,"
9687,HERMES.,And tear-distilling from my tender
9688,HERMES.,Eyes a stream has wet
9689,HERMES.,My cheeks with flowing springs;
9690,HERMES.,"For these, unenvied, Zeus"
9691,HERMES.,"By his own laws enforcing,"
9692,HERMES.,Haughty above the gods
9693,HERMES.,That were displays his sceptre.
9694,HERMES.,And every region now
9695,HERMES.,"With groans resounds,"
9696,HERMES.,Mourning the illustrious
9697,HERMES.,And ancient honor
9698,HERMES.,Of thee and of thy kindred;
9699,HERMES.,As many mortals as the habitable seat
9700,HERMES.,"Of sacred Asia pasture,"
9701,HERMES.,With thy lamentable
9702,HERMES.,Woes have sympathy;
9703,HERMES.,"And of the Colchian land, virgin"
9704,HERMES.,"Inhabitants, in fight undaunted,"
9705,HERMES.,"And Scythia's multitude, who the last"
9706,HERMES.,"Place of earth, about"
9707,HERMES.,"Mæotis lake possess,"
9708,HERMES.,"And Arabia's martial flower,"
9709,HERMES.,And who the high-hung citadels
9710,HERMES.,"Of Caucasus inhabit near,"
9711,HERMES.,"A hostile army, raging"
9712,HERMES.,With sharp-prowed spears.
9713,HERMES.,"Only one other god before, in sufferings"
9714,HERMES.,Subdued by injuries
9715,HERMES.,"Of adamantine bonds, I've seen, Titanian"
9716,HERMES.,"Atlas, who always with superior strength"
9717,HERMES.,The huge and heavenly globe
9718,HERMES.,On his back bears;
9719,HERMES.,And with a roar the sea waves
9720,HERMES.,"Dashing, groans the deep,"
9721,HERMES.,And the dark depth of Hades murmurs underneath
9722,HERMES.,"The earth, and fountains of pure-running rivers"
9723,HERMES.,Heave a pitying sigh.
9724,HERMES.,
9725,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Think not, indeed, through weakness or through pride"
9726,HERMES.,"That I am silent; for with the consciousness I gnaw my heart,"
9727,HERMES.,Seeing myself thus basely used.
9728,HERMES.,And yet to these new gods their shares
9729,HERMES.,Who else than I wholly distributed?
9730,HERMES.,But of these things I am silent; for I should tell you
9731,HERMES.,What you know; the sufferings of mortals too
9732,HERMES.,"You've heard, how I made intelligent"
9733,HERMES.,And possessed of sense them ignorant before.
9734,HERMES.,"But I will speak, not bearing any grudge to men,"
9735,HERMES.,But showing in what I gave the good intention;
9736,HERMES.,"At first, indeed, seeing they saw in vain,"
9737,HERMES.,And hearing heard not; but like the forms
9738,HERMES.,"Of dreams, for that long time, rashly confounded"
9739,HERMES.,"All, nor brick-woven dwellings"
9740,HERMES.,"Knew they, placed in the sun, nor woodwork;"
9741,HERMES.,"But digging down they dwelt, like puny"
9742,HERMES.,"Ants, in sunless nooks of caves."
9743,HERMES.,"And there was naught to them, neither of winter sign,"
9744,HERMES.,"Nor of flower-giving spring, nor fruitful"
9745,HERMES.,"Summer, that was sure; but without knowledge"
9746,HERMES.,"Did they all, till I taught them the risings"
9747,HERMES.,"Of the stars, and goings down, hard to determine."
9748,HERMES.,"And numbers, chief of inventions,"
9749,HERMES.,"I found out for them, and the assemblages of letters,"
9750,HERMES.,"And memory, Muse-mother, doer of all things;"
9751,HERMES.,And first I joined in pairs wild animals
9752,HERMES.,Obedient to the yoke; and that they might be
9753,HERMES.,Alternate workers with the bodies of men
9754,HERMES.,"In the severest toils, I harnessed the rein-loving horses"
9755,HERMES.,"To the car, the ornament of over-wealthy luxury."
9756,HERMES.,And none else than I invented the sea-wandering
9757,HERMES.,Flaxen-winged vehicles of sailors.
9758,HERMES.,Such inventions I wretched having found out
9759,HERMES.,"For men, myself have not the ingenuity by which"
9760,HERMES.,From the now present ill I may escape.
9761,HERMES.,
9762,HERMES.,_Ch._ You suffer unseemly ill; deranged in mind
9763,HERMES.,"You err; and as some bad physician, falling"
9764,HERMES.,"Sick you are dejected, and cannot find"
9765,HERMES.,By what remedies you may be healed.
9766,HERMES.,
9767,HERMES.,_Pr._ Hearing the rest from me more will you wonder
9768,HERMES.,What arts and what expedients I planned.
9769,HERMES.,"That which was greatest, if any might fall sick,"
9770,HERMES.,"There was alleviation none, neither to eat,"
9771,HERMES.,"Nor to anoint, nor drink, but for the want"
9772,HERMES.,"Of medicines they were reduced to skeletons, till to them"
9773,HERMES.,"I showed the mingling of mild remedies,"
9774,HERMES.,By which all ails they drive away.
9775,HERMES.,"And many modes of prophecy I settled,"
9776,HERMES.,And distinguished first of dreams what a real
9777,HERMES.,"Vision is required to be, and omens hard to be determined"
9778,HERMES.,"I made known to them; and tokens by the way,"
9779,HERMES.,And flight of crooked-taloned birds I accurately
9780,HERMES.,"Defined, which lucky are,"
9781,HERMES.,"And unlucky, and what mode of life"
9782,HERMES.,"Have each, and to one another what"
9783,HERMES.,"Hostilities, attachments, and assemblings;"
9784,HERMES.,"The entrails' smoothness, and what color having"
9785,HERMES.,They would be to the divinities acceptable;
9786,HERMES.,"Of the gall and liver the various symmetry,"
9787,HERMES.,And the limbs concealed in fat; and the long
9788,HERMES.,"Flank burning, to an art hard to be guessed"
9789,HERMES.,I showed the way to mortals; and flammeous signs
9790,HERMES.,"Explained, before obscure."
9791,HERMES.,Such indeed these; and under ground
9792,HERMES.,Concealed the helps to men;
9793,HERMES.,"Brass, iron, silver, gold, who"
9794,HERMES.,Would affirm that he discovered before me?
9795,HERMES.,"None, I well know, not wishing in vain to boast."
9796,HERMES.,"But learn all in one word,"
9797,HERMES.,_All arts to mortals from Prometheus_.
9798,HERMES.,
9799,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Assist not mortals now unseasonably,"
9800,HERMES.,And neglect yourself unfortunate; for I
9801,HERMES.,"Am of good hope that, from these bonds"
9802,HERMES.,"Released, you will yet have no less power than Zeus."
9803,HERMES.,
9804,HERMES.,_Pr._ Never thus has Fate the Accomplisher
9805,HERMES.,"Decreed to fulfill these things, but by a myriad ills"
9806,HERMES.,"And woes subdued, thus bonds I flee;"
9807,HERMES.,For art 's far weaker than necessity.
9808,HERMES.,
9809,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Who, then, is helmsman of necessity?"
9810,HERMES.,
9811,HERMES.,"_Pr._ The Fates three-formed, and the remembering Furies."
9812,HERMES.,
9813,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Than these, then, is Zeus weaker?"
9814,HERMES.,
9815,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Ay, he could not escape what has been fated."
9816,HERMES.,
9817,HERMES.,"_Ch._ But what to Zeus is fated, except always to rule?"
9818,HERMES.,
9819,HERMES.,_Pr._ This thou wilt not learn; seek not to know.
9820,HERMES.,
9821,HERMES.,_Ch._ Surely some awful thing it is which you withhold.
9822,HERMES.,
9823,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Remember other words, for this by no means"
9824,HERMES.,"Is it time to tell, but to be concealed"
9825,HERMES.,As much as possible; for keeping this do I
9826,HERMES.,Escape unseemly bonds and woes.
9827,HERMES.,
9828,HERMES.,_Ch._ Never may the all-ruling
9829,HERMES.,Zeus put into my mind
9830,HERMES.,Force antagonist to him.
9831,HERMES.,Nor let me cease drawing near
9832,HERMES.,The gods with holy sacrifices
9833,HERMES.,"Of slain oxen, by Father Ocean's"
9834,HERMES.,"Ceaseless passage,"
9835,HERMES.,"Nor offend with words,"
9836,HERMES.,But in me this remain
9837,HERMES.,And ne'er be melted out.
9838,HERMES.,'Tis something sweet with bold
9839,HERMES.,Hopes the long life to
9840,HERMES.,"Extend, in bright"
9841,HERMES.,Cheerfulness the cherishing spirit.
9842,HERMES.,"But I shudder, thee beholding"
9843,HERMES.,By a myriad sufferings tormented....
9844,HERMES.,"For, not fearing Zeus,"
9845,HERMES.,In thy private mind thou dost regard
9846,HERMES.,"Mortals too much, Prometheus."
9847,HERMES.,"Come, though a thankless"
9848,HERMES.,"Favor, friend, say where is any strength,"
9849,HERMES.,From ephemerals any help? Saw you not
9850,HERMES.,"The powerless inefficiency,"
9851,HERMES.,"Dream-like, in which the blind ..."
9852,HERMES.,Race of mortals are entangled?
9853,HERMES.,Never counsels of mortals
9854,HERMES.,May transgress the harmony of Zeus.
9855,HERMES.,I learned these things looking on
9856,HERMES.,"Thy destructive fate, Prometheus."
9857,HERMES.,"For different to me did this strain come,"
9858,HERMES.,And that which round thy baths
9859,HERMES.,"And couch I hymned,"
9860,HERMES.,"With the design of marriage, when my father's child"
9861,HERMES.,"With bridal gifts persuading, thou didst lead"
9862,HERMES.,Hesione the partner of thy bed.
9863,HERMES.,
9864,HERMES.,"PROMETHEUS, CHORUS, _and_ IO."
9865,HERMES.,
9866,HERMES.,"_Io._ What earth, what race, what being shall I is this"
9867,HERMES.,I see in bridles of rock
9868,HERMES.,Exposed? By what crime's
9869,HERMES.,"Penalty dost thou perish? Show, to what part"
9870,HERMES.,Of earth I miserable have wandered.
9871,HERMES.,Ah! ah! alas! alas!
9872,HERMES.,"Again some fly doth sting me wretched,"
9873,HERMES.,"Image of earth-born Argus, cover it, earth;"
9874,HERMES.,I fear the myriad-eyed herdsman beholding;
9875,HERMES.,"For he goes having a treacherous eye,"
9876,HERMES.,Whom not e'en dead the earth conceals.
9877,HERMES.,"But me, wretched from the Infernals passing,"
9878,HERMES.,"He pursues, and drives fasting along the seaside"
9879,HERMES.,"Sand, while low resounds a wax-compacted reed,"
9880,HERMES.,Uttering sleep-giving law; alas! alas! O gods!
9881,HERMES.,"Where, gods! where lead me far-wandering courses?"
9882,HERMES.,"In what sin, O son of Kronos,"
9883,HERMES.,"In what sin ever having taken,"
9884,HERMES.,To these afflictions hast thou yoked me? alas! alas!
9885,HERMES.,With fly-driven fear a wretched
9886,HERMES.,Frenzied one dost thus afflict?
9887,HERMES.,"With fire burn, or with earth cover, or"
9888,HERMES.,"To sea monsters give for food, nor"
9889,HERMES.,"Envy me my prayers, king."
9890,HERMES.,Enough much-wandered wanderings
9891,HERMES.,"Have exercised me, nor can I learn where"
9892,HERMES.,I shall escape from sufferings.
9893,HERMES.,
9894,HERMES.,_Ch._ Hear'st thou the address of the cow-horned virgin?
9895,HERMES.,
9896,HERMES.,"_Pr._ And how not hear the fly-whirled virgin,"
9897,HERMES.,"Daughter of Inachus, who Zeus' heart warmed"
9898,HERMES.,"With love, and now the courses over long,"
9899,HERMES.,"By Here hated, forcedly performs?"
9900,HERMES.,
9901,HERMES.,_Io._ Whence utterest thou my father's name?
9902,HERMES.,"Tell me, miserable, who thou art,"
9903,HERMES.,"That to me, O suffering one, me born to suffer,"
9904,HERMES.,Thus true things dost address?
9905,HERMES.,"The god-sent ail thou'st named,"
9906,HERMES.,Which wastes me stinging
9907,HERMES.,"With maddening goads, alas! alas!"
9908,HERMES.,With foodless and unseemly leaps
9909,HERMES.,"Rushing headlong, I came,"
9910,HERMES.,By wrathful plots subdued.
9911,HERMES.,"Who of the wretched, who, alas! alas! suffers like me?"
9912,HERMES.,But to me clearly show
9913,HERMES.,"What me awaits to suffer,"
9914,HERMES.,"What not necessary; what remedy of ill,"
9915,HERMES.,"Teach, if indeed thou know'st; speak out,"
9916,HERMES.,Tell the ill-wandering virgin.
9917,HERMES.,
9918,HERMES.,_Pr._ I'll clearly tell thee all you wish to learn.
9919,HERMES.,"Not weaving in enigmas, but in simple speech,"
9920,HERMES.,As it is just to open the mouth to friends.
9921,HERMES.,"Thou seest the giver of fire to men, Prometheus."
9922,HERMES.,
9923,HERMES.,"_Io._ O thou who didst appear a common help to mortals,"
9924,HERMES.,"Wretched Prometheus, to atone for what do you endure this?"
9925,HERMES.,
9926,HERMES.,_Pr._ I have scarce ceased my sufferings lamenting.
9927,HERMES.,
9928,HERMES.,_Io._ Would you not grant this favor to me?
9929,HERMES.,
9930,HERMES.,_Pr._ Say what you ask; for you'd learn all from me.
9931,HERMES.,
9932,HERMES.,_Io._ Say who has bound thee to the cliff.
9933,HERMES.,
9934,HERMES.,"_Pr._ The will, indeed, of Zeus, Hephaistus' hand."
9935,HERMES.,
9936,HERMES.,_Io._ And penalty for what crimes dost thou pay?
9937,HERMES.,
9938,HERMES.,_Pr._ Thus much only can I show thee.
9939,HERMES.,
9940,HERMES.,"_Io._ But beside this, declare what time will be"
9941,HERMES.,To me unfortunate the limit of my wandering.
9942,HERMES.,
9943,HERMES.,_Pr._ Not to learn is better for thee than to learn these things.
9944,HERMES.,
9945,HERMES.,_Io._ Conceal not from me what I am to suffer.
9946,HERMES.,
9947,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Indeed, I grudge thee not this favor."
9948,HERMES.,
9949,HERMES.,"_Io._ Why, then, dost thou delay to tell the whole?"
9950,HERMES.,
9951,HERMES.,"_Pr._ There's no unwillingness, but I hesitate to vex thy mind."
9952,HERMES.,
9953,HERMES.,_Io._ Care not for me more than is pleasant to me.
9954,HERMES.,
9955,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Since you are earnest, it behooves to speak; hear then."
9956,HERMES.,
9957,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Not yet, indeed; but a share of pleasure also give to me."
9958,HERMES.,"First we'll learn the malady of this one,"
9959,HERMES.,"Herself relating her destructive fortunes,"
9960,HERMES.,And the remainder of her trials let her learn from thee.
9961,HERMES.,
9962,HERMES.,"_Pr._ 'T is thy part, Io, to do these a favor,"
9963,HERMES.,"As well for every other reason, and as they are sisters of thy"
9964,HERMES.,father.
9965,HERMES.,"Since to weep and to lament misfortunes,"
9966,HERMES.,There where one will get a tear
9967,HERMES.,"From those attending, is worthy the delay."
9968,HERMES.,
9969,HERMES.,"_Io._ I know not that I need distrust you,"
9970,HERMES.,But in plain speech you shall learn
9971,HERMES.,All that you ask for; and yet e'en telling I lament
9972,HERMES.,"The god-sent tempest, and dissolution"
9973,HERMES.,Of my form--whence to me miserable it came.
9974,HERMES.,"For always visions in the night, moving about"
9975,HERMES.,"My virgin chambers, enticed me"
9976,HERMES.,"With smooth words: ""O greatly happy virgin,"
9977,HERMES.,Why be a virgin long? is permitted to obtain
9978,HERMES.,The greatest marriage. For Zeus with love's dart
9979,HERMES.,"Has been warmed by thee, and wishes to unite"
9980,HERMES.,"In love; but do thou, O child, spurn not the couch"
9981,HERMES.,"Of Zeus, but go out to Lerna's deep"
9982,HERMES.,"Morass, and stables of thy father's herds,"
9983,HERMES.,"That the divine eye may cease from desire."""
9984,HERMES.,With such dreams every night
9985,HERMES.,"Was I unfortunate distressed, till I dared tell"
9986,HERMES.,My father of the night-wandering visions.
9987,HERMES.,And he to Pytho and Dodona frequent
9988,HERMES.,"Prophets sent, that he might learn what it was necessary"
9989,HERMES.,"He should say or do, to do agreeably to the gods."
9990,HERMES.,And they came bringing ambiguous
9991,HERMES.,"Oracles, darkly and indistinctly uttered."
9992,HERMES.,"But finally a plain report came to Inachus,"
9993,HERMES.,Clearly enjoining him and telling
9994,HERMES.,"Out of my home and country to expel me,"
9995,HERMES.,Discharged to wander to the earth's last bounds;
9996,HERMES.,"And if he was not willing, from Zeus would come"
9997,HERMES.,"A fiery thunderbolt, which would annihilate all his race."
9998,HERMES.,"Induced by such predictions of the Loxian,"
9999,HERMES.,"Against his will he drove me out,"
10000,HERMES.,And shut me from the houses; but Zeus' rein
10001,HERMES.,Compelled him by force to do these things.
10002,HERMES.,Immediately my form and mind were
10003,HERMES.,"Changed, and horned, as you behold, stung"
10004,HERMES.,"By a sharp-mouthed fly, with frantic leaping"
10005,HERMES.,"Rushed I to Cenchrea's palatable stream,"
10006,HERMES.,And Lerna's source; but a herdsman born-of-earth
10007,HERMES.,"Of violent temper, Argus, accompanied, with numerous"
10008,HERMES.,Eyes my steps observing.
10009,HERMES.,But unexpectedly a sudden fate
10010,HERMES.,"Robbed him of life; and I, fly-stung,"
10011,HERMES.,By lash divine am driven from land to land.
10012,HERMES.,"You hear what has been done; and if you have to say aught,"
10013,HERMES.,"What's left of labors, speak; nor pitying me"
10014,HERMES.,Comfort with false words; for an ill
10015,HERMES.,"The worst of all, I say, are made-up words."
10016,HERMES.,
10017,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Ah! ah! enough, alas!"
10018,HERMES.,"Ne'er, ne'er did I presume such cruel words"
10019,HERMES.,"Would reach my ears, nor thus unsightly"
10020,HERMES.,"And intolerable hurts, sufferings, fears with a two-edged"
10021,HERMES.,Goad would chill my soul;
10022,HERMES.,Alas! alas! fate! fate!
10023,HERMES.,"I shudder, seeing the state of Io."
10024,HERMES.,
10025,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Beforehand sigh'st thou, and art full of fears,"
10026,HERMES.,Hold till the rest also thou learn'st.
10027,HERMES.,
10028,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Tell, teach; for to the sick 't is sweet"
10029,HERMES.,To know the remaining pain beforehand clearly.
10030,HERMES.,
10031,HERMES.,_Pr._ Your former wish ye got from me
10032,HERMES.,With ease; for first ye asked to learn from her
10033,HERMES.,Relating her own trials;
10034,HERMES.,"The rest now hear, what sufferings 't is necessary"
10035,HERMES.,This young woman should endure from Here.
10036,HERMES.,"But do thou, offspring of Inachus, my words"
10037,HERMES.,"Cast in thy mind, that thou may'st learn the boundaries of"
10038,HERMES.,the way.
10039,HERMES.,"First, indeed, hence towards the rising of the sun"
10040,HERMES.,"Turning thyself, travel uncultivated lands,"
10041,HERMES.,"And to the Scythian nomads thou wilt come, who woven roofs"
10042,HERMES.,"On high inhabit, on well-wheeled carts,"
10043,HERMES.,With far-casting bows equipped;
10044,HERMES.,"Whom go not near, but to the sea-resounding cliffs"
10045,HERMES.,"Bending thy feet, pass from the region."
10046,HERMES.,On the left hand the iron-working
10047,HERMES.,"Chalybes inhabit, whom thou must needs beware,"
10048,HERMES.,For they are rude and inaccessible to strangers.
10049,HERMES.,"And thou wilt come to the Hybristes river, not ill named,"
10050,HERMES.,"Which pass not, for not easy is 't to pass,"
10051,HERMES.,"Before you get to Caucasus itself, highest"
10052,HERMES.,"Of mountains, where the stream spurts out its tide"
10053,HERMES.,From the very temples; and passing over
10054,HERMES.,"The star-neighbored summits, 't is necessary to go"
10055,HERMES.,"The southern way, where thou wilt come to the man-hating"
10056,HERMES.,"Army of the Amazons, who Themiscyra one day"
10057,HERMES.,"Will inhabit, by the Thermedon, where's"
10058,HERMES.,"Salmydessia, rough jaw of the sea,"
10059,HERMES.,"Inhospitable to sailors, stepmother of ships;"
10060,HERMES.,"They will conduct thee on thy way, and very cheerfully."
10061,HERMES.,"And to the Cimmerian isthmus thou wilt come,"
10062,HERMES.,"Just on the narrow portals of a lake, which leaving"
10063,HERMES.,It behooves thee with stout heart to pass the Moeotic straits;
10064,HERMES.,And there will be to mortals ever a great fame
10065,HERMES.,"Of thy passage, and Bosphorus from thy name"
10066,HERMES.,'T will be called. And leaving Europe's plain
10067,HERMES.,"The continent of Asia thou wilt reach.--Seemeth to thee,"
10068,HERMES.,"forsooth,"
10069,HERMES.,The tyrant of the gods in everything to be
10070,HERMES.,"Thus violent? For he a god, with this mortal"
10071,HERMES.,"Wishing to unite, drove her to these wanderings."
10072,HERMES.,"A bitter wooer didst thou find, O virgin,"
10073,HERMES.,For thy marriage. For the words you now have heard
10074,HERMES.,Think not yet to be the prelude.
10075,HERMES.,
10076,HERMES.,_Io._ Ah! me! me! alas! alas!
10077,HERMES.,
10078,HERMES.,_Pr._ Again dost shriek and heave a sigh? What
10079,HERMES.,Wilt thou do when the remaining ills thou learn'st?
10080,HERMES.,
10081,HERMES.,_Ch._ And hast thou any further suffering to tell her?
10082,HERMES.,
10083,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Ay, a tempestuous sea of baleful woe."
10084,HERMES.,
10085,HERMES.,"_Io._ What profit, then, for me to live, and not in haste"
10086,HERMES.,"To cast myself from this rough rock,"
10087,HERMES.,That rushing down upon the plain I may be released
10088,HERMES.,"From every trouble? For better once for all to die,"
10089,HERMES.,Than all my days to suffer evilly.
10090,HERMES.,
10091,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Unhappily my trials would'st thou hear,"
10092,HERMES.,To whom to die has not been fated;
10093,HERMES.,For this would be release from sufferings;
10094,HERMES.,But now there is no end of ills lying
10095,HERMES.,"Before me, until Zeus falls from sovereignty."
10096,HERMES.,
10097,HERMES.,_Io._ And is Zeus ever to fall from power?
10098,HERMES.,
10099,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Thou would'st be pleased, I think, to see this accident."
10100,HERMES.,
10101,HERMES.,"_Io._ How should I not, who suffer ill from Zeus?"
10102,HERMES.,
10103,HERMES.,"_Pr._ That these things then are so, be thou assured."
10104,HERMES.,
10105,HERMES.,_Io._ By what one will the tyrant's power be robbed?
10106,HERMES.,
10107,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Himself, by his own senseless counsels."
10108,HERMES.,
10109,HERMES.,"_Io._ In what way show, if there's no harm."
10110,HERMES.,
10111,HERMES.,_Pr._ He will make such a marriage as one day he'll repent.
10112,HERMES.,
10113,HERMES.,"_Io._ Of god or mortal? If to be spoken, tell."
10114,HERMES.,
10115,HERMES.,_Pr._ What matters which? For these things are not to be told.
10116,HERMES.,
10117,HERMES.,_Io._ By a wife will he be driven from the throne?
10118,HERMES.,
10119,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Ay, she will bring forth a son superior to his father."
10120,HERMES.,
10121,HERMES.,_Io._ Is there no refuge for him from this fate?
10122,HERMES.,
10123,HERMES.,"_Pr._ None, surely, till I may be released from bonds."
10124,HERMES.,
10125,HERMES.,"_Io._ Who, then, is to release thee, Zeus unwilling?"
10126,HERMES.,
10127,HERMES.,_Pr._ He must be some one of thy descendants.
10128,HERMES.,
10129,HERMES.,_Io._ How sayest thou? that my child will deliver thee from ills?
10130,HERMES.,
10131,HERMES.,_Pr._ Third of thy race after ten other births.
10132,HERMES.,
10133,HERMES.,_Io._ This oracle is not yet easy to be guessed.
10134,HERMES.,
10135,HERMES.,_Pr._ But do not seek to understand thy sufferings.
10136,HERMES.,
10137,HERMES.,"_Io._ First proffering gain to me, do not then withhold it."
10138,HERMES.,
10139,HERMES.,_Pr._ I'll grant thee one of two relations.
10140,HERMES.,
10141,HERMES.,"_Io._ What two propose, and give to me my choice."
10142,HERMES.,
10143,HERMES.,_Pr._ I give; choose whether thy remaining troubles
10144,HERMES.,"I shall tell thee clearly, or him that will release me."
10145,HERMES.,
10146,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Consent to do her the one favor,"
10147,HERMES.,"Me the other, nor deem us undeserving of thy words;"
10148,HERMES.,"To her indeed tell what remains of wandering,"
10149,HERMES.,"And to me, who will release; for I desire this."
10150,HERMES.,
10151,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Since ye are earnest, I will not resist"
10152,HERMES.,"To tell the whole, as much as ye ask for."
10153,HERMES.,"To thee first, Io, vexatious wandering I will tell,"
10154,HERMES.,Which engrave on the remembering tablets of the mind.
10155,HERMES.,"When thou hast passed the flood boundary of continents,"
10156,HERMES.,Towards the flaming orient sun-traveled ...
10157,HERMES.,"Passing through the tumult of the sea, until you reach"
10158,HERMES.,"The Gorgonian plains of Cisthene, where"
10159,HERMES.,"The Phorcides dwell, old virgins,"
10160,HERMES.,"Three, swan-shaped, having a common eye,"
10161,HERMES.,"One-toothed, whom neither the sun looks on"
10162,HERMES.,"With his beams, nor nightly moon ever."
10163,HERMES.,"And near, their winged sisters three,"
10164,HERMES.,"Dragon-scaled Gorgons, odious to men,"
10165,HERMES.,Whom no mortal beholding will have breath;
10166,HERMES.,Such danger do I tell thee.
10167,HERMES.,But hear another odious sight;
10168,HERMES.,"Beware the gryphons, sharp-mouthed"
10169,HERMES.,"Dogs of Zeus, which bark not, and the one-eyed Arimaspian"
10170,HERMES.,"Host, going on horseback, who dwell about"
10171,HERMES.,The golden-flowing flood of Pluto's channel;
10172,HERMES.,These go not near. But to a distant land
10173,HERMES.,"Thou 'lt come, a dusky race, who near the fountains"
10174,HERMES.,"Of the sun inhabit, where is the Æthiopian river."
10175,HERMES.,"Creep down the banks of this, until thou com'st"
10176,HERMES.,"To a descent, where from Byblinian mounts"
10177,HERMES.,The Nile sends down its sacred palatable stream.
10178,HERMES.,This will conduct thee to the triangled land
10179,HERMES.,"Nilean, where, Io, 't is decreed"
10180,HERMES.,Thou and thy progeny shall form the distant colony.
10181,HERMES.,"If aught of this is unintelligible to thee, and hard to be"
10182,HERMES.,"found out,"
10183,HERMES.,"Repeat thy questions, and learn clearly;"
10184,HERMES.,For more leisure than I want is granted me.
10185,HERMES.,
10186,HERMES.,_Ch._ If to her aught remaining or omitted
10187,HERMES.,"Thou hast to tell of her pernicious wandering,"
10188,HERMES.,"Speak; but if thou hast said all, give us"
10189,HERMES.,"The favor which we ask, for surely thou remember'st."
10190,HERMES.,
10191,HERMES.,_Pr._ The whole term of her traveling has she heard.
10192,HERMES.,"But that she may know that not in vain she hears me,"
10193,HERMES.,"I'll tell what before coming hither she endured,"
10194,HERMES.,Giving this as proof of my relations.
10195,HERMES.,"The great multitude of words I will omit,"
10196,HERMES.,And proceed unto the very limit of thy wanderings.
10197,HERMES.,"When, then, you came to the Molossian ground,"
10198,HERMES.,"And near the high-ridged Dodona, where"
10199,HERMES.,"Oracle and seat is of Thesprotian Zeus,"
10200,HERMES.,"And prodigy incredible, the speaking oaks,"
10201,HERMES.,"By whom you clearly, and naught enigmatically,"
10202,HERMES.,Were called the illustrious wife of Zeus
10203,HERMES.,"About to be, if aught of these things soothes thee;"
10204,HERMES.,"Thence, driven by the fly, you came"
10205,HERMES.,"The seaside way to the great gulf of Rhea,"
10206,HERMES.,From which by courses retrograde you are now tempest-tossed.
10207,HERMES.,"But for time to come the sea gulf,"
10208,HERMES.,"Clearly know, will be called Ionian,"
10209,HERMES.,Memorial of thy passage to all mortals.
10210,HERMES.,"Proofs to thee are these of my intelligence,"
10211,HERMES.,That it sees somewhat more than the apparent.
10212,HERMES.,"But the rest to you and her in common I will tell,"
10213,HERMES.,Having come upon the very track of former words.
10214,HERMES.,"There is a city Canopus, last of the land,"
10215,HERMES.,By Nile's very mouth and bank;
10216,HERMES.,"There at length Zeus makes thee sane,"
10217,HERMES.,"Stroking with gentle hand, and touching only."
10218,HERMES.,"And, named from Zeus' begetting,"
10219,HERMES.,"Thou wilt bear dark Epaphus, who will reap"
10220,HERMES.,As much land as broad-flowing Nile doth water;
10221,HERMES.,"And fifth from him, a band of fifty children"
10222,HERMES.,"Again to Argos shall unwilling come,"
10223,HERMES.,"Of female sex, avoiding kindred marriage"
10224,HERMES.,"Of their cousins; but they, with minds inflamed,"
10225,HERMES.,"Hawks by doves not far left behind,"
10226,HERMES.,Will come pursuing marriages
10227,HERMES.,"Not to be pursued, but heaven will take vengeance on their bodies;"
10228,HERMES.,For them Pelasgia shall receive by Mars
10229,HERMES.,Subdued with woman's hand with night-watching boldness.
10230,HERMES.,"For each wife shall take her husband's life,"
10231,HERMES.,Staining a two-edged dagger in his throat.
10232,HERMES.,Such 'gainst my foes may Cypris come.--
10233,HERMES.,But one of the daughters shall love soften
10234,HERMES.,"Not to slay her bedfellow, but she will waver"
10235,HERMES.,"In her mind; and one of two things will prefer,"
10236,HERMES.,"To hear herself called timid, rather than stained with blood;"
10237,HERMES.,She shall in Argos bear a royal race.--
10238,HERMES.,Of a long speech is need this clearly to discuss.
10239,HERMES.,"From this seed, however, shall be born a brave,"
10240,HERMES.,"Famed for his bow, who will release me"
10241,HERMES.,From these sufferings. Such oracle my ancient
10242,HERMES.,"Mother told me, Titanian Themis;"
10243,HERMES.,"But how and by what means, this needs long speech"
10244,HERMES.,"To tell, and nothing, learning, wilt thou gain."
10245,HERMES.,
10246,HERMES.,_Io._ Ah me! ah wretched me!
10247,HERMES.,Spasms again and brain-struck
10248,HERMES.,"Madness burn me within, and a fly's dart"
10249,HERMES.,"Stings me,--not wrought by fire."
10250,HERMES.,"My heart with fear knocks at my breast,"
10251,HERMES.,"And my eyes whirl round and round,"
10252,HERMES.,And from my course I'm borne by madness'
10253,HERMES.,"Furious breath, unable to control my tongue;"
10254,HERMES.,While confused words dash idly
10255,HERMES.,'Gainst the waves of horrid woe.
10256,HERMES.,
10257,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Wise, wise indeed was he,"
10258,HERMES.,Who first in mind
10259,HERMES.,"This weighed, and with the tongue expressed,"
10260,HERMES.,To marry according to one's degree is best by far;
10261,HERMES.,"Nor, being a laborer with the hands,"
10262,HERMES.,"To woo those who are by wealth corrupted,"
10263,HERMES.,"Nor, those by birth made great."
10264,HERMES.,"Never, never me"
10265,HERMES.,Fates ...
10266,HERMES.,May you behold the sharer of Zeus' couch.
10267,HERMES.,"Nor may I be brought near to any husband among those from heaven,"
10268,HERMES.,"For I fear, seeing the virginhood of Io,"
10269,HERMES.,"Not content with man, through marriage vexed"
10270,HERMES.,With these distressful wanderings by Here.
10271,HERMES.,"But for myself, since an equal marriage is without fear,"
10272,HERMES.,I am not concerned lest the love of the almighty
10273,HERMES.,Gods cast its inevitable eye on me.
10274,HERMES.,"Without war, indeed, this war, producing"
10275,HERMES.,Troubles; nor do I know what would become of me;
10276,HERMES.,For I see not how I should escape the subtlety of Zeus.
10277,HERMES.,
10278,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Surely shall Zeus, though haughty now,"
10279,HERMES.,"Yet be humble, such marriage"
10280,HERMES.,"He prepares to make, which from sovereignty"
10281,HERMES.,And the throne will cast him down obscure; and Father Kronos'
10282,HERMES.,"Curse will then be all fulfilled,"
10283,HERMES.,Which falling from the ancient seats he imprecated.
10284,HERMES.,And refuge from such ills none of the gods
10285,HERMES.,But I can show him clearly.
10286,HERMES.,"I know these things, and in what manner. Now, therefore,"
10287,HERMES.,"Being bold, let him sit trusting to lofty"
10288,HERMES.,"Sounds, and brandishing with both hands his fire-breathing weapon,"
10289,HERMES.,"For naught will these avail him, not"
10290,HERMES.,To fall disgracefully intolerable falls;
10291,HERMES.,"Such wrestler does he now prepare,"
10292,HERMES.,"Himself against himself, a prodigy most hard to be withstood;"
10293,HERMES.,"Who, indeed, will invent a better flame than lightning,"
10294,HERMES.,And a loud sound surpassing thunder;
10295,HERMES.,"And shiver the trident, Neptune's weapon,"
10296,HERMES.,The marine earth-shaking ail.
10297,HERMES.,Stumbling upon this ill he'll learn
10298,HERMES.,How different to govern and to serve.
10299,HERMES.,
10300,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Ay, as you hope you vent this against Zeus."
10301,HERMES.,
10302,HERMES.,"_Pr._ What will be done, and also what I hope, I say."
10303,HERMES.,
10304,HERMES.,_Ch._ And are we to expect that any will rule Zeus?
10305,HERMES.,
10306,HERMES.,_Pr._ Even than these more grievous ills he'll have.
10307,HERMES.,
10308,HERMES.,"_Ch._ How fear'st thou not, hurling such words?"
10309,HERMES.,
10310,HERMES.,"_Pr._ What should I fear, to whom to die has not been fated?"
10311,HERMES.,
10312,HERMES.,_Ch._ But suffering more grievous still than this he may inflict.
10313,HERMES.,
10314,HERMES.,_Pr._ Then let him do it; all is expected by me.
10315,HERMES.,
10316,HERMES.,_Ch._ Those reverencing Adrastia are wise.
10317,HERMES.,
10318,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Revere, pray, flatter each successive ruler."
10319,HERMES.,Me less than nothing Zeus concerns.
10320,HERMES.,"Let him do, let him prevail this short time"
10321,HERMES.,"As he will, for long he will not rule the gods,--"
10322,HERMES.,"But I see here, indeed, Zeus' runner,"
10323,HERMES.,The new tryant's drudge;
10324,HERMES.,Doubtless he brings some new message.
10325,HERMES.,
10326,HERMES.,"PROMETHEUS, CHORUS, _and_ HERMES."
10327,HERMES.,
10328,HERMES.,"_Her._ To thee, the sophist, the bitterly bitter,"
10329,HERMES.,"The sinner against gods, the giver of honors"
10330,HERMES.,"To ephemerals, the thief of fire, I speak;"
10331,HERMES.,The Father commands thee to tell the marriage
10332,HERMES.,"Which you boast, by which he falls from power;"
10333,HERMES.,"And that, too, not enigmatically,"
10334,HERMES.,But each particular declare; nor cause me
10335,HERMES.,"Double journeys, Prometheus; for thou see'st that"
10336,HERMES.,Zeus is not appeased by such.
10337,HERMES.,
10338,HERMES.,_Pr._ Solemn-mouthed and full of wisdom
10339,HERMES.,"Is thy speech, as of the servant of the gods."
10340,HERMES.,"Ye newly rule, and think forsooth"
10341,HERMES.,To dwell in griefless citadels; have I not seen
10342,HERMES.,Two tyrants fallen from these?
10343,HERMES.,"And third I shall behold him ruling now,"
10344,HERMES.,Basest and speediest. Do I seem to thee
10345,HERMES.,To fear and shrink from the new gods?
10346,HERMES.,"Nay, much and wholly I fall short of this."
10347,HERMES.,The way thou cam'st go through the dust again;
10348,HERMES.,For thou wilt learn naught which thou ask'st of me.
10349,HERMES.,
10350,HERMES.,"_Her._ Ay, by such insolence before"
10351,HERMES.,You brought yourself into these woes.
10352,HERMES.,
10353,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Plainly know, I would not change"
10354,HERMES.,"My ill fortune for thy servitude,"
10355,HERMES.,"For better, I think, to serve this rock"
10356,HERMES.,Than be the faithful messenger of Father Zeus.
10357,HERMES.,Thus to insult the insulting it is fit.
10358,HERMES.,
10359,HERMES.,_Her._ Thou seem'st to enjoy thy present state.
10360,HERMES.,
10361,HERMES.,_Pr._ I enjoy? Enjoying thus my enemies
10362,HERMES.,Would I see; and thee 'mong them I count.
10363,HERMES.,
10364,HERMES.,_Her._ Dost thou blame me for aught of thy misfortunes?
10365,HERMES.,
10366,HERMES.,"_Pr._ In plain words, all gods I hate,"
10367,HERMES.,As many as well treated wrong me unjustly.
10368,HERMES.,
10369,HERMES.,"_Her._ I hear thee raving, no slight ail."
10370,HERMES.,
10371,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Ay, I should ail, if ail one's foes to hate."
10372,HERMES.,
10373,HERMES.,"_Her._ If prosperous, thou couldst not be borne."
10374,HERMES.,
10375,HERMES.,_Pr._ Ah me!
10376,HERMES.,
10377,HERMES.,_Her._ This word Zeus does not know.
10378,HERMES.,
10379,HERMES.,_Pr._ But time growing old teaches all things.
10380,HERMES.,
10381,HERMES.,_Her._ And still thou know'st not yet how to be prudent.
10382,HERMES.,
10383,HERMES.,_Pr._ For I should not converse with thee a servant.
10384,HERMES.,
10385,HERMES.,_Her._ Thou seem'st to say naught which the Father wishes.
10386,HERMES.,
10387,HERMES.,_Pr._ And yet his debtor I'd requite the favor.
10388,HERMES.,
10389,HERMES.,_Her._ Thou mock'st me verily as if I were a child.
10390,HERMES.,
10391,HERMES.,"_Pr._ And art thou not a child, and simpler still than this,"
10392,HERMES.,If thou expectest to learn aught from me?
10393,HERMES.,"There is not outrage nor expedient, by which"
10394,HERMES.,"Zeus will induce me to declare these things,"
10395,HERMES.,Before he loose these grievous bonds.
10396,HERMES.,"Let there be hurled, then, flaming fire,"
10397,HERMES.,"And the white-winged snows, and thunders"
10398,HERMES.,"Of the earth, let him confound and mingle all."
10399,HERMES.,For none of these will bend me till I tell
10400,HERMES.,By whom 't is necessary he should fall from sovereignty.
10401,HERMES.,
10402,HERMES.,_Her._ Consider now if these things seem helpful.
10403,HERMES.,
10404,HERMES.,_Pr._ Long since these were considered and resolved.
10405,HERMES.,
10406,HERMES.,"_Her._ Venture, O vain one, venture, at length,"
10407,HERMES.,In view of present sufferings to be wise.
10408,HERMES.,
10409,HERMES.,"_Pr._ In vain you vex me, as a wave, exhorting."
10410,HERMES.,"Ne'er let it come into thy mind that I, fearing"
10411,HERMES.,"Zeus' anger, shall become woman-minded,"
10412,HERMES.,"And beg him, greatly hated,"
10413,HERMES.,"With womanish upturnings of the hands,"
10414,HERMES.,To loose me from these bonds. I am far from it.
10415,HERMES.,
10416,HERMES.,_Her._ Though saying much I seem in vain to speak;
10417,HERMES.,For thou art nothing softened nor appeased
10418,HERMES.,By prayers; but champing at the bit like a new-yoked
10419,HERMES.,"Colt, thou strugglest and contend'st against the reins."
10420,HERMES.,But thou art violent with feeble wisdom.
10421,HERMES.,"For stubbornness to him who is not wise,"
10422,HERMES.,"Itself alone, is less than nothing strong."
10423,HERMES.,"But consider, if thou art not persuaded by my words,"
10424,HERMES.,What storm and triple surge of ills
10425,HERMES.,"Will come upon thee, not to be avoided; for first this rugged"
10426,HERMES.,Cliff with thunder and lightning flame
10427,HERMES.,"The Father'll rend, and hide"
10428,HERMES.,"Thy body, and a strong arm will bury thee."
10429,HERMES.,"When thou hast spent a long length of time,"
10430,HERMES.,Thou wilt come back to light; and Zeus'
10431,HERMES.,"Winged dog, a bloodthirsty eagle, ravenously"
10432,HERMES.,"Shall tear the great rag of thy body,"
10433,HERMES.,"Creeping an uninvited guest all day,"
10434,HERMES.,And banquet on thy liver black by eating.
10435,HERMES.,"Of such suffering expect not any end,"
10436,HERMES.,Before some god appear
10437,HERMES.,"Succeeding to thy labors, and wish to go to rayless"
10438,HERMES.,"Hades, and the dark depths of Tartarus."
10439,HERMES.,Therefore deliberate; since this is not made
10440,HERMES.,"Boasting, but in earnest spoken;"
10441,HERMES.,For to speak falsely does not know the mouth
10442,HERMES.,"Of Zeus, but every word he does. So"
10443,HERMES.,"Look about thee, and consider, nor ever think"
10444,HERMES.,Obstinacy better than prudence.
10445,HERMES.,
10446,HERMES.,"_Ch._ To us indeed Hermes appears to say not unseasonable things,"
10447,HERMES.,"For he directs thee, leaving off"
10448,HERMES.,"Self-will, to seek prudent counsel."
10449,HERMES.,"Obey; for it is base to err, for a wise man."
10450,HERMES.,
10451,HERMES.,_Pr._ To me foreknowing these messages
10452,HERMES.,"He has uttered, but for a foe to suffer ill"
10453,HERMES.,From foes is naught unseemly.
10454,HERMES.,Therefore 'gainst me let there be hurled
10455,HERMES.,"Fire's double-pointed curl, and air"
10456,HERMES.,"Be provoked with thunder, and a tumult"
10457,HERMES.,Of wild winds; and earth from its foundations
10458,HERMES.,"Let a wind rock, and its very roots,"
10459,HERMES.,And with a rough surge mingle
10460,HERMES.,The sea waves with the passages
10461,HERMES.,"Of the heavenly stars, and to black"
10462,HERMES.,Tartarus let him quite cast down my
10463,HERMES.,"Body, by necessity's strong eddies."
10464,HERMES.,Yet after all he will not kill me.
10465,HERMES.,
10466,HERMES.,_Her._ Such words and counsels you may hear
10467,HERMES.,From the brain-struck.
10468,HERMES.,For what lacks he of being mad?
10469,HERMES.,"And if prosperous, what does he cease from madness?"
10470,HERMES.,"Do you, therefore, who sympathize"
10471,HERMES.,"With this one's suffering,"
10472,HERMES.,"From these places quick withdraw somewhere,"
10473,HERMES.,Lest the harsh bellowing thunder
10474,HERMES.,Stupefy your minds.
10475,HERMES.,
10476,HERMES.,"_Ch._ Say something else, and exhort me"
10477,HERMES.,To some purpose; for surely
10478,HERMES.,Thou hast intolerably abused this word.
10479,HERMES.,How direct me to perform a baseness?
10480,HERMES.,"I wish to suffer with him whate'er is necessary,"
10481,HERMES.,For I have learned to hate betrayers;
10482,HERMES.,Nor is the pest
10483,HERMES.,Which I abominate more than this.
10484,HERMES.,
10485,HERMES.,"_Her._ Remember, then, what I foretell;"
10486,HERMES.,Nor by calamity pursued
10487,HERMES.,"Blame fortune, nor e'er say"
10488,HERMES.,That Zeus into unforeseen
10489,HERMES.,"Ill has cast you; surely not, but yourselves"
10490,HERMES.,"You yourselves; for knowing,"
10491,HERMES.,"And not suddenly nor clandestinely,"
10492,HERMES.,You'll be entangled through your folly
10493,HERMES.,In an impassable net of woe.
10494,HERMES.,
10495,HERMES.,"_Pr._ Surely indeed, and no more in word,"
10496,HERMES.,Earth is shaken;
10497,HERMES.,And a hoarse sound of thunder
10498,HERMES.,Bellows near; and wreaths of lightning
10499,HERMES.,"Flash out fiercely blazing, and whirlwinds dust"
10500,HERMES.,Whirl up; and leap the blasts
10501,HERMES.,"Of all winds, 'gainst one another"
10502,HERMES.,Blowing in opposite array;
10503,HERMES.,And air with sea is mingled;
10504,HERMES.,"Such impulse against me from Zeus,"
10505,HERMES.,"Producing fear, doth plainly come."
10506,HERMES.,"O revered Mother, O Ether"
10507,HERMES.,"Revolving common light to all,"
10508,HERMES.,"You see me, how unjust things I endure!"

11176,INSPIRATION[8],"Listening behind me for my wit,"
11177,INSPIRATION[8],"With faith superior to hope,"
11178,INSPIRATION[8],"More anxious to keep back than forward it,"
11179,INSPIRATION[8],
11180,INSPIRATION[8],Making my soul accomplice there
11181,INSPIRATION[8],"Unto the flame my heart hath lit,"
11182,INSPIRATION[8],"Then will the verse forever wear,--"
11183,INSPIRATION[8],Time cannot bend the line which God hath writ.
11184,INSPIRATION[8],
11185,INSPIRATION[8],Always the general show of things
11186,INSPIRATION[8],"Floats in review before my mind,"
11187,INSPIRATION[8],"And such true love and reverence brings,"
11188,INSPIRATION[8],That sometimes I forget that I am blind.
11189,INSPIRATION[8],
11190,INSPIRATION[8],"But now there comes unsought, unseen,"
11191,INSPIRATION[8],"Some clear divine electuary,"
11192,INSPIRATION[8],"And I, who had but sensual been,"
11193,INSPIRATION[8],"Grow sensible, and as God is, am wary."
11194,INSPIRATION[8],
11195,INSPIRATION[8],"I hearing get, who had but ears,"
11196,INSPIRATION[8],"And sight, who had but eyes before;"
11197,INSPIRATION[8],"I moments live, who lived but years,"
11198,INSPIRATION[8],"And truth discern, who knew but learning's lore."
11199,INSPIRATION[8],
11200,INSPIRATION[8],"I hear beyond the range of sound,"
11201,INSPIRATION[8],"I see beyond the range of sight,"
11202,INSPIRATION[8],"New earths and skies and seas around,"
11203,INSPIRATION[8],And in my day the sun doth pale his light.
11204,INSPIRATION[8],
11205,INSPIRATION[8],A clear and ancient harmony
11206,INSPIRATION[8],"Pierces my soul through all its din,"
11207,INSPIRATION[8],"As through its utmost melody,--"
11208,INSPIRATION[8],"Farther behind than they, farther within."
11209,INSPIRATION[8],
11210,INSPIRATION[8],More swift its bolt than lightning is.
11211,INSPIRATION[8],"Its voice than thunder is more loud,"
11212,INSPIRATION[8],It doth expand my privacies
11213,INSPIRATION[8],"To all, and leave me single in the crowd."
11214,INSPIRATION[8],
11215,INSPIRATION[8],"It speaks with such authority,"
11216,INSPIRATION[8],"With so serene and lofty tone,"
11217,INSPIRATION[8],"That idle Time runs gadding by,"
11218,INSPIRATION[8],And leaves me with Eternity alone.
11219,INSPIRATION[8],
11220,INSPIRATION[8],"Then chiefly is my natal hour,"
11221,INSPIRATION[8],And only then my prime of life;
11222,INSPIRATION[8],"Of manhood's strength it is the flower,"
11223,INSPIRATION[8],"'T is peace's end, and war's beginning strife."
11224,INSPIRATION[8],
11225,INSPIRATION[8],"'T hath come in summer's broadest noon,"
11226,INSPIRATION[8],"By a gray wall or some chance place,"
11227,INSPIRATION[8],"Unseasoned time, insulted June,"
11228,INSPIRATION[8],And vexed the day with its presuming face.
11229,INSPIRATION[8],
11230,INSPIRATION[8],"Such fragrance round my couch it makes,"
11231,INSPIRATION[8],"More rich than are Arabian drugs,"
11232,INSPIRATION[8],That my soul scents its life and wakes
11233,INSPIRATION[8],The body up beneath its perfumed rugs.
11234,INSPIRATION[8],
11235,INSPIRATION[8],"Such is the Muse, the heavenly maid,"
11236,INSPIRATION[8],"The star that guides our mortal course,"
11237,INSPIRATION[8],"Which shows where life's true kernel's laid,"
11238,INSPIRATION[8],"Its wheat's fine flour, and its undying force."
11239,INSPIRATION[8],
11240,INSPIRATION[8],"She with one breath attunes the spheres,"
11241,INSPIRATION[8],"And also my poor human heart,"
11242,INSPIRATION[8],With one impulse propels the years
11243,INSPIRATION[8],"Around, and gives my throbbing pulse its start."
11244,INSPIRATION[8],
11245,INSPIRATION[8],"I will not doubt for evermore,"
11246,INSPIRATION[8],"Nor falter from a steadfast faith,"
11247,INSPIRATION[8],"For though the system be turned o'er,"
11248,INSPIRATION[8],God takes not back the word which once he saith.
11249,INSPIRATION[8],
11250,INSPIRATION[8],"I will, then, trust the love untold"
11251,INSPIRATION[8],"Which not my worth nor want has bought,"
11252,INSPIRATION[8],"Which wooed me young, and wooes me old,"
11253,INSPIRATION[8],And to this evening hath me brought.
11254,INSPIRATION[8],
11255,INSPIRATION[8],My memory I'll educate
11256,INSPIRATION[8],"To know the one historic truth,"
11257,INSPIRATION[8],Remembering to the latest date
11258,INSPIRATION[8],The only true and sole immortal youth.
11259,INSPIRATION[8],
11260,INSPIRATION[8],"Be but thy inspiration given,"
11261,INSPIRATION[8],"No matter through what danger sought,"
11262,INSPIRATION[8],"I'll fathom hell or climb to heaven,"
11263,INSPIRATION[8],And yet esteem that cheap which love has bought.

11555,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],"Small birds, in fleets migrating by,"

11582,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],But with as brave a core within
11583,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],They rear their boughs to the October sky.
11584,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],
11585,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],Poor knights they are which bravely wait
11586,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],"The charge of Winter's cavalry,"
11587,THE FALL OF THE LEAF[12],"Keeping a simple Roman state,"

11731,THE DEPARTURE,In this covert I have hidden;
11732,THE DEPARTURE,"Friendly thoughts were cliffs to me,"
11733,THE DEPARTURE,And I hid beneath their lee.
11734,THE DEPARTURE,
11735,THE DEPARTURE,"This true people took the stranger,"
11736,THE DEPARTURE,And warm-hearted housed the ranger;
11737,THE DEPARTURE,"They received their roving guest,"
11738,THE DEPARTURE,And have fed him with the best;
11739,THE DEPARTURE,
11740,THE DEPARTURE,Whatsoe'er the land afforded
11741,THE DEPARTURE,To the stranger's wish accorded;
11742,THE DEPARTURE,"Shook the olive, stripped the vine,"
11743,THE DEPARTURE,And expressed the strengthening wine.
11744,THE DEPARTURE,
11745,THE DEPARTURE,And by night they did spread o'er him
11746,THE DEPARTURE,What by day they spread before him;--
11747,THE DEPARTURE,That good-will which was repast
11748,THE DEPARTURE,Was his covering at last.
11749,THE DEPARTURE,
11750,THE DEPARTURE,The stranger moored him to their pier
11751,THE DEPARTURE,Without anxiety or fear;
11752,THE DEPARTURE,"By day he walked the sloping land,"
11753,THE DEPARTURE,By night the gentle heavens he scanned.
11754,THE DEPARTURE,
11755,THE DEPARTURE,When first his bark stood inland
11756,THE DEPARTURE,"To the coast of that far Finland,"
11757,THE DEPARTURE,Sweet-watered brooks came tumbling to the shore
11758,THE DEPARTURE,The weary mariner to restore.
11759,THE DEPARTURE,
11760,THE DEPARTURE,And still he stayed from day to day
11761,THE DEPARTURE,If he their kindness might repay;
11762,THE DEPARTURE,But more and more
11763,THE DEPARTURE,The sullen waves came rolling toward the shore.
11764,THE DEPARTURE,
11765,THE DEPARTURE,"And still the more the stranger waited,"
11766,THE DEPARTURE,"The less his argosy was freighted,"
11767,THE DEPARTURE,"And still the more he stayed,"
11768,THE DEPARTURE,The less his debt was paid.
