54,SPRING,"To what purpose, April, do you return again?"
55,SPRING,Beauty is not enough.
56,SPRING,You can no longer quiet me with the redness
57,SPRING,Of little leaves opening stickily.
58,SPRING,I know what I know.
59,SPRING,The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
60,SPRING,The spikes of the crocus.
61,SPRING,The smell of the earth is good.
62,SPRING,It is apparent that there is no death.
63,SPRING,But what does that signify?
64,SPRING,Not only under ground are the brains of men
65,SPRING,"Eaten by maggots,"
66,SPRING,Life in itself
67,SPRING,"Is nothing,"
68,SPRING,"An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs."
69,SPRING,"It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,"
70,SPRING,April
71,SPRING,"Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers."

77,CITY TREES,
78,CITY TREES,"The trees along this city street,"
79,CITY TREES,"Save for the traffic and the trains,"
80,CITY TREES,Would make a sound as thin and sweet
81,CITY TREES,As trees in country lanes.
82,CITY TREES,
83,CITY TREES,And people standing in their shade
84,CITY TREES,"Out of a shower, undoubtedly"
85,CITY TREES,Would hear such music as is made
86,CITY TREES,Upon a country tree.
87,CITY TREES,
88,CITY TREES,"Oh, little leaves that are so dumb"
89,CITY TREES,"Against the shrieking city air,"
90,CITY TREES,"I watch you when the wind has come,--"

96,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG
97,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
98,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"God had called us, and we came;"
99,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Our loved Earth to ashes left;
100,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Heaven was a neighbor's house,"
101,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Open to us, bereft."
102,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
103,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Gay the lights of Heaven showed,"
104,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And 'twas God who walked ahead;
105,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Yet I wept along the road,"
106,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Wanting my own house instead.
107,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
108,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Wept unseen, unheeded cried,"
109,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""All you things my eyes have kissed,"
110,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Fare you well!  We meet no more,"
111,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Lovely, lovely tattered mist!"
112,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
113,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Weary wings that rise and fall
114,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"All day long above the fire!""--"
115,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Red with heat was every wall,"
116,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Rough with heat was every wire--
117,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
118,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Fare you well, you little winds"
119,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,That the flying embers chase!
120,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Fare you well, you shuddering day,"
121,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,With your hands before your face!
122,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
123,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And, ah, blackened by strange blight,"
124,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Or to a false sun unfurled,"
125,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Now forevermore goodbye,"
126,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,All the gardens in the world!
127,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
128,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"On the windless hills of Heaven,"
129,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That I have no wish to see,"
130,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"White, eternal lilies stand,"
131,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,By a lake of ebony.
132,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
133,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But the Earth forevermore
134,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Is a place where nothing grows,--"
135,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Dawn will come, and no bud break;"
136,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Evening, and no blossom close."
137,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
138,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Spring will come, and wander slow"
139,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Over an indifferent land,"
140,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Stand beside an empty creek,"
141,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Hold a dead seed in her hand."""
142,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
143,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"God had called us, and we came,"
144,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But the blessed road I trod
145,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Was a bitter road to me,"
146,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And at heart I questioned God.
147,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
148,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all"
149,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That the heart would most desire,"
150,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Held Earth naught save souls of sinners
151,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Worth the saving from a fire?
152,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
153,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Withered grass,--the wasted growing!"
154,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Aimless ache of laden boughs!"""
155,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Little things God had forgotten
156,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Called me, from my burning house."
157,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
158,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all"
159,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That the eye could ask to see,"
160,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,All the things I ever knew
161,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Are this blaze in back of me."""
162,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
163,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all"
164,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That the ear could think to lack,"
165,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,All the things I ever knew
166,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Are this roaring at my back."""
167,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
168,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"It was God who walked ahead,"
169,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Like a shepherd to the fold;
170,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"In his footsteps fared the weak,"
171,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And the weary and the old,"
172,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
173,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Glad enough of gladness over,"
174,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Ready for the peace to be,--"
175,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But a thing God had forgotten
176,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Was the growing bones of me.
177,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
178,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And I drew a bit apart,"
179,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And I lagged a bit behind,"
180,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And I thought on Peace Eternal,"
181,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Lest He look into my mind:
182,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
183,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And I gazed upon the sky,"
184,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And I thought of Heavenly Rest,--"
185,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And I slipped away like water
186,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Through the fingers of the blest!
187,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
188,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"All their eyes were fixed on Glory,"
189,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Not a glance brushed over me;
190,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Alleluia!  Alleluia!"""
191,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Up the road,--and I was free."
192,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
193,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And my heart rose like a freshet,"
194,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"And it swept me on before,"
195,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Giddy as a whirling stick,"
196,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Till I felt the earth once more.
197,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
198,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"All the earth was charred and black,"
199,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Fire had swept from pole to pole;
200,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And the bottom of the sea
201,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Was as brittle as a bowl;
202,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
203,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And the timbered mountain-top
204,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Was as naked as a skull,--"
205,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Nothing left, nothing left,"
206,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Of the Earth so beautiful!
207,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
208,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Earth,"" I said, ""how can I leave you?"""
209,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""You are all I have,"" I said;"
210,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""What is left to take my mind up,"
211,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Living always, and you dead?"""
212,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
213,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Speak!"" I said, ""Oh, tell me something!"
214,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Make a sign that I can see!
215,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,For a keepsake!  To keep always!
216,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Quick!--before God misses me!"""
217,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
218,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And I listened for a voice;--
219,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But my heart was all I heard;
220,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Not a screech-owl, not a loon,"
221,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Not a tree-toad said a word.
222,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
223,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And I waited for a sign;--
224,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Coals and cinders, nothing more;"
225,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And a little cloud of smoke
226,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Floating on a valley floor.
227,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
228,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And I peered into the smoke
229,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Till it rotted, like a fog:--"
230,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"There, encompassed round by fire,"
231,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Stood a blue-flag in a bog!
232,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
233,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Little flames came wading out,"
234,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Straining, straining towards its stem,"
235,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But it was so blue and tall
236,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,That it scorned to think of them!
237,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
238,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Red and thirsty were their tongues,"
239,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"As the tongues of wolves must be,"
240,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,But it was so blue and tall--
241,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!"
242,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
243,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"All my heart became a tear,"
244,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"All my soul became a tower,"
245,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Never loved I anything
246,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,As I loved that tall blue flower!
247,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
248,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,It was all the little boats
249,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That had ever sailed the sea,"
250,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,It was all the little books
251,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,That had gone to school with me;
252,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
253,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,On its roots like iron claws
254,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Rearing up so blue and tall,--"
255,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,It was all the gallant Earth
256,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,With its back against a wall!
257,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
258,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"In a breath, ere I had breathed,--"
259,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!--"
260,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"I was kneeling at its side,"
261,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And it leaned its head on me!
262,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
263,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Crumbling stones and sliding sand
264,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Is the road to Heaven now;
265,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Icy at my straining knees
266,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Drags the awful under-tow;
267,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
268,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Soon but stepping-stones of dust
269,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Will the road to Heaven be,--"
270,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Father, Son and Holy Ghost,"
271,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Reach a hand and rescue me!
272,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
273,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""There--there, my blue-flag flower;"
274,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Hush--hush--go to sleep;
275,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That is only God you hear,"
276,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Counting up His folded sheep!
277,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
278,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Lullabye--lullabye--
279,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"That is only God that calls,"
280,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Missing me, seeking me,"
281,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Ere the road to nothing falls!
282,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
283,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,He will set His mighty feet
284,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Firmly on the sliding sand;
285,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Like a little frightened bird
286,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,I will creep into His hand;
287,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
288,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"I will tell Him all my grief,"
289,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,I will tell Him all my sin;
290,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,He will give me half His robe
291,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,For a cloak to wrap you in.
292,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
293,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Lullabye--lullabye--"""
294,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Rocks the burnt-out planet free!--
295,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Father, Son and Holy Ghost,"
296,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Reach a hand and rescue me!
297,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
298,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Ah, the voice of love at last!"
299,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"Lo, at last the face of light!"
300,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And the whole of His white robe
301,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,For a cloak against the night!
302,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
303,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,And upon my heart asleep
304,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,All the things I ever knew!--
305,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"""Holds Heaven not some cranny, Lord,"
306,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,"For a flower so tall and blue?"""
307,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,
308,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,All's well and all's well!
309,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,Gay the lights of Heaven show!
310,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,In some moist and Heavenly place
311,THE BLUE-FLAG IN THE BOG,We will set it out to grow.

317,JOURNEY,
318,JOURNEY,"Ah, could I lay me down in this long grass"
319,JOURNEY,"And close my eyes, and let the quiet wind"
320,JOURNEY,"Blow over me--I am so tired, so tired"
321,JOURNEY,"Of passing pleasant places!  All my life,"
322,JOURNEY,"Following Care along the dusty road,"
323,JOURNEY,Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;
324,JOURNEY,Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand
325,JOURNEY,"Tugged ever, and I passed.  All my life long"
326,JOURNEY,Over my shoulder have I looked at peace;
327,JOURNEY,And now I fain would lie in this long grass
328,JOURNEY,And close my eyes.
329,JOURNEY,Yet onward!
330,JOURNEY,Cat birds call
331,JOURNEY,"Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk"
332,JOURNEY,"Are guttural.  Whip-poor-wills wake and cry,"
333,JOURNEY,Drawing the twilight close about their throats.
334,JOURNEY,Only my heart makes answer.  Eager vines
335,JOURNEY,Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees
336,JOURNEY,Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;
337,JOURNEY,"Dim, shady wood-roads, redolent of fern"
338,JOURNEY,"And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread"
339,JOURNEY,"Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant,"
340,JOURNEY,Look back and beckon ere they disappear.
341,JOURNEY,"Only my heart, only my heart responds."
342,JOURNEY,"Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side"
343,JOURNEY,"All through the dragging day,--sharp underfoot"
344,JOURNEY,"And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs--"
345,JOURNEY,"But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach,"
346,JOURNEY,"And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling,"
347,JOURNEY,"The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake,"
348,JOURNEY,"Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road"
349,JOURNEY,"A gateless garden, and an open path:"
350,JOURNEY,"My feet to follow, and my heart to hold."

358,EEL-GRASS,All that I really love
359,EEL-GRASS,"Is the rain that flattens on the bay,"
360,EEL-GRASS,And the eel-grass in the cove;
361,EEL-GRASS,The jingle-shells that lie and bleach
362,EEL-GRASS,"At the tide-line, and the trace"
363,EEL-GRASS,Of higher tides along the beach:
364,EEL-GRASS,Nothing in this place.

370,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,
371,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,There will be rose and rhododendron
372,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,When you are dead and under ground;
373,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Still will be heard from white syringas
374,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;"
375,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,
376,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Still will the tamaracks be raining
377,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"After the rain has ceased, and still"
378,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Will there be robins in the stubble,"
379,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
380,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,
381,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
382,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Nothing will know that you are gone,"
383,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Saving alone some sullen plough-land
384,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,None but yourself sets foot upon;
385,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,
386,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
387,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Nothing will know that you are dead,--"
388,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"These, and perhaps a useless wagon"
389,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Standing beside some tumbled shed.
390,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,
391,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Oh, there will pass with your great passing"
392,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Little of beauty not your own,--"
393,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,"Only the light from common water,"
394,ELEGY BEFORE DEATH,Only the grace from simple stone!

430,THE BEAN-STALK,
431,THE BEAN-STALK,"Cracking past my icy ears,"

438,THE BEAN-STALK,"Dry and grinning,"
439,THE BEAN-STALK,"And I felt my foot slip,"
440,THE BEAN-STALK,"And I scratched the wind and whined,"
441,THE BEAN-STALK,"And I clutched the stalk and jabbered,"
442,THE BEAN-STALK,"With my eyes shut blind,--"
443,THE BEAN-STALK,What a wind!  What a wind!
444,THE BEAN-STALK,
445,THE BEAN-STALK,"Your broad sky, Giant,"

868,TO A POET THAT DIED YOUNG,"That a man you never knew,"
869,TO A POET THAT DIED YOUNG,"When your grave was far and green,"

1267,ODE TO SILENCE,"Thrown to the earth and fallen forward on their jointless knees,"
1268,ODE TO SILENCE,And urns funereal altered into dust

1277,ODE TO SILENCE,There dumbly like a worm all day the still white orchid feeds;
1278,ODE TO SILENCE,But never an echo of your daughters' laughter
