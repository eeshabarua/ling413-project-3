227,I,
228,I,
229,I,How many million Aprils came
230,I,Before I ever knew
231,I,"How white a cherry bough could be,"
232,I,"A bed of squills, how blue!"
233,I,
234,I,And many a dancing April
235,I,"When life is done with me,"
236,I,Will lift the blue flame of the flower
237,I,And the white flame of the tree.
238,I,
239,I,"Oh burn me with your beauty, then,"
240,I,"Oh hurt me, tree and flower,"
241,I,Lest in the end death try to take
242,I,Even this glistening hour.
243,I,
244,I,"O shaken flowers, O shimmering trees,"
245,I,"O sunlit white and blue,"
246,I,"Wound me, that I, through endless sleep,"
247,I,May bear the scar of you.

253,I,
254,I,
255,I,
256,I,Alone in the night
257,I,On a dark hill
258,I,With pines around me
259,I,"Spicy and still,"
260,I,
261,I,And a heaven full of stars
262,I,"Over my head,"
263,I,White and topaz
264,I,And misty red;
265,I,
266,I,Myriads with beating
267,I,Hearts of fire
268,I,That aeons
269,I,Cannot vex or tire;
270,I,
271,I,Up the dome of heaven
272,I,"Like a great hill,"
273,I,I watch them marching
274,I,"Stately and still,"
275,I,
276,I,And I know that I
277,I,Am honored to be
278,I,Witness
279,I,Of so much majesty.

284,I,"""What Do I Care?"""
285,I,
286,I,
287,I,
288,I,"What do I care, in the dreams and the languor of spring,"
289,I,That my songs do not show me at all?
290,I,"For they are a fragrance, and I am a flint and a fire,"
291,I,"I am an answer, they are only a call."
292,I,
293,I,"But what do I care, for love will be over so soon,"
294,I,"Let my heart have its say and my mind stand idly by,"
295,I,"For my mind is proud and strong enough to be silent,"
296,I,"It is my heart that makes my songs, not I."
297,I,
298,I,
299,I,
300,I,
301,I,Meadowlarks
302,I,
303,I,
304,I,
305,I,"In the silver light after a storm,"
306,I,"Under dripping boughs of bright new green,"
307,I,I take the low path to hear the meadowlarks
308,I,Alone and high-hearted as if I were a queen.
309,I,
310,I,What have I to fear in life or death
311,I,"Who have known three things:  the kiss in the night,"
312,I,"The white flying joy when a song is born,"
313,I,And meadowlarks whistling in silver light.
314,I,
315,I,
316,I,
317,I,
318,I,Driftwood
319,I,
320,I,
321,I,
322,I,My forefathers gave me
323,I,"My spirit's shaken flame,"
324,I,"The shape of hands, the beat of heart,"
325,I,The letters of my name.
326,I,
327,I,"But it was my lovers,"
328,I,"And not my sleeping sires,"
329,I,Who gave the flame its changeful
330,I,And iridescent fires;
331,I,
332,I,As the driftwood burning
333,I,Learned its jewelled blaze
334,I,From the sea's blue splendor
335,I,Of colored nights and days.
336,I,

340,I,"""I Have Loved Hours at Sea"""
341,I,
342,I,
343,I,
344,I,"I have loved hours at sea, gray cities,"
345,I,"The fragile secret of a flower,"
346,I,"Music, the making of a poem"
347,I,That gave me heaven for an hour;
348,I,
349,I,"First stars above a snowy hill,"
350,I,"Voices of people kindly and wise,"
351,I,"And the great look of love, long hidden,"
352,I,Found at last in meeting eyes.
353,I,
354,I,I have loved much and been loved deeply--
355,I,"Oh when my spirit's fire burns low,"
356,I,"Leave me the darkness and the stillness,"
357,I,I shall be tired and glad to go.
358,I,
359,I,
360,I,
361,I,
362,I,August Moonrise
363,I,
364,I,
365,I,
366,I,"The sun was gone, and the moon was coming"
367,I,Over the blue Connecticut hills;
368,I,"The west was rosy, the east was flushed,"
369,I,And over my head the swallows rushed
370,I,"This way and that, with changeful wills."
371,I,I heard them twitter and watched them dart
372,I,Now together and now apart
373,I,Like dark petals blown from a tree;
374,I,The maples stamped against the west
375,I,"Were black and stately and full of rest,"
376,I,And the hazy orange moon grew up
377,I,And slowly changed to yellow gold
378,I,"While the hills were darkened, fold on fold"
379,I,To a deeper blue than a flower could hold.
380,I,"Down the hill I went, and then"
381,I,"I forgot the ways of men,"
382,I,"For night-scents, heady, and damp and cool"
383,I,Wakened ecstasy in me
384,I,On the brink of a shining pool.
385,I,
386,I,"O Beauty, out of many a cup"
387,I,You have made me drunk and wild
388,I,"Ever since I was a child,"
389,I,But when have I been sure as now
390,I,That no bitterness can bend
391,I,And no sorrow wholly bow
392,I,One who loves you to the end?
393,I,And though I must give my breath
394,I,"And my laughter all to death,"
395,I,"And my eyes through which joy came,"
396,I,"And my heart, a wavering flame;"
397,I,If all must leave me and go back
398,I,Along a blind and fearful track
399,I,"So that you can make anew,"
400,I,"Fusing with intenser fire,"
401,I,Something nearer your desire;
402,I,If my soul must go alone
403,I,"Through a cold infinity,"
404,I,"Or even if it vanish, too,"
405,I,"Beauty, I have worshipped you."
406,I,
407,I,Let this single hour atone
408,I,For the theft of all of me.

423,II,Places
424,II,
425,II,
426,II,
427,II,"Places I love come back to me like music,"
428,II,Hush me and heal me when I am very tired;
429,II,I see the oak woods at Saxton's flaming
430,II,In a flare of crimson by the frost newly fired;
431,II,And I am thirsty for the spring in the valley
432,II,As for a kiss ungiven and long desired.
433,II,
434,II,"I know a bright world of snowy hills at Boonton,"
435,II,"A blue and white dazzling light on everything one sees,"
436,II,The ice-covered branches of the hemlocks sparkle
437,II,"Bending low and tinkling in the sharp thin breeze,"
438,II,And iridescent crystals fall and crackle on the snow-crust
439,II,With the winter sun drawing cold blue shadows from the trees.
440,II,
441,II,"Violet now, in veil on veil of evening"
442,II,The hills across from Cromwell grow dreamy and far;
443,II,A wood-thrush is singing soft as a viol
444,II,In the heart of the hollow where the dark pools are;
445,II,The primrose has opened her pale yellow flowers
446,II,And heaven is lighting star after star.
447,II,
448,II,Places I love come back to me like music--
449,II,"Mid-ocean, midnight, the waves buzz drowsily;"
450,II,In the ship's deep churning the eerie phosphorescence
451,II,"Is like the souls of people who were drowned at sea,"
452,II,"And I can hear a man's voice, speaking, hushed, insistent,"
453,II,"At midnight, in mid-ocean, hour on hour to me."
454,II,
455,II,
456,II,
457,II,
458,II,Old Tunes
459,II,
460,II,
461,II,
462,II,"As the waves of perfume, heliotrope, rose,"
463,II,"Float in the garden when no wind blows,"
464,II,"Come to us, go from us, whence no one knows;"
465,II,
466,II,"So the old tunes float in my mind,"
467,II,"And go from me leaving no trace behind,"
468,II,Like fragrance borne on the hush of the wind.
469,II,
470,II,But in the instant the airs remain
471,II,I know the laughter and the pain
472,II,Of times that will not come again.
473,II,
474,II,I try to catch at many a tune
475,II,"Like petals of light fallen from the moon,"
476,II,"Broken and bright on a dark lagoon,"
477,II,
478,II,But they float away--for who can hold
479,II,"Youth, or perfume or the moon's gold?"
480,II,
481,II,
482,II,
483,II,
484,II,"""Only in Sleep"""
485,II,
486,II,
487,II,
488,II,"Only in sleep I see their faces,"
489,II,"Children I played with when I was a child,"
490,II,"Louise comes back with her brown hair braided,"
491,II,Annie with ringlets warm and wild.
492,II,
493,II,Only in sleep Time is forgotten--
494,II,"What may have come to them, who can know?"
495,II,"Yet we played last night as long ago,"
496,II,And the doll-house stood at the turn of the stair.
497,II,
498,II,"The years had not sharpened their smooth round faces,"
499,II,I met their eyes and found them mild--
500,II,"Do they, too, dream of me, I wonder,"
501,II,And for them am I too a child?
502,II,
503,II,
504,II,
505,II,
506,II,Redbirds
507,II,
508,II,
509,II,
510,II,"Redbirds, redbirds,"
511,II,"Long and long ago,"
512,II,What a honey-call you had
513,II,In hills I used to know;
514,II,
515,II,"Redbud, buckberry,"
516,II,Wild plum-tree
517,II,And proud river sweeping
518,II,"Southward to the sea,"
519,II,
520,II,Brown and gold in the sun
521,II,"Sparkling far below,"
522,II,Trailing stately round her bluffs
523,II,Where the poplars grow--
524,II,
525,II,"Redbirds, redbirds,"
526,II,Are you singing still
527,II,As you sang one May day
528,II,On Saxton's Hill?
529,II,
530,II,
531,II,
532,II,
533,II,Sunset:  St. Louis
534,II,
535,II,
536,II,
537,II,"Hushed in the smoky haze of summer sunset,"
538,II,"When I came home again from far-off places,"
539,II,How many times I saw my western city
540,II,Dream by her river.
541,II,
542,II,Then for an hour the water wore a mantle
543,II,Of tawny gold and mauve and misted turquoise
544,II,Under the tall and darkened arches bearing
545,II,"Gray, high-flung bridges."
546,II,
547,II,"Against the sunset, water-towers and steeples"
548,II,"Flickered with fire up the slope to westward,"
549,II,And old warehouses poured their purple shadows
550,II,Across the levee.
551,II,
552,II,"High over them the black train swept with thunder,"
553,II,"Cleaving the city, leaving far beneath it"
554,II,Wharf-boats moored beside the old side-wheelers
555,II,Resting in twilight.
556,II,
557,II,
558,II,
559,II,
560,II,The Coin
561,II,
562,II,
563,II,
564,II,Into my heart's treasury
565,II,I slipped a coin
566,II,That time cannot take
567,II,"Nor a thief purloin,--"
568,II,Oh better than the minting
569,II,Of a gold-crowned king
570,II,Is the safe-kept memory
571,II,Of a lovely thing.

576,II,The Voice
577,II,
578,II,
579,II,
580,II,"Atoms as old as stars,"
581,II,"Mutation on mutation,"
582,II,Millions and millions of cells
583,II,"Dividing yet still the same,"
584,II,"From air and changing earth,"
585,II,"From ancient Eastern rivers,"
586,II,"From turquoise tropic seas,"
587,II,Unto myself I came.
588,II,
589,II,My spirit like my flesh
590,II,"Sprang from a thousand sources,"
591,II,"From cave-man, hunter and shepherd,"
592,II,"From Karnak, Cyprus, Rome;"
593,II,The living thoughts in me
594,II,"Spring from dead men and women,"
595,II,Forgotten time out of mind
596,II,And many as bubbles of foam.
597,II,
598,II,Here for a moment's space
599,II,"Into the light out of darkness,"
600,II,I come and they come with me
601,II,Finding words with my breath;
602,II,From the wisdom of many life-times
603,II,"I hear them cry:  ""Forever"
604,II,"Seek for Beauty, she only"
605,II,"Fights with man against Death!"""

623,III,In Warsaw in Poland
624,III,"Half the world away,"
625,III,The one I love best of all
626,III,Thought of me to-day;
627,III,
628,III,"I know, for I went"
629,III,"Winged as a bird,"
630,III,In the wide flowing wind
631,III,His own voice I heard;
632,III,
633,III,His arms were round me
634,III,"In a ferny place,"
635,III,I looked in the pool
636,III,And there was his face--
637,III,
638,III,But now it is night
639,III,And the cold stars say:
640,III,"""Warsaw in Poland"

651,III,"And hours that go on broken wings,"
652,III,"A thirsty body, a tired heart"
653,III,"And the unchanging ache of things,"
654,III,If I could make a single song
655,III,"As lovely and as full of light,"
656,III,As hushed and brief as a falling star
657,III,On a winter night.

663,III,
664,III,
665,III,
666,III,"There never was a mood of mine,"
667,III,"Gay or heart-broken, luminous or dull,"
668,III,But you could ease me of its fever
669,III,And give it back to me more beautiful.
670,III,
671,III,"In many another soul I broke the bread,"
672,III,"And drank the wine and played the happy guest,"
673,III,"But I was lonely, I remembered you;"

682,III,
683,III,"Oh you are coming, coming, coming,"
684,III,How will hungry Time put by the hours till then?--
685,III,But why does it anger my heart to long so
686,III,For one man out of the world of men?
687,III,
688,III,Oh I would live in myself only
689,III,And build my life lightly and still as a dream--
690,III,Are not my thoughts clearer than your thoughts
691,III,And colored like stones in a running stream?
692,III,
693,III,"Now the slow moon brightens in heaven,"
694,III,"The stars are ready, the night is here--"

710,III,"On gold-slippered feet,"

725,III,It was April when you came
726,III,"The first time to me,"
727,III,And my first look in your eyes
728,III,Was like my first look at the sea.
729,III,
730,III,We have been together
731,III,Four Aprils now
732,III,Watching for the green
733,III,On the swaying willow bough;
734,III,
735,III,Yet whenever I turn
736,III,"To your gray eyes over me,"
737,III,It is as though I looked
738,III,For the first time at the sea.

749,III,It was as though a net of words
750,III,Were flung to catch a star;
751,III,
752,III,It was as though I curved my hand
753,III,"And dipped sea-water eagerly,"
754,III,Only to find it lost the blue
755,III,Dark splendor of the sea.

765,III,"Love makes them shine,"
766,III,Your eyes that lean
767,III,So close to mine.
768,III,
769,III,"We have long been lovers,"
770,III,We know the range
771,III,Of each other's moods
772,III,And how they change;
773,III,
774,III,But when we look
775,III,At each other so
776,III,Then we feel
777,III,How little we know;
778,III,
779,III,"The spirit eludes us,"
780,III,Timid and free--
781,III,Can I ever know you
782,III,Or you know me?

805,IV,
806,IV,"I am alone with Weakness and Pain,"
807,IV,"Sick abed and June is going,"
808,IV,"I cannot keep her, she hurries by"
809,IV,With the silver-green of her garments blowing.
810,IV,
811,IV,Men and women pass in the street
812,IV,"Glad of the shining sapphire weather,"

815,IV,
816,IV,"They are the runners in the sun,"

830,IV,"Beaten my body, bruised my soul,"
831,IV,Left me nothing lovely or whole--
832,IV,"Yet I have wrested a gift from you,"
833,IV,Day that dies in dusky blue:
834,IV,
835,IV,For suddenly over the factories
836,IV,I saw a moon in the cloudy seas--
837,IV,A wisp of beauty all alone
838,IV,In a world as hard and gray as stone--

853,IV,

871,IV,"And I could let the cities go,"

886,IV,Have I a mother like Pain?

904,IV,
905,IV,Where grass and bending flowers
906,IV,"Were growing,"
907,IV,The field lies broken now
908,IV,For another sowing.

926,IV,
927,IV,He paused at every door
928,IV,And listened to the breath
929,IV,Of those who did not know
930,IV,How near they were to Death.
931,IV,

947,IV,That I loved all lovely things
948,IV,And I tried to take their stings
949,IV,With gay unembittered lips;
950,IV,"That I loved with all my strength,"
951,IV,"To my soul's full depth and length,"
952,IV,"Careless if my heart must break,"

1442,VII,"Many a thing you did to save me,"
1443,VII,"Many a holy gift you gave me,"

1887,X,
1888,X,"Year in, year out, by day and night"

1892,X,
1893,X,"In winter fog, in gathering mist"

1966,X,
1967,X,It was nearly level along the beaten track

2343,XII,"Teasdale was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where she attended a school"
2344,XII,that was founded by the grandfather of another great poet from St. Louis--
2345,XII,T. S. Eliot.  She later associated herself more with New York City.
2346,XII,"Her first book of poems was ""Sonnets to Duse"" (1907),"
2347,XII,"but ""Helen of Troy"" (1911) was the true launch of her career,"
2348,XII,"followed by ""Rivers to the Sea"" (1915), ""Love Songs"" (1917),"
2349,XII,"""Flame and Shadow"" (1920) and more.  Her final volume, ""Strange Victory"","
2350,XII,is considered by many to be predictive of her suicide in 1933.
