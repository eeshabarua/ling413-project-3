345,,Because I believe that Sidney Lanier was much more than a clever artisan
346,,"in rhyme and metre; because he will, I think, take his final rank"
347,,"with the first princes of American song, I am glad to provide"
348,,this slight memorial.  There is sufficient material in his letters
349,,"for an extremely interesting biography, which could be properly prepared"
350,,only by his wife.  These pages can give but a sketch of his life and work.
351,,
352,,"Sidney Lanier was born at Macon, Ga., on the third of February, 1842."
353,,"His earliest known ancestor of the name was Jerome Lanier,"
354,,"a Huguenot refugee, who was attached to the court of Queen Elizabeth,"
355,,"very likely as a musical composer; and whose son, Nicholas,"
356,,"was in high favor with James I. and Charles I., as director of music,"
357,,"painter, and political envoy; and whose grandson, Nicholas,"
358,,held a similar position in the court of Charles II.  A portrait
359,,"of the elder Nicholas Lanier, by his friend Van Dyck, was sold,"
360,,"with other pictures belonging to Charles I., after his execution."
361,,"The younger Nicholas was the first Marshal, or presiding officer,"
362,,"of the Society of Musicians, incorporated at the Restoration,"
363,,"""for the improvement of the science and the interest of its professors;"""
364,,and it is remarkable that four others of the name of Lanier
365,,"were among the few incorporators, one of them, John Lanier,"
366,,very likely father of the Sir John Lanier who fought as Major-General
367,,"at the Battle of the Boyne, and fell gloriously at Steinkirk"
368,,along with the brave Douglas.
369,,
370,,The American branch of the family originated as early as 1716
371,,"with the immigration of Thomas Lanier, who settled with other colonists"
372,,"on a grant of land ten miles square, which includes the present city"
373,,"of Richmond, Va.  One of the family, a Thomas Lanier, married an aunt"
374,,"of George Washington.  The family is somewhat widely scattered,"
375,,chiefly in the Southern States.
376,,
377,,"The father of our poet was Robert S. Lanier, a lawyer still living"
378,,"in Macon, Ga.  His mother was Mary Anderson, a Virginian of Scotch descent,"
379,,from a family that supplied members of the House of Burgesses of Virginia
380,,"for many years and in more than one generation, and was gifted in poetry,"
381,,"music, and oratory."
382,,
383,,"His earliest passion was for music.  As a child he learned to play,"
384,,"almost without instruction, on every kind of instrument he could find;"
385,,"and while yet a boy he played the flute, organ, piano, violin, guitar,"
386,,"and banjo, especially devoting himself to the flute in deference to"
387,,"his father, who feared for him the powerful fascination of the violin."
388,,"For it was the violin-voice that, above all others, commanded his soul."
389,,He has related that during his college days it would sometimes so exalt him
390,,"in rapture, that presently he would sink from his solitary music-worship"
391,,"into a deep trance, thence to awake, alone, on the floor of his room,"
392,,sorely shaken in nerve.
393,,
394,,In after years more than one listener remarked the strange violin effects
395,,which he conquered from the flute.  His devotion to music
396,,"rather alarmed than pleased his friends, and while it was here"
397,,"that he first discovered that he possessed decided genius,"
398,,"he for some time shared the early notion of his parents,"
399,,"that it was an unworthy pursuit, and he rather repressed his taste."
400,,"He did not then know by what inheritance it had come to him,"
401,,nor how worthy is the art.
402,,
403,,"At the age of fourteen he entered the sophomore class of Oglethorpe College,"
404,,"an institution under Presbyterian control near Midway, Ga.,"
405,,"which had not vitality enough to survive the war.  He graduated in 1860,"
406,,"at the age of eighteen, with the first honors of his class,"
407,,having lost a year during which he took a clerkship in the Macon post-office.
408,,"At least one genuine impulse was received in this college life,"
409,,"and that proceeded from Professor James Woodrow, who was then"
410,,"one of Sidney's teachers, and who has since been connected with"
411,,"the University and Theological Seminary in Columbia, S. C."
412,,During the last weeks of his life Mr. Lanier stated
413,,that he owed to Professor Woodrow the strongest and most valuable stimulus
414,,of his youth.  Immediately on his graduation he was called to a tutorship
415,,"in the college, which position he held until the outbreak of the war."
416,,
417,,"And here, with some hesitation, I record, as a true biography requires,"
418,,the development of his consciousness of possessing real genius.
419,,"One with this gift has a right to know it, just as others know if they possess"
420,,talent or shiftiness of resource.  While we do not talk so much of genius now
421,,"as we did a generation ago, we can yet recognize the difference between"
422,,the fervor of that divine birth and the cantering of the livery Pegasus
423,,"forth and back, along the vulgar boulevards over which facile talent"
424,,"rides his daily hack.  Only once or twice, in his own private note-book,"
425,,"or in a letter to his wife when it was needful, in sickness and loneliness,"
426,,to strengthen her will and his by testifying his own deepest consciousness
427,,"of power, did he whisper the assurance of his strength."
428,,"But he knew it, and she knew it, and it gave his will a peace in toil,"
429,,"a sun-lit peace, notwithstanding sickness, or want, or misapprehension,"
430,,calm above the zone of clouds.
431,,
432,,"As I have said, his genius he first fully discovered in music."
433,,I copy from his pencilled college note-book what cannot have been written
434,,after he was eighteen years old.  The boy had been discussing
435,,the question with himself how far his inclinations were to be regarded
436,,as indicating his best capacities and his duties.  He says:
437,,
438,,==
439,,"""The point which I wish to settle is merely, by what method shall I ascertain"
440,,"what I am fit for, as preliminary to ascertaining God's will"
441,,"with reference to me; or what my inclinations are, as preliminary"
442,,"to ascertaining what my capacities are, that is, what I am fit for."
443,,"I am more than all perplexed by this fact, that the prime inclination,"
444,,"that is, natural bent (which I have checked, though) of my nature is to music;"
445,,"and for that I have the greatest talent; indeed, not boasting,"
446,,"for God gave it me, I have an extraordinary musical talent,"
447,,and feel it within me plainly that I could rise as high as any composer.
448,,"But I cannot bring myself to believe that I was intended for a musician,"
449,,"because it seems so small a business in comparison with other things which,"
450,,"it seems to me, I might do.  Question here, What is the province of music"
451,,"in the economy of the world?"""
452,,==
453,,
454,,"Similar aspirations he felt at this early age, probably eighteen,"
455,,"for grand literary labor, as the same note-book would bear witness."
456,,"We see here the boy talking to himself, a boy who had found in himself"
457,,a standard above anything in his fellows.
458,,
459,,The breaking out of the war summoned Sidney Lanier from books to arms.
460,,"In April, 1861, he enlisted in the Confederate Army,"
461,,"with the Macon Volunteers of the Second Georgia Battalion,"
462,,the first military organization which left Georgia for Virginia.
463,,From his childhood he had had a military taste.  Even as a small boy
464,,"he had raised a company of boys armed with bows and arrows,"
465,,and so well did he drill them that an honored place was granted them
466,,in the military parades of their elders.  Having volunteered as a private
467,,"at the age of nineteen, he remained a private till the last year of the war."
468,,Three times he was offered promotion and refused it because
469,,"it would separate him from his younger brother, who was his companion in arms,"
470,,as their singularly tender devotion would not allow them to be parted.
471,,"The first year of service in Virginia was easy and pleasant,"
472,,"and he spent his abundant leisure in music and the study of German,"
473,,"French, and Spanish.  He was in the battles of Seven Pines,"
474,,"Drewry's Bluffs, and the seven days' fighting about Richmond,"
475,,culminating in the terrible struggle of Malvern Hill.  After this campaign
476,,"he was transferred, with his brother, to the signal service,"
477,,the joke among his less fortunate companions being that he was selected
478,,because he could play the flute.  His headquarters were now
479,,"for a short period at Petersburg, where he had the advantage"
480,,"of a small local library, but where he began to feel the premonitions"
481,,"of that fatal disease, consumption, against which he battled"
482,,for fifteen years.  The regular full inspirations required by the flute
483,,probably prolonged his life.  In 1863 his detachment was mounted
484,,and did service in Virginia and North Carolina.  At last the two brothers
485,,"were separated, it coming in the duty of each to take charge of a vessel"
486,,"which was to run the blockade.  Sidney's vessel was captured,"
487,,"and he was for five months in Point Lookout prison, until he was exchanged"
488,,"(with his flute, for he never lost it), near the close of the war."
489,,"Those were very hard days for him, and a picture of them is given"
490,,"in his ""Tiger Lilies"", the novel which he wrote two years afterward."
491,,"It is a luxuriant, unpruned work, written in haste for the press"
492,,"within the space of three weeks, but one which gave rich promise of the poet."
493,,"A chapter in the middle of the book, introducing the scenes"
494,,"of those four years of struggle, is wholly devoted to a remarkable metaphor,"
495,,"which becomes an allegory and a sermon, in which war is pictured"
496,,"as ""a strange, enormous, terrible flower,"" which ""the early spring of 1861"
497,,"brought to bloom besides innumerable violets and jessamines."""
498,,He tells how the plant is grown; what arguments the horticulturists give
499,,"for cultivating it; how Christ inveighed against it,"
500,,and how its shades are damp and its odors unhealthy;
501,,and what a fine specimen was grown the other day in North America
502,,"by ""two wealthy landed proprietors, who combined all their resources"
503,,"of money, of blood, of bones, of tears, of sulphur, and what not,"
504,,"to make this the grandest specimen of modern horticulture."""
505,,"""It is supposed by some,"" says he, ""that seed of this American specimen"
506,,(now dead) yet remains in the land; but as for this author
507,,"(who, with many friends, suffered from the unhealthy odors of the plant),"
508,,"he could find it in his heart to wish fervently that this seed,"
509,,"if there be verily any, might perish in the germ, utterly out of sight"
510,,"and life and memory, and out of the remote hope of resurrection,"
511,,"forever and ever, no matter in whose granary they are cherished!"""
512,,"Through those four years, though earnestly devoted to the cause,"
513,,"and fulfilling his duties with zeal, his horror of war grew to the end."
514,,"He had entered it in a ""crack"" regiment, with a dandy uniform,"
515,,"and was first encamped near Norfolk, where the gardens,"
516,,"with the Northern market hopelessly cut off, were given freely"
517,,"to the soldiers, who lived in every luxury; and every man had his sweetheart"
518,,"in Norfolk.  But the tyranny and Christlessness of war oppressed him,"
519,,though he loved the free life in the saddle and under the stars.
520,,
521,,"In February, 1865, he was released from Point Lookout"
522,,"and undertook the weary return on foot to his home in Georgia,"
523,,"with the twenty-dollar gold piece which he had in his pocket when captured,"
524,,"and which was returned to him, with his other little effects, when he"
525,,"was released.  Of course he had the flute, which he had hidden in his sleeve"
526,,"when he entered the prison, and which had earned him some comforts."
527,,"He reached home March 15th, with his strength utterly exhausted."
528,,"There followed six weeks of desperate illness, and just as he began"
529,,to recover from it his beloved mother died of consumption.
530,,"He himself arose from his sick-bed with pronounced congestion of one lung,"
531,,but found relief in two months of out-of-door life with an uncle
532,,"at Point Clear, Mobile Bay.  From December, 1865, to April, 1867,"
533,,"he filled a clerkship in Montgomery, Ala., and in the next month"
534,,made his first visit to New York on the business of publishing
535,,"his ""Tiger Lilies"", written in April.  In September, 1867, he took charge"
536,,"of a country academy of nearly a hundred pupils in Prattville, Ala.,"
537,,"and was married in December of the same year to Miss Mary Day,"
538,,"daughter of Charles Day, of Macon."
539,,
540,,To the years before Mr. Lanier's marriage belong a dozen poems
541,,included in this volume.  Two of them are translations from the German
542,,"made during the war; the others are songs and miscellaneous poems,"
543,,"full of flush and force, but not yet moulded by those laws of art"
544,,of whose authority he had hardly become conscious.  His access to books
545,,"was limited, and he expressed himself more with music than with literature,"

547,,or those of Tennyson.
548,,
549,,"In January, 1868, the next month after his marriage,"
550,,"he suffered his first hemorrhage from the lungs, and returned in May to Macon,"
551,,"in very low health.  Here he remained, studying and afterward practising law"
552,,"with his father, until December, 1872.  During this period there came,"
553,,"in the spring and summer of 1870, a more alarming decline with settled cough."
554,,"He went for treatment to New York, where he remained two months,"
555,,returning in October greatly improved and strong in hope;
556,,but again at home he lost ground steadily.  He was now fairly engaged
557,,"in the brave struggle against consumption, which could have but one end."
558,,So precarious already was his health that a change of residence
559,,"was determined on, and in December, 1872, he went to San Antonio, Texas,"
560,,"in search of a permanent home there, leaving his wife and children meanwhile"
561,,at Macon.  But the climate did not prove favorable and he returned
562,,"in April, 1873."
563,,
564,,"During these five years a sense of holy obligation, based on the conviction"
565,,"that special talents had been given him, and that the time might be short,"
566,,"rested upon Lanier, until it was impossible to resist it longer."
567,,He felt himself called to something other than a country attorney's practice.
568,,"It was the compulsion of waiting utterance, not yet enfranchised."
569,,From Texas he wrote to his wife:
570,,
571,,==
572,,"""Were it not for some circumstances which make such a proposition"
573,,"seem absurd in the highest degree, I would think that I am shortly to die,"
574,,and that my spirit hath been singing its swan-song before dissolution.
575,,"All day my soul hath been cutting swiftly into the great space of the subtle,"
576,,"unspeakable deep, driven by wind after wind of heavenly melody."
577,,"The very inner spirit and essence of all wind-songs, bird-songs,"
578,,"passion-songs, folk-songs, country-songs, sex-songs, soul-songs and body-songs"
579,,"hath blown upon me in quick gusts like the breath of passion,"
580,,"and sailed me into a sea of vast dreams, whereof each wave is at once"
581,,"a vision and a melody."""
582,,==
583,,
584,,Now fully determined to give himself to music and literature so long
585,,"as he could keep death at bay, he sought a land of books.  Taking his flute"
586,,"and his pen for sword and staff, he turned his face northward."
587,,"After visiting New York he made his home in Baltimore, December, 1873,"
588,,under engagement as first flute for the Peabody Symphony Concerts.
589,,
590,,With his settlement in Baltimore begins a story of as brave and sad a struggle
591,,as the history of genius records.  On the one hand was the opportunity
592,,"for study, and the full consciousness of power, and a will never subdued;"
593,,"and on the other a body wasting with consumption, that must be forced"
594,,to task beyond its strength not merely to express the thoughts of beauty
595,,"which strove for utterance, but from the necessity of providing bread"
596,,"for his babes.  His father would have had him return to Macon,"
597,,"and settle down with him in business and share his income,"
598,,but that would have been the suicide of every duty and ambition.
599,,"So he wrote from Baltimore to his father, November 29, 1873:"
600,,
601,,==
602,,"""I have given your last letter the fullest and most careful consideration."
603,,After doing so I feel sure that Macon is not the place for me.
604,,"If you could taste the delicious crystalline air, and the champagne breeze"
605,,"that I've just been rushing about in, I am equally sure"
606,,that in point of climate you would agree with me that my chance for life
607,,"is ten times as great here as in Macon.  Then, as to business, why should I,"
608,,"nay, how CAN I, settle myself down to be a third-rate struggling lawyer"
609,,"for the balance of my little life, as long as there is a certainty"
610,,almost absolute that I can do some other thing so much better?
611,,"Several persons, from whose judgment in such matters there can be no appeal,"
612,,"have told me, for instance, that I am the greatest flute-player in the world;"
613,,"and several others, of equally authoritative judgment,"
614,,have given me an almost equal encouragement to work with my pen.
615,,(Of course I protest against the necessity which makes me write
616,,such things about myself.  I only do so because I so appreciate
617,,the love and tenderness which prompt you to desire me with you
618,,"that I will make the fullest explanation possible of my course,"
619,,out of reciprocal honor and respect for the motives which lead you
620,,"to think differently from me.)  My dear father, think how, for twenty years,"
621,,"through poverty, through pain, through weariness, through sickness,"
622,,through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college and of a bare army
623,,"and then of an exacting business life, through all the discouragement"
624,,of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways --
625,,"I say, think how, in spite of all these depressing circumstances,"
626,,"and of a thousand more which I could enumerate, these two figures"
627,,of music and of poetry have steadily kept in my heart
628,,"so that I could not banish them.  Does it not seem to you as to me,"
629,,that I begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees
630,,"of these two sublime arts, after having followed them so long and so humbly,"
631,,"and through so much bitterness?"""
632,,==
633,,
634,,What could his father do but yield?  And what could he do
635,,during the following years of his son's fight for standing-room on the planet
636,,"but help?  But for that help, generously given by his father and brother,"
637,,"as their ability allowed, at the critical times of utter prostration,"
638,,the end would not have been long delayed.  For the little
639,,that was necessary to give his household a humble support
640,,it was not easy for the most strenuous young author to win by his pen
641,,"in the intervals between his hemorrhages.  He asked for very little,"
642,,"only the supply of absolute necessities, what it would be easy"
643,,"for a well man to earn, but what it was very hard for a man to earn"
644,,"scarce able to leave his bed, dependent on the chance income had"
645,,"from poems and articles in magazines that would take them, or from courses"
646,,of lectures in schools.  Often for months together he could do no work.
647,,"He was driven to Texas, to Florida, to Pennsylvania, to North Carolina,"
648,,to try to recover health from pine breaths and clover blossoms.
649,,"Supported by the implicit faith of one heart, which fully believed"
650,,"in his genius, and was willing to wait if he could only find his opportunity,"
651,,his courage never failed.  He still kept before himself first his ideal
652,,"and his mission, and he longed to live that he might accomplish them."
653,,"It must have been in such a mood that, soon after coming to Baltimore,"
654,,"he wrote to his wife, who was detained in the South:"
655,,
656,,==
657,,"""So many great ideas for Art are born to me each day, I am swept away"
658,,into the land of All-Delight by their strenuous sweet whirlwind;
659,,"and I find within myself such entire, yet humble, confidence"
660,,"of possessing every single element of power to carry them all out,"
661,,save the little paltry sum of money that would suffice to keep us
662,,clothed and fed in the meantime.
663,,
664,,"""I do not understand this."""
665,,==
666,,
667,,"Lanier's was an unknown name, and he would write only in obedience"
668,,"to his own sense of art, and he did not fit his wares"
669,,"to the taste of those who buy verse.  It was to comfort his wife,"
670,,in this period of greatest uncertainty whether he had not erred
671,,"in launching in the sea of literature, that he wrote again"
672,,a letter of frankest confession:
673,,
674,,==
675,,"""I will make to thee a little confession of faith, telling thee,"
676,,"my dearer self, in words, what I do not say to my not-so-dear-self"
677,,except in more modest feeling.
678,,
679,,"""Know, then, that disappointments were inevitable, and will still come"
680,,until I have fought the battle which every great artist has had to fight
681,,since time began.  This -- dimly felt while I was doubtful
682,,"of my own vocation and powers -- is clear as the sun to me now that I KNOW,"
683,,"through the fiercest tests of life, that I am in soul, and shall be"
684,,"in life and utterance, a great poet."
685,,
686,,"""The philosophy of my disappointments is, that there is so much CLEVERNESS"
687,,standing betwixt me and the public . . .  Richard Wagner is
688,,"sixty years old and over, and one-half of the most cultivated artists"
689,,"of the most cultivated art-land, quoad music, still think him an absurdity."
690,,Says Schumann in one of his letters:  `The publishers will not listen to me
691,,"for a moment'; and dost thou not remember Schubert, and Richter,"
692,,"and John Keats, and a sweet host more?"
693,,
694,,"""Now this is written because I sit here in my room daily,"
695,,"and picture THEE picturing ME worn, and troubled, or disheartened;"
696,,and because I do not wish thee to think up any groundless sorrow in thy soul.
697,,"Of course I have my keen sorrows, momentarily more keen than I would like"
698,,any one to know; but I thank God that in a knowledge of Him and of myself
699,,"which cometh to me daily in fresh revelations, I have a steadfast"
700,,"firmament of blue, in which all clouds soon dissolve."
701,,"I have wanted to say this several times of late, but it is not easy"
702,,"to bring one's self to talk so of one's self, even to one's dearer self."
703,,
704,,"""Have then . . . no fears nor anxieties in my behalf;"
705,,look upon all my disappointments as mere witnesses that art has no enemy

707,,It is of little consequence whether *I* fail; the *I* in the matter
708,,"is a small business:  `Que mon nom soit fle/tri, que la France soit libre!'"
709,,"quoth Danton; which is to say, interpreted by my environment:"
710,,"Let my name perish -- the poetry is good poetry and the music is good music,"
711,,"and beauty dieth not, and the heart that needs it will find it."""
712,,==
713,,
714,,"Having now given sacredly to art what vital forces his will could command,"
715,,"he devoted himself, with an intense energy, to the study"
716,,"of English literature, making himself a master of Anglo-Saxon"
717,,"and early English texts, and pursuing the study down to our own times."
718,,"He read freely, also, and with a scholar's nice eagerness,"
719,,"in further fields of study, but all with a view to gathering the stores"
720,,which a full man might draw from in the practice of poetic art;
721,,for he had that large compass which sees and seeks truths
722,,"in various excursions, and no field of history, or philology, or philosophy,"
723,,or science found him unsympathetic.  The opportunity for these studies
724,,"opened a new era in his development, while we begin to find"
725,,"a crystallization of that theory of formal verse which he adopted,"
726,,"and a growing power to master it.  To this artistic side of poetry he gave,"
727,,"from this time, very special study, until he had formulated it"
728,,"in his lectures in the Johns Hopkins University, and in his volume"
729,,"""The Science of English Verse""."
730,,
731,,But from this time the struggle against his fatal disease
732,,"was conscious and constant.  In May, 1874, he visited Florida"
733,,under an engagement to write a book for distribution by a railroad company.
734,,"Two months of the summer were spent with his family at Sunnyside, Ga.,"
735,,"where ""Corn"" was written.  This poem, published in `Lippincott's Magazine',"
736,,"was much copied, and made him known to many admirers."
737,,"No one of these was of so much value to him as Bayard Taylor,"
738,,at whose suggestion he was chosen to write the cantata
739,,"for the opening of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia,"
740,,and with whom he carried on a correspondence so long as Mr. Taylor lived.
741,,"To Mr. Taylor he owed introductions of value to other writers,"
742,,and for his sympathy and aid his letters prove that he felt very grateful.
743,,"In his first letter to Mr. Taylor, written August 7, 1875, he says:"
744,,
745,,==
746,,"""I could never describe to you what a mere drought and famine"
747,,"my life has been, as regards that multitude of matters which I fancy"
748,,"one absorbs when one is in an atmosphere of art, or when one"
749,,"is in conversational relation with men of letters, with travellers,"
750,,"with persons who have either seen, or written, or done large things."
751,,"Perhaps you know that, with us of the younger generation in the South"
752,,"since the war, pretty much the whole of life has been merely not dying."""
753,,==
754,,
755,,The selection of Mr. Lanier to write the Centennial Cantata
756,,"first brought his name into general notice; but its publication,"
757,,"in advance of the music by Dudley Buck, was the occasion"
758,,"of an immense amount of ridicule, more or less good-humored.  It was written"
759,,by a musician to go with music under the new relations of poetry to music
760,,"brought about by the great modern development of the orchestra,"
761,,and was not to be judged without its orchestral accompaniment.
762,,"The criticism it received pained our poet, but did not at all affect his faith"
763,,"in his theories of art.  To his father he wrote from New York, May 8, 1876:"
764,,
765,,==
766,,"""My experience in the varying judgments given about poetry . . ."
767,,"has all converged upon one solitary principle, and the experience"
768,,of the artist in all ages is reported by history to be of precisely
769,,"the same direction.  That principle is, that the artist shall put forth,"
770,,"humbly and lovingly, and without bitterness against opposition,"
771,,"the very best and highest that is within him, utterly regardless"
772,,of contemporary criticism.  What possible claim can contemporary criticism
773,,"set up to respect -- that criticism which crucified Jesus Christ,"
774,,"stoned Stephen, hooted Paul for a madman, tried Luther for a criminal,"
775,,"tortured Galileo, bound Columbus in chains, drove Dante into a hell of exile,"
776,,"made Shakespeare write the sonnet, `When in disgrace with fortune"
777,,"and men's eyes', gave Milton five pounds for `Paradise Lost',"
778,,"kept Samuel Johnson cooling his heels on Lord Chesterfield's doorstep,"
779,,"reviled Shelley as an unclean dog, killed Keats, cracked jokes on Glueck,"
780,,"Schubert, Beethoven, Berlioz, and Wagner, and committed so many other"
781,,impious follies and stupidities that a thousand letters like this
782,,"could not suffice even to catalogue them?"""
783,,==
784,,
785,,"Since first coming to the North in September, 1873,"
786,,Mr. Lanier had been separated from his family.  The two happy months with them
787,,after his visit to Florida was followed by several other briefer visits.
788,,"The winters of 1874-75 and 1875-76 found him still in Baltimore,"
789,,"playing at the Peabody, pursuing his studies and writing the ""Symphony"","
790,,"the ""Psalm of the West"", the ""Cantata"", and some shorter poems,"
791,,with a series of prose descriptive articles for `Lippincott's Magazine'.
792,,"In the summer of 1876 he called his family to join him at West Chester, Pa."
793,,This was authorized by an engagement to write the Life of Charlotte Cushman.
794,,"The work was begun, but the engagement was broken two months later,"
795,,owing to the illness of the friend of the family who was to provide
796,,the material from the mass of private correspondence.
797,,
798,,"Following this disappointment a new cold was incurred,"
799,,and his health became so much impaired that in November
800,,"the physicians told him he could not expect to live longer than May,"
801,,unless he sought a warmer climate.  About the middle of December
802,,"he started with his wife for the Gulf coast, and visited Tampa, Fla.,"
803,,gaining considerable benefit from the mild climate.  In April he ventured
804,,"North again, tarrying through the spring with his friends in Georgia;"
805,,"and, after a summer with his own family in Chadd's Ford, Pa.,"
806,,a final move was ventured in October to Baltimore as home.
807,,"Here he resumed his old place in the Peabody orchestra,"
808,,and continued to play there for three winters.
809,,
810,,"The Old English studies which he had pursued with such deep delight,"
811,,"he now put to use in a course of lectures on Elizabethan Verse,"
812,,given in a private parlor to a class of thirty ladies.
813,,"This was followed by a more ambitious ""Shakespeare Course"" of lectures"
814,,in the smaller hall of the Peabody Institute.  The undertaking
815,,"was immensely cheered on and greatly praised, but was a financial failure."
816,,"It opened the way, however, to one of the chiefest delights of his life,"
817,,his appointment as lecturer on English literature for the ensuing year
818,,at the Johns Hopkins University.  After some correspondence on the subject
819,,"with President Gilman, he received notice on his birthday, 1879,"
820,,"of his appointment, with a salary attached (it may be mentioned),"
821,,which gave him the first income assured in any year since his marriage.
822,,"This stimulated him to new life, for he was now barely able to walk"
823,,after a severe illness and renewed hemorrhage.
824,,
825,,The last two years had been more fruitful in verse than any
826,,"that had gone before, as he had now acquired confidence in his view"
827,,of the principles of art.  In 1875 he had written:
828,,
829,,==
830,,"""In this little song [`Special Pleading'] I have begun to dare"
831,,"to give myself some freedom in my own peculiar style, and have allowed myself"
832,,"to treat words, similes, and metres with such freedom as I desired."
833,,"The result convinces me that I can do so now safely."""
834,,==
835,,
836,,"Among his poems of this period may be mentioned ""A Song of the Future"","
837,,"""The Revenge of Hamish"", and -- what are excellent examples of the kind of art"
838,,"of which he had now gained command -- ""The Song of the Chattahoochee"","
839,,"and ""A Song of Love"".  It was at this time that he wrote"
840,,"""The Marshes of Glynn"", his most ambitious poem thus far,"
841,,"and one which he intended to follow with a series of ""Hymns of the Marshes"","
842,,which he left incomplete.
843,,
844,,"The summer of 1879 was spent at Rockingham Springs, Va.,"
845,,"and here, in six weeks, was begun and finished his volume,"
846,,"""Science of English Verse"".  Another severe illness prostrated him"
847,,"in September, but the necessity of work allowed no time for such distractions."
848,,In October he opened three lecture courses in young ladies' schools;
849,,"and through the winter, notwithstanding a most menacing illness"
850,,"about January 1st, he was in continuous rehearsals and concerts"
851,,"at the Peabody, and besides miscellaneous writings and studies,"
852,,"gave weekly ten lectures upon English literature, two of them public"
853,,"at the University, two to University classes, and the remaining six"
854,,"at private schools.  The University public lectures upon English Verse,"
855,,"more especially Shakespeare's, in part contained, and in part"
856,,"were introductory to, ""The Science of English Verse""."
857,,
858,,"The final consuming fever opened in May, 1880.  In July he went"
859,,"with Mrs. Lanier and her father to West Chester, Pa.,"
860,,"where a fourth son was born in August.  Unable to bear the fall climate,"
861,,"he returned, alone, early in September to his Baltimore home."
862,,
863,,This winter brought a hand-to-hand battle for life.  In December he came
864,,to the very door of death.  Before February he had essayed the open air
865,,to test himself for his second University lecture course.
866,,His improvement ceased on that first day of exposure.
867,,"Nevertheless, by April he had gone through the twelve lectures"
868,,"(there were to have been twenty), which were later published"
869,,"under the title ""The English Novel"".  A few of the earlier lectures"
870,,he penned himself; the rest he was obliged to dictate to his wife.
871,,"With the utmost care of himself, going in a closed carriage"
872,,"and sitting during his lecture, his strength was so exhausted"
873,,that the struggle for breath in the carriage on his return
874,,seemed each time to threaten the end.  Those who heard him
875,,"listened with a sort of fascinated terror, as in doubt"
876,,whether the hoarded breath would suffice to the end of the hour.
877,,
878,,"It was in December of this winter, when too feeble to raise his food"
879,,"to his mouth, with a fever temperature of 104 degrees,"
880,,"that he pencilled his last and greatest poem, ""Sunrise"","
881,,"one of his projected series of the ""Hymns of the Marshes""."
882,,It seemed as if he were in fear that he would die with it unuttered.
883,,
884,,"At the end of April, 1881, he made his last visit to New York,"
885,,to complete arrangements with Charles Scribner's Sons
886,,for the publication of other books of the King Arthur series.
887,,"But in a day or two aggravated illness compelled his wife to join him,"
888,,"and his medical adviser pronounced tent-life in a pure, high climate"
889,,to be the last hope.  His brother Clifford was summoned from Alabama
890,,"to assist in carrying out the plans for encamping near Asheville, N.C.,"
891,,whither the brothers went soon after the middle of May.
892,,By what seemed a hopeful coincidence he was tendered a commission
893,,"to write an account of the region in a railroad interest,"
894,,"as he had done six years before with Florida.  This provided a monthly salary,"
895,,which was to be the dependence of himself and family.
896,,"The materials for this book were collected, and the book thoroughly shaped"
897,,in the author's mind when July ended; but his increasing anguish
898,,"kept him from dictating, often from all speech for hours,"
899,,and he carried the plan away with him.
900,,
901,,"A site was chosen on the side of Richmond Hill, three miles from Asheville."
902,,"Clifford returned to Alabama, after seeing the tents pitched and floored,"
903,,and Mrs. Lanier came with her infant to take her place as nurse
904,,"for the invalid.  Early in July Mr. Lanier the father, with his wife,"
905,,joined them in the encampment.  As the passing weeks
906,,"brought no improvement to the sufferer he started, August 4th,"
907,,"on a carriage journey across the mountains with his wife,"
908,,"to test the climate of Lynn, Polk County, N. C.  There a deadly illness"
909,,"attacked him.  No return was possible, and Clifford was summoned by telegraph,"
910,,"and assisted his father in removing the encampment to Lynn.  Deceived by hope,"
911,,"and pressed by business cares, Clifford went home August 24th,"
912,,"and the father and his wife five days later, expecting to return soon."
913,,"Mrs. Lanier's own words, as written in the brief ""annals"" of his life"
914,,"furnished me, will tell the end:"

925,,"So the tragedy ended, the manly struggle carried on"
926,,with indomitable resolution against illness and want and care.
927,,Just when he seemed to have conquered success enough
928,,"to assure him a little leisure to write his poems,"
929,,then his feeble but resolute hold upon earth was exhausted.
930,,What he left behind him was written with his life-blood.
931,,"High above all the evils of the world he lived in a realm of ideal serenity,"

934,,This is not the place for an essay on the genius of Sidney Lanier.
935,,It is enough to call attention to some marked points
936,,in his character and work.
937,,
938,,He had more than Milton's love for music.  He sung like a bard
939,,to the accompaniment of a harp.  He lived in sweet sounds:
940,,"forever conscious of a ceaseless flow of melody which,"
941,,"if resisted for a while by business occupations, would swell again"
942,,in its natural current and break at his bidding into audible music.
943,,
944,,"We have the following recognition of his genius from Asger Hamerik,"
945,,his Director for six years in the Peabody Symphony Orchestra of Baltimore:
946,,
947,,==
948,,"""To him as a child in his cradle Music was given:  the heavenly gift"
949,,to feel and to express himself in tones.  His human nature
950,,"was like an enchanted instrument, a magic flute, or the lyre of Apollo,"
951,,needing but a breath or a touch to send its beauty out into the world.
952,,It was indeed irresistible that he should turn with those poetical feelings
953,,"which transcend language to the penetrating gentleness of the flute,"
954,,"or the infinite passion of the violin; for there was an agreement,"
955,,"a spiritual correspondence between his nature and theirs,"
956,,so that they mutually absorbed and expressed each other.
957,,"In his hands the flute no longer remained a mere material instrument,"
958,,but was transformed into a voice that set heavenly harmonies into vibration.
959,,"Its tones developed colors, warmth, and a low sweetness of unspeakable poetry;"
960,,"they were not only true and pure, but poetic, allegoric as it were,"
961,,suggestive of the depths and heights of being and of the delights
962,,which the earthly ear never hears and the earthly eye never sees.
963,,No doubt his firm faith in these lofty idealities gave him the power
964,,"to present them to our imaginations, and thus by the aid"
965,,of the higher language of Music to inspire others with that sense of beauty
966,,in which he constantly dwelt.
967,,
968,,"""His conception of music was not reached by an analytic study of note by note,"
969,,"but was intuitive and spontaneous; like a woman's reason:  he felt it so,"
970,,"because he felt it so, and his delicate perception required"
971,,no more logical form of reasoning.
972,,
973,,"""His playing appealed alike to the musically learned and to the unlearned --"
974,,for he would magnetize the listener; but the artist felt in his performance
975,,the superiority of the momentary living inspiration
976,,to all the rules and shifts of mere technical scholarship.
977,,"His art was not only the art of art, but an art above art."
978,,
979,,"""I will never forget the impression he made on me when he played"
980,,"the flute-concerto of Emil Hartmann at a Peabody symphony concert, in 1878:"
981,,"his tall, handsome, manly presence, his flute breathing noble sorrows,"
982,,"noble joys, the orchestra softly responding.  The audience was spellbound."
983,,"Such distinction, such refinement!  He stood, the master, the genius."""
984,,==
985,,
986,,"In the one novel which he wrote at the age of twenty-five,"
987,,he makes one of his characters say:
988,,
989,,==
990,,"""To make a HOME out of a household, given the raw materials --"
991,,"to wit, wife, children, a friend or two, and a house --"
992,,two other things are necessary.  These are a good fire and good music.
993,,"And inasmuch as we can do without the fire for half the year,"
994,,"I may say music is the one essential.""  ""Late explorers say they have found"
995,,"some nations that have no God; but I have not read of any that had no music."""
996,,"""Music means harmony, harmony means love, love means -- God!"""
997,,==
998,,
999,,The theoretical relation between music and poetry would hardly
1000,,have attracted his study had it not been that his mind
1001,,"was as truly philosophically and scientifically accurate,"
1002,,as it was poetically sensuous and imaginative.  In a letter
1003,,"to Mr. E. C. Stedman he complained that ""in all directions"
1004,,the poetic art was suffering from the shameful circumstance that criticism
1005,,"was without a scientific basis for even the most elementary of its judgments."""
1006,,
1007,,"Although the work was irksome to him, he could not go on"
1008,,"writing at hap-hazard, trusting to his own mere taste to decide what was good,"
1009,,until he had settled for himself scientifically what are the laws
1010,,of poetical construction.  This accounts for his exposition
1011,,"of the laws of beauty in that unique work, ""The Science of English Verse"","
1012,,"which was based on Dante's thought, ""The best conceptions cannot be"
1013,,"save where science and genius are.""  The book is chiefly taken up"
1014,,with a discussion of rhythm and tone-color in verse; and it is
1015,,well within the truth to say that it is the most complete and thorough
1016,,original investigation of the formal element in poetry in existence.
1017,,"The rhythm he treated as the marking of definite time measurements,"
1018,,"which could be indicated by bars in musical notation,"
1019,,"having their regular time and their regular number of notes,"
1020,,with their proper accent.  To this time measurement Mr. Lanier gave
1021,,the pre-eminence which Coleridge and other writers have given to accent.
1022,,He conceived of a line of poetry as consisting of a definite number
1023,,"of bars (or feet), each bar containing, in dactylic metre,"
1024,,"three equal ""eighth notes"", of which the first is accented,"
1025,,"or in iambic metre (which has the same ""triple"" time),"
1026,,"of one ""eighth note"", and one ""quarter note"", with the accent on the second."
1027,,"Thus the accented syllable is not necessarily ""longer"" than the unaccented,"
1028,,except as the rhythm happens to make it so.  This idea is very fully developed
1029,,and with great wealth of curious Old English illustrations.
1030,,"Under the designation of ""tone-color"" he treats very suggestively"
1031,,"of rhyme, alliteration, and vowel and consonant distribution,"
1032,,showing how the recurrence of euphonic vowels and consonants
1033,,secures that rich variety of tone-color which music gives in orchestration.
1034,,The work thus breaks away from the classic grammarian's tables
1035,,"of trochees and anapaests, and discusses the forms of poetry"
1036,,"in the terms of music; and of both tone-color and of rhythm he would say,"
1037,,"in the words of old King James, ""the very touch-stone whereof is music."""
1038,,
1039,,"Illustrations of these technical beauties of musical rhythm,"
1040,,"and vowel and consonant distribution, abound in Lanier's poetry."
1041,,"Such is the ""Song of the Chattahoochee"", which deserves a place"
1042,,"beside Tennyson's ""Brook"".  It strikes a higher key,"
1043,,and is scarcely less musical.  Such passages are numerous
1044,,"in his ""Sunrise on the Marshes"", as in the lines beginning,"
1045,,
1046,,"""Not slower than majesty moves,"""
1047,,
1048,,"or the other lines beginning,"
1049,,
1050,,"""Oh, what if a sound should be made!"""
1051,,
1052,,These investigations in the science of verse bore their fruit especially
1053,,"in the poems written during the last three or four years of his life,"
1054,,"when his sense of the solemn sacredness of Art became more profound,"
1055,,and he acquired a greater ease in putting into practice his theory of verse.
1056,,And this made him thoroughly original.  He was no imitator
1057,,"either of Tennyson or of Swinburne, though musically he is nearer to them"
1058,,than to any others of his day.  We constantly notice in his verse
1059,,"that dainty effect which the ear loves, and which comes"
1060,,"from deft marshalling of consonants and vowels, so that they shall add their"
1061,,suppler and subtler reinforcement to the steady infantry tramp of rhythm.
1062,,"Of this delicate art, which is much more than mere alliteration,"
1063,,"which is concerned with dominant accented vowels as well as consonants,"
1064,,"with the easy flow of liquids and fricatives, and with"
1065,,"the progressive opening or closing of the organs of articulation,"
1066,,"the laws are not easy to formulate, but examples abound in Lanier's poems."
1067,,
1068,,"Mr. Stedman, poet and critic, raises the question whether Lanier's"
1069,,"extreme conjunction of the artistic with the poetic temperament,"
1070,,"which he says no man has more clearly displayed, did not somewhat hamper"
1071,,"and delay his power of adequate expression.  Possibly,"
1072,,"but he was building not for the day, but for time.  He must work out"
1073,,"his laws of poetry, even if he had almost to invent its language;"
1074,,"for to him was given the power of analysis as well as of construction,"
1075,,and he was too conscientious to do anything else than to find out
1076,,"what was best and why, and then tell and teach it as he had learnt it,"
1077,,even if men said that his late spring was delaying bud and blossom.
1078,,
1079,,"But it would be a great mistake to find in Lanier only, or chiefly,"
1080,,"the artist.  He had the substance of poetry.  He possessed both elements,"
1081,,"as Stedman says, ""in extreme conjunction.""  He overflowed with fancy."
1082,,"His imagination needed to be held in check.  This was recognized in ""Corn"","
1083,,"and appears more fully in ""The Symphony"", the first productions"
1084,,which gave him wide recognition as a poet.  Illustrations too much abound
1085,,to allow selection.
1086,,
1087,,"And for the substance of invention there needed, in Lanier's judgment,"
1088,,large and exact knowledge of the world's facts.  A poet must be
1089,,"a student of things, truths, and men.  His own studies were wide"
1090,,and his scholarship accurate.  He did not believe that art comes
1091,,"all by instinct, without work.  In one of his keen criticisms of poets"
1092,,"he said of Edgar A. Poe, whom he esteemed more highly"
1093,,"than his countrymen are wont to do:  ""The trouble with Poe was,"
1094,,he did not KNOW enough.  He needed to know a good many more things
1095,,"in order to be a great poet.""  Lanier had ""a passion for the exact truth,"""
1096,,and all of it.
1097,,
1098,,The intense sacredness with which Lanier invested Art held him thrall
1099,,to the highest ethical ideas.  To him the most beautiful thing of all
1100,,"was Right.  He loved the words, ""the beauty of holiness"","
1101,,"and it pleased him to reverse the phrase and call it ""the holiness of beauty""."
1102,,"When one reads Lanier, he is reminded of two writers, Milton and Ruskin."
1103,,More than any other great English authors they are dominated by
1104,,this beauty of holiness.  Lanier was saturated with it.
1105,,It shines out of every line he wrote.  It is not that he never wrote
1106,,"a maudlin line, but that every thought was lofty.  That it must be so"
1107,,was a first postulate of his Art.  Hear his words to the students
1108,,of Johns Hopkins University:
1109,,
1110,,==
1111,,"""Let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination"
1112,,of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman;
1113,,"yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh,"
1114,,"if the brow be insincere, if in the minutest particular"
1115,,"the physical beauty suggests a moral ugliness, that sculptor --"
1116,,unless he be portraying a moral ugliness for a moral purpose --
1117,,may as well give over his marble for paving-stones.
1118,,"Time, whose judgments are inexorably moral, will not accept his work."
1119,,"For, indeed, we may say that he who has not yet perceived"
1120,,how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines
1121,,"which run back into a common ideal origin, and who therefore is not afire"
1122,,"with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty -- that he, in short,"
1123,,who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
1124,,"in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing,"
1125,,"burn as one fire, shine as one light within him; he is not yet"
1126,,"the great artist."""
1127,,==
1128,,
1129,,And he returns to the theme:
1130,,
1131,,==
1132,,"""Can not one say with authority to the young artist, whether working"
1133,,"in stone, in color, in tones, or in character-forms of the novel:"
1134,,So far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
1135,,"with your beautiful creation, go forward in the clear conviction"
1136,,"that unless you are suffused -- soul and body, one might say --"
1137,,with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love;
1138,,"that is, the love of all things in their proper relation;"
1139,,"unless you are suffused with this love, do not dare to meddle with beauty;"
1140,,"unless you are suffused with beauty, do not dare to meddle with love;"
1141,,"unless you are suffused with truth, do not dare to meddle with goodness;"
1142,,"in a word, unless you are suffused with truth, wisdom, goodness, and love,"
1143,,"abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist."""
1144,,==
1145,,
1146,,"Thus was it true, as was said of his work by his associate,"
1147,,"Dr. Wm. Hand Browne, that ""one thread of purpose runs through it all."
1148,,"This thread is found in his fervid love for his fellow-men,"
1149,,and his never ceasing endeavors to kindle an enthusiasm
1150,,"for beauty, purity, nobility of life, which he held it the poet's first duty"
1151,,"to teach and to exemplify.""  And so there came into his verse"
1152,,"a solemn, worshipful element, dominating it everywhere,"
1153,,and giving loftiness to its beauty.  For he was the democrat whom he described
1154,,"in contrast to Whitman's mere brawny, six-footed, open-shirted hero,"
1155,,whose strength was only that of the biceps:
1156,,
1157,,==
1158,,"""My democrat, the democrat whom I contemplate with pleasure,"
1159,,"the democrat who is to write or to read the poetry of the future,"
1160,,"may have a mere thread for his biceps, yet he shall be strong enough"
1161,,to handle hell; he shall play ball with the earth;
1162,,"and albeit his stature may be no more than a boy's,"
1163,,he shall still be taller than the great redwoods of California;
1164,,"his height shall be the height of great resolution,"
1165,,"and love, and faith, and beauty, and knowledge, and subtle meditation;"
1166,,"his head shall be forever among the stars."""
1167,,==
1168,,
1169,,This standard he could not forget in his judgments of artists.
1170,,"There was something in Whitman which ""refreshed him like harsh salt spray,"""
1171,,but to Whitman's lawlessness of art he was an utter foe.
1172,,We find it written down in his notes:
1173,,
1174,,==
1175,,"""Whitman is poetry's butcher.  Huge raw collops slashed from the rump"
1176,,"of poetry, and never mind gristle -- is what Whitman feeds our souls with."""
1177,,
1178,,"""As near as I can make it out, Whitman's argument seems to be, that,"
1179,,"because a prairie is wide, therefore debauchery is admirable,"
1180,,"and because the Mississippi is long, therefore every American is God."""
1181,,==
1182,,
1183,,So he says of Swinburne:
1184,,
1185,,==
1186,,"""He invited me to eat; the service was silver and gold,"
1187,,"but no food therein save pepper and salt."""
1188,,==
1189,,
1190,,And of William Morris:
1191,,
1192,,==
1193,,"""He caught a crystal cupful of the yellow light of sunset,"
1194,,"and persuading himself to dream it wine, drank it with a sort of smile."""
1195,,==
1196,,
1197,,"Though not what would be called a religious writer,"
1198,,"Lanier's large and deep thought took him to the deepest spiritual faiths,"
1199,,and the vastness of Nature drew him to a trust in the Infinite above us.
1200,,"Thus, his young search after God and truth brought him"
1201,,into the membership of the Presbyterian Church while at Oglethorpe College;
1202,,and though in after years his creed became broader than that
1203,,"imposed by the Church he had joined on its clergy, he could not outgrow"
1204,,the simple faith and consecration which are all it requires of its membership.
1205,,His college notebook records his earnestness;
1206,,
1207,,==
1208,,"""Liberty, patriotism, and civilization are on their knees"
1209,,"before the men of the South, and with clasped hands and straining eyes"
1210,,"are begging them to become Christians."""
1211,,==
1212,,
1213,,How naturally his large faith in God finds expression
1214,,"in his ""Marshes of Glynn""; or his reverent discipleship"
1215,,"of the great Artist and Master in his ""Ballad of the Trees and the Master"","
1216,,"or his ""The Crystal"", which was Christ.  Yet, with not a whit less"
1217,,"of worshipfulness and consecration, there grew in him a repugnance"
1218,,to the sectarianism of the Churches which put him somewhat out of sympathy
1219,,"with their formal organizations.  He wrote, in what may have been"
1220,,a sketch for a poem:
1221,,
1222,,==
1223,,"""I fled in tears from the men's ungodly quarrel about God."
1224,,"I fled in tears to the woods, and laid me down on the earth."
1225,,Then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground;
1226,,"and I looked and my cheek lay close to a violet.  Then my heart took courage,"
1227,,and I said:
1228,,
1229,,"`I know that thou art the word of my God, dear Violet:"
1230,,"And Oh, the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads."
1231,,Measure what space a violet stands above the ground;
1232,,"'Tis no further climbing that my soul and angels have to do than that.'"""
1233,,==
1234,,
1235,,"It was this quality, high and consecrate, as of a palmer with his vow,"
1236,,"this knightly valiance, this constant San Greal quest"
1237,,"after the lofty in character and aim, this passion for Good and Love,"
1238,,which fellows him rather with Milton and Ruskin than with
1239,,"the less sturdily built poets of his day, and which puts him"
1240,,in sharpest contrast with the school led by Swinburne --
1241,,with Rossetti and Morris as his followers hard after him --
1242,,"a school whose reed has a short gamut, and plays but two notes, Mors and Eros,"
1243,,hopeless death and lawless love.  But poetry is larger and finer
1244,,than they know.  Its face is toward the world's future;
1245,,it does not maunder after the flower-decked nymphs and yellow-skirted fays
1246,,that have forever fled -- and good riddance -- their haunted springs
1247,,"and tangled thickets.  It can feed on its growing sweet and fresh faiths,"
1248,,but will draw foul contagion from the rank mists that float
1249,,"over old and cold fables.  For all knowledge is food, as faith is wine,"
1250,,to a genius like Lanier.  A poet genius has great common sense.
1251,,"He lives in to-day and to-morrow, not in yesterday."
1252,,Such men were Shakespeare and Goethe.  The age of poetry is not past;
1253,,there is nothing in culture or science hostile to it.
1254,,"Milton was one of the world's great poets, but he was"
1255,,the most cultured and scholarly and statesmanlike man of his day.
1256,,He was no dreamer of dead dreams.  Neither was Lanier a dreamer.
1257,,"He came late to the opportunity he longed for, but when he came to it"
1258,,"he was a tremendous student, not of music alone, but of language,"
1259,,"of philosophy, and of science.  He loved science.  He was an inventor."
1260,,He had all the instincts and ambitions of this nineteenth century.
1261,,But that only made his range of poetic thought wider as his outlook
1262,,became larger.  The world is opening to the poet with every question
1263,,"the crucible asks of the elements, with every spectrum"
1264,,the prism steals from a star.  The old he has and all the new.
1265,,
1266,,"All this a man of Lanier's breadth understood fully,"
1267,,for he had a large capacity and he sought a full equipment.
1268,,Perhaps the most remarkable feature of his gifts was their complete symmetry.
1269,,"It is hard to tell what register of perception, or sensibility,"
1270,,"or wit, or will was lacking.  The constructive and the critical faculties,"
1271,,"the imaginative and the practical, balanced each other.  His wit and humor"
1272,,played upon the soberer background of his more recognized qualities.
1273,,The artist's withdrawn vision was at any need promptly exchanged
1274,,for the exercise of that scrupulous exactitude called for in the routine
1275,,"of the law-office or the post-office clerkship or other business relations,"
1276,,"or for the play of those energies exerted in camp or field.  There,"
1277,,"so his comrades testify, the most wearing drudgeries of a soldier's life"
1278,,"were always undertaken with notable alacrity and were thoroughly discharged,"
1279,,"when he would as invariably return, the task being done, to the gentle region"
1280,,of his own high thoughts and the artist's realm of beauty.
1281,,
1282,,"But how short was his day, and how slender his opportunity!"
1283,,"From the time he was of age he waged a constant, courageous, hopeless fight"
1284,,against adverse circumstance for room to live and write.
1285,,"Much very dear, and sweet, and most sympathetic helpfulness"
1286,,"he met in the city of his adoption, and from friends elsewhere,"
1287,,but he could not command the time and leisure which might have
1288,,lengthened his life and given him opportunity to write the music and the verse
1289,,"with which his soul was teeming.  Yet short as was his literary life,"
1290,,"and hindered though it were, its fruit will fill a large space"
1291,,in the garnering of the poetic art of our country.

3586,I.,
3587,I.,The storm that snapped our fate's one ship in twain
3588,I.,Hath blown my half o' the wreck from thine apart.
3589,I.,O Love! O Love! across the gray-waved main
3590,I.,"To thee-ward strain my eyes, my arms, my heart."
3591,I.,"I ask my God if e'en in His sweet place,"
3592,I.,"Where, by one waving of a wistful wing,"
3593,I.,My soul could straightway tremble face to face
3594,I.,"With thee, with thee, across the stellar ring --"
3595,I.,"Yea, where thine absence I could ne'er bewail"
3596,I.,Longer than lasts that little blank of bliss
3597,I.,"When lips draw back, with recent pressure pale,"
3598,I.,To round and redden for another kiss --
3599,I.,Would not my lonesome heart still sigh for thee
3600,I.,What time the drear kiss-intervals must be?
3601,I.,
3602,I.,
3603,II.,II.
3604,II.,
3605,II.,So do the mottled formulas of Sense
3606,II.,Glide snakewise through our dreams of Aftertime;
3607,II.,So errors breed in reeds and grasses dense
3608,II.,That bank our singing rivulets of rhyme.
3609,II.,By Sense rule Space and Time; but in God's Land
3610,II.,"Their intervals are not, save such as lie"
3611,II.,Betwixt successive tones in concords bland
3612,II.,Whose loving distance makes the harmony.
3613,II.,"Ah, there shall never come 'twixt me and thee"
3614,II.,"Gross dissonances of the mile, the year;"
3615,II.,But in the multichords of ecstasy
3616,II.,"Our souls shall mingle, yet be featured clear,"
3617,II.,"And absence, wrought to intervals divine,"
3618,II.,"Shall part, yet link, thy nature's tone and mine."

3621,III.,III.
3622,III.,
3623,III.,Look down the shining peaks of all my days
3624,III.,"Base-hidden in the valleys of deep night,"
3625,III.,So shalt thou see the heights and depths of praise
3626,III.,My love would render unto love's delight;
3627,III.,For I would make each day an Alp sublime
3628,III.,"Of passionate snow, white-hot yet icy-clear,"
3629,III.,-- One crystal of the true-loves of all time
3630,III.,Spiring the world's prismatic atmosphere;
3631,III.,And I would make each night an awful vale
3632,III.,"Deep as thy soul, obscure as modesty,"
3633,III.,With every star in heaven trembling pale
3634,III.,O'er sweet profounds where only Love can see.
3635,III.,"Oh, runs not thus the lesson thou hast taught? --"
3636,III.,"When life's all love, 'tis life:  aught else, 'tis naught."

3639,IV.,IV.

3641,IV.,"Let no man say, `He at his lady's feet"
3642,IV.,Lays worship that to Heaven alone belongs;
3643,IV.,"Yea, swings the incense that for God is meet"
3644,IV.,In flippant censers of light lover's songs.'
3645,IV.,"Who says it, knows not God, nor love, nor thee;"
3646,IV.,For love is large as is yon heavenly dome:
3647,IV.,"In love's great blue, each passion is full free"
3648,IV.,To fly his favorite flight and build his home.
3649,IV.,Did e'er a lark with skyward-pointing beak
3650,IV.,Stab by mischance a level-flying dove?
3651,IV.,"Wife-love flies level, his dear mate to seek:"
3652,IV.,God-love darts straight into the skies above.
3653,IV.,"Crossing, the windage of each other's wings"
3654,IV.,But speeds them both upon their journeyings.

4820,III.,Once on a time a soul

4825,III.,How `life was the dropping and death the drying
4826,III.,Of a Tear that fell in a day when God was sighing.'
4827,III.,And ever Time tossed him bitterly to and fro
4828,III.,As a shuttle inlaying a perilous warp of woe
4829,III.,"In the woof of things from terminal snow to snow,"
4830,III.,"Till, lo!"
4831,III.,Rest.
4832,III.,"And he sank on the grass of the earth as a lark on its nest,"
4833,III.,And he lay in the midst of the way from the east to the west.
4834,III.,"Then the East came out from the east and the West from the west,"
4835,III.,"And, behold! in the gravid deeps of the lower dark,"
4836,III.,"While, above, the wind was fanning the dawn as a spark,"
4837,III.,The East and the West took form as the wings of a lark.
4838,III.,"One wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost Past,"
4839,III.,And one with the dreams of a prophet; and both sailed fast
4840,III.,And met where the sorrowful Soul on the earth was cast.
4841,III.,"Then a Voice said:  `Thine, if thou lovest enough to use;'"
4842,III.,But another:  `To fly and to sing is pain:  refuse!'
4843,III.,"Then the Soul said:  `Come, O my wings!  I cannot but choose.'"
4844,III.,"And the Soul was a-tremble like as a new-born thing,"
4845,III.,"Till the spark of the dawn wrought a conscience in heart as in wing,"
4846,III.,"Saying, `Thou art the lark of the dawn; it is time to sing.'"
4847,III.,
4848,III.,Then that artist began in a lark's low circling to pass;
4849,III.,And first he sang at the height of the top of the grass
4850,III.,A song of the herds that are born and die in the mass.
4851,III.,And next he sang a celestial-passionate round
4852,III.,"At the height of the lips of a woman above the ground,"
4853,III.,"How `Love was a fair true Lady, and Death a wild hound,"
4854,III.,"And she called, and he licked her hand and with girdle was bound.'"
4855,III.,"And then with a universe-love he was hot in the wings,"
4856,III.,And the sun stretched beams to the worlds as the shining strings
4857,III.,Of the large hid harp that sounds when an all-lover sings;
4858,III.,"And the sky's blue traction prevailed o'er the earth's in might,"
4859,III.,And the passion of flight grew mad with the glory of height
4860,III.,And the uttering of song was like to the giving of light;
4861,III.,"And he learned that hearing and seeing wrought nothing alone,"
4862,III.,"And that music on earth much light upon Heaven had thrown,"
4863,III.,And he melted-in silvery sunshine with silvery tone;
4864,III.,And the spirals of music e'er higher and higher he wound
4865,III.,Till the luminous cinctures of melody up from the ground
4866,III.,Arose as the shaft of a tapering tower of sound --
4867,III.,Arose for an unstricken full-finished Babel of sound.
4868,III.,"But God was not angry, nor ever confused his tongue,"
4869,III.,For not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung
4870,III.,The song of all men and all things that the all-lover sung.
4871,III.,"Then he paused at the top of his tower of song on high,"
4872,III.,And the voice of the God of the artist from far in the sky
4873,III.,"Said, `Son, look down:  I will cause that a Time gone by"
4874,III.,"Shall pass, and reveal his heart to thy loving eye.'"
4875,III.,
4876,III.,"Far spread, below,"
4877,III.,The sea that fast hath locked in his loose flow
4878,III.,All secrets of Atlantis' drowned woe
4879,III.,"Lay bound about with night on every hand,"
4880,III.,Save down the eastern brink a shining band
4881,III.,Of day made out a little way from land.
4882,III.,Then from that shore the wind upbore a cry:
4883,III.,"`Thou Sea, thou Sea of Darkness! why, oh why"
4884,III.,Dost waste thy West in unthrift mystery?'
4885,III.,"But ever the idiot sea-mouths foam and fill,"
4886,III.,"And never a wave doth good for man or ill,"
4887,III.,"And Blank is king, and Nothing hath his will;"
4888,III.,And like as grim-beaked pelicans level file
4889,III.,Across the sunset toward their nightly isle
4890,III.,"On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile,"
4891,III.,So leanly sails the day behind the day
4892,III.,"To where the Past's lone Rock o'erglooms the spray,"
4893,III.,And down its mortal fissures sinks away.
4894,III.,
4895,III.,"Master, Master, break this ban:"
4896,III.,The wave lacks Thee.
4897,III.,"Oh, is it not to widen man"
4898,III.,Stretches the sea?
4899,III.,"Oh, must the sea-bird's idle van"
4900,III.,Alone be free?
4901,III.,

4905,III.,"Set rigid and most pale,"
4906,III.,About the night doth peer and peep
4907,III.,In a dream of an ancient tale.
4908,III.,
4909,III.,"Lo, here is made a hasty cry:"
4910,III.,"`Land, land, upon the west! --"
4911,III.,"God save such land!  Go by, go by:"
4912,III.,"Here may no mortal rest,"

4914,III.,And grind the glacier's breast.'
4915,III.,
4916,III.,"The sail goeth limp:  hey, flap and strain!"
4917,III.,Round eastward slanteth the mast;

7366,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",I glanced in all the eyes and marked that some
7367,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","Did glitter with a flame of lunacy,"

7387,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",To lips that writhed but drank with eagerness.
7388,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","And some played curious viols, shaped like hearts"
7389,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","And stringed with loves, to light and ribald tunes,"
7390,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?","And other hands slit throats with knives,"

9011,XII.,
9012,XII.,"`Sunrise', Mr. Lanier's latest completed poem, was written"

9014,XII.,and the hand which first pencilled its lines had not strength

9052,XII.,"of his consciously-developing art-life.  This life, the musician's and poet's,"

9114,XII.,
9115,XII.,`A Ballad of Trees and the Master' was conceived as an interlude
9116,XII.,"of the latest `Hymn of the Marshes', `Sunrise', although written earlier."
9117,XII.,"In the author's first copy and first revision of that `Hymn',"
9118,XII.,"the `Ballad' was incorporated, following the invocation to the trees"
9119,XII.,which closes with:

9121,XII.,"""And there, oh there"
9122,XII.,"As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air,"
9123,XII.,"Pray me a myriad prayer."""
9124,XII.,
9125,XII.,In Mr. Lanier's final copy the `Ballad' is omitted.

9168,XII.,I have often heard described as `under the hack':  `She's got him
9169,XII.,"under the hack.'  So, when a man has lost spirit from any cause,"

9181,XII.,
9182,XII.,Although `The Jacquerie' remained a fragment for thirteen years
9183,XII.,Mr. Lanier's interest in the subject never abated.  Far on in this interval
9184,XII.,he is found planning for leisure to work out in romance
