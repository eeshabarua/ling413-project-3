166,INDEX,When Day Is Done
167,INDEX,
168,INDEX,
169,INDEX,"When day is done and the night slips down,"
170,INDEX,"And I've turned my back on the busy town,"
171,INDEX,And come once more to the welcome gate
172,INDEX,"Where the roses nod and the children wait,"
173,INDEX,I tell myself as I see them smile
174,INDEX,That life is good and its tasks worth while.
175,INDEX,
176,INDEX,When day is done and I've come once more
177,INDEX,"To my quiet street and the friendly door,"
178,INDEX,Where the Mother reigns and the children play
179,INDEX,"And the kettle sings in the old-time way,"
180,INDEX,I throw my coat on a near-by chair
181,INDEX,And say farewell to my pack of care.
182,INDEX,
183,INDEX,"When day is done, all the hurt and strife"
184,INDEX,"And the selfishness and the greed of life,"
185,INDEX,Are left behind in the busy town;
186,INDEX,I've ceased to worry about renown
187,INDEX,"Or gold or fame, and I'm just a dad,"
188,INDEX,Content to be with his girl and lad.
189,INDEX,
190,INDEX,"Whatever the day has brought of care,"
191,INDEX,"Here love and laughter are mine to share,"
192,INDEX,Here I can claim what the rich desire--
193,INDEX,"Rest and peace by a ruddy fire,"
194,INDEX,The welcome words which the loved ones speak
195,INDEX,And the soft caress of a baby's cheek.
196,INDEX,
197,INDEX,"When day is done and I reach my gate,"
198,INDEX,"I come to a realm where there is no hate,"
199,INDEX,"For here, whatever my worth may be,"
200,INDEX,Are those who cling to their faith in me;
201,INDEX,"And with love on guard at my humble door,"
202,INDEX,I have all that the world has struggled for.
203,INDEX,
204,INDEX,
205,INDEX,
206,INDEX,
207,INDEX,The Simple Things
208,INDEX,
209,INDEX,
210,INDEX,I would not be too wise--so very wise
211,INDEX,"That I must sneer at simple songs and creeds,"
212,INDEX,And let the glare of wisdom blind my eyes
213,INDEX,To humble people and their humble needs.
214,INDEX,
215,INDEX,I would not care to climb so high that I
216,INDEX,"Could never hear the children at their play,"
217,INDEX,"Could only see the people passing by,"
218,INDEX,And never hear the cheering words they say.
219,INDEX,
220,INDEX,I would not know too much--too much to smile
221,INDEX,"At trivial errors of the heart and hand,"
222,INDEX,"Nor be too proud to play the friend the while,"
223,INDEX,Nor cease to help and know and understand.
224,INDEX,
225,INDEX,"I would not care to sit upon a throne,"
226,INDEX,"Or build my house upon a mountain-top,"
227,INDEX,Where I must dwell in glory all alone
228,INDEX,And never friend come in or poor man stop.
229,INDEX,
230,INDEX,God grant that I may live upon this earth
231,INDEX,And face the tasks which every morning brings
232,INDEX,And never lose the glory and the worth
233,INDEX,Of humble service and the simple things.
234,INDEX,
235,INDEX,
236,INDEX,
237,INDEX,
238,INDEX,Life Is What We Make It
239,INDEX,
240,INDEX,
241,INDEX,Life is a jest;
242,INDEX,Take the delight of it.
243,INDEX,Laughter is best;
244,INDEX,Sing through the night of it.
245,INDEX,Swiftly the tear
246,INDEX,And the hurt and the ache of it
247,INDEX,Find us down here;
248,INDEX,Life must be what we make of it.
249,INDEX,
250,INDEX,Life is a song;
251,INDEX,Dance to the thrill of it.
252,INDEX,"Grief's hours are long,"
253,INDEX,And cold is the chill of it.
254,INDEX,Joy is man's need;
255,INDEX,Let us smile for the sake of it.
256,INDEX,This be our creed:
257,INDEX,Life must be what we make of it.
258,INDEX,
259,INDEX,Life is a soul;
260,INDEX,"The virtue and vice of it,"
261,INDEX,"Strife for a goal,"
262,INDEX,And man's strength is the price of it.
263,INDEX,"Your life and mine,"
264,INDEX,The bare bread and the cake of it
265,INDEX,End in this line:
266,INDEX,Life must be what we make of it.
267,INDEX,
268,INDEX,
269,INDEX,
270,INDEX,
271,INDEX,What We Need
272,INDEX,
273,INDEX,
274,INDEX,"We were settin' there an' smokin' of our pipes, discussin' things,"
275,INDEX,"Like licker, votes for wimmin, an' the totterin'thrones o' kings,"
276,INDEX,When he ups an' strokes his whiskers with his hand an' says t'me:
277,INDEX,"""Changin' laws an' legislatures ain't, as fur as I can see,"
278,INDEX,"Goin' to make this world much better, unless somehow we can"
279,INDEX,Find a way to make a better an' a finer sort o' man.
280,INDEX,
281,INDEX,"""The trouble ain't with statutes or with systems--not at all;"
282,INDEX,It's with humans jest like we air an' their petty ways an' small.
283,INDEX,We could stop our writin' law-books an' our regulatin' rules
284,INDEX,If a better sort of manhood was the product of our schools.
285,INDEX,For the things that we air needin' ain't no writin' from a pen
286,INDEX,"Or bigger guns to shoot with, but a bigger typeof men."
287,INDEX,
288,INDEX,"""I reckon all these problems air jest ornery like the weeds."
289,INDEX,"They grow in soil that oughta nourish only decent deeds,"
290,INDEX,"An' they waste our time an' fret us when, if we were thinkin' straight"
291,INDEX,"An' livin' right, they wouldn't be so terrible an' great."
292,INDEX,"A good horse needs no snaffle, an' a good man, I opine,"
293,INDEX,Doesn't need a law to check him or to force him into line.
294,INDEX,
295,INDEX,"""If we ever start in teachin' to our children, year by year,"
296,INDEX,"How to live with one another, there'll be less o' trouble here."
297,INDEX,"If we'd teach 'em how to neighbor an' to walk in honor's ways,"
298,INDEX,We could settle every problem which the mind o' man can raise.
299,INDEX,"What we're needin' isn't systems or some regulatin' plan,"
300,INDEX,"But a bigger an' a finer an' a truer type o' man."""

305,INDEX,A Boy and His Dad
306,INDEX,
307,INDEX,
308,INDEX,A boy and his dad on a fishing-trip--
309,INDEX,There is a glorious fellowship!
310,INDEX,Father and son and the open sky
311,INDEX,"And the white clouds lazily drifting by,"
312,INDEX,And the laughing stream as it runs along
313,INDEX,"With the clicking reel like a martial song,"
314,INDEX,And the father teaching the youngster gay
315,INDEX,How to land a fish in the sportsman's way.
316,INDEX,
317,INDEX,I fancy I hear them talking there
318,INDEX,"In an open boat, and the speech is fair;"
319,INDEX,And the boy is learning the ways of men
320,INDEX,From the finest man in his youthful ken.
321,INDEX,"Kings, to the youngster, cannot compare"
322,INDEX,With the gentle father who's with him there.
323,INDEX,And the greatest mind of the human race
324,INDEX,Not for one minute could take his place.
325,INDEX,
326,INDEX,"Which is happier, man or boy?"
327,INDEX,"The soul of the father is steeped in joy,"
328,INDEX,"For he's finding out, to his heart's delight,"
329,INDEX,That his son is fit for the future fight.
330,INDEX,"He is learning the glorious depths of him,"
331,INDEX,"And the thoughts he thinks and his every whim,"
332,INDEX,"And he shall discover, when night comes on,"
333,INDEX,How close he has grown to his little son.
334,INDEX,
335,INDEX,A boy and his dad on a fishing-trip--
336,INDEX,"Oh, I envy them, as I see them there"
337,INDEX,"Under the sky in the open air,"
338,INDEX,"For out of the old, old long-ago"
339,INDEX,"Come the summer days that I used to know,"
340,INDEX,When I learned life's truths from my father's lips
341,INDEX,As I shared the joy of his fishing-trips--
342,INDEX,Builders of life's companionship!
343,INDEX,
344,INDEX,
345,INDEX,
346,INDEX,
347,INDEX,If I Had Youth
348,INDEX,
349,INDEX,
350,INDEX,If I had youth I'd bid the world to try me;
351,INDEX,I'd answer every challenge to my will.
352,INDEX,"And though the silent mountains should defy me,"
353,INDEX,I'd try to make them subject to my skill.
354,INDEX,I'd keep my dreams and follow where they led me;
355,INDEX,I'd glory in the hazards which abound.
356,INDEX,"I'd eat the simple fare privations fed me,"
357,INDEX,And gladly make my couch upon the ground.
358,INDEX,
359,INDEX,"If I had youth I'd ask no odds of distance,"
360,INDEX,Nor wish to tread the known and level ways.
361,INDEX,"I'd want to meet and master strong resistance,"
362,INDEX,And in a worth-while struggle spend my days.
363,INDEX,I'd seek the task which calls for full endeavor;
364,INDEX,I'd feel the thrill of battle in my veins.
365,INDEX,"I'd bear my burden gallantly, and never"
366,INDEX,Desert the hills to walk on common plains.
367,INDEX,
368,INDEX,If I had youth no thought of failure lurking
369,INDEX,Beyond to-morrow's dawn should fright my soul.
370,INDEX,Let failure strike--it still should find me working
371,INDEX,With faith that I should some day reach my goal.
372,INDEX,I'd dice with danger--aye!--and glory in it;
373,INDEX,I'd make high stakes the purpose of my throw.
374,INDEX,"I'd risk for much, and should I fail to win it,"
375,INDEX,I would not ever whimper at the blow.
376,INDEX,
377,INDEX,If I had youth no chains of fear should bind me;
378,INDEX,I'd brave the heights which older men must shun.
379,INDEX,"I'd leave the well-worn lanes of life behind me,"
380,INDEX,And seek to do what men have never done.
381,INDEX,Rich prizes wait for those who do not waver;
382,INDEX,The world needs men to battle for the truth.
383,INDEX,It calls each hour for stronger hearts and braver.
384,INDEX,This is the age for those who still have youth!
385,INDEX,
386,INDEX,
387,INDEX,
388,INDEX,
389,INDEX,Looking Back
390,INDEX,
391,INDEX,
392,INDEX,I might have been rich if I'd wanted the gold instead of the friendships
393,INDEX,I've made.
394,INDEX,I might have had fame if I'd sought for renown in the hours when I
395,INDEX,purposely played.
396,INDEX,"Now I'm standing to-day on the far edge of life, and I'm just looking"
397,INDEX,backward to see
398,INDEX,"What I've done with the years and the days that were mine, and all that"
399,INDEX,has happened to me.
400,INDEX,
401,INDEX,I haven't built much of a fortune to leave to those who shall carry my
402,INDEX,"name,"
403,INDEX,And nothing I've done shall entitle me now to a place on the tablets of
404,INDEX,fame.
405,INDEX,But I've loved the great sky and its spaces of blue; I've lived with the
406,INDEX,birds and the trees;
407,INDEX,I've turned from the splendor of silver and gold to share in such pleasures
408,INDEX,as these.
409,INDEX,
410,INDEX,I've given my time to the children who came; together we've romped and
411,INDEX,"we've played,"
412,INDEX,And I wouldn't exchange the glad hours spent with them for the money that
413,INDEX,I might have made.
414,INDEX,"I chose to be known and be loved by the few, and was deaf to the plaudits"
415,INDEX,of men;
416,INDEX,And I'd make the same choice should the chance come to me to live my life
417,INDEX,over again.
418,INDEX,
419,INDEX,"I've lived with my friends and I've shared in their joys, known sorrow with"
420,INDEX,all of its tears;
421,INDEX,"I have harvested much from my acres of life, though some say I've"
422,INDEX,squandered my years.
423,INDEX,"For much that is fine has been mine to enjoy, and I think I have lived to"
424,INDEX,"my best,"
425,INDEX,"And I have no regret, as I'm nearing the end, for the gold that I might"
426,INDEX,have possessed.
427,INDEX,
428,INDEX,
429,INDEX,
430,INDEX,
431,INDEX,God Made This Day for Me
432,INDEX,
433,INDEX,
434,INDEX,Jes' the sort o' weather and jes' the sort of sky
435,INDEX,"Which seem to suit my fancy, with the white clouds driftin' by"
436,INDEX,"On a sea o' smooth blue water. Oh, I ain't an egotist,"
437,INDEX,"With an ""I"" in all my thinkin', but I'm willin' to insist"
438,INDEX,That the Lord who made us humans an' the birds in every tree
439,INDEX,Knows my special sort o' weather an' he made this day fer me.
440,INDEX,
441,INDEX,"This is jes' my style o' weather--sunshine floodin' all the place,"
442,INDEX,An' the breezes from the eastward blowin' gently on my face;
443,INDEX,An' the woods chock full o' singin' till you'd think birds never had
444,INDEX,A single care to fret 'em or a grief to make 'em sad.
445,INDEX,"Oh, I settle down contented in the shadow of a tree,"
446,INDEX,An' tell myself right proudly that the day was made fer me.
447,INDEX,
448,INDEX,"It's my day, my sky an' sunshine, an' the temper o' the breeze--"
449,INDEX,Here's the weather I would fashion could I run things as I please:
450,INDEX,"Beauty dancin' all around me, music ringin' everywhere,"
451,INDEX,"Like a weddin' celebration--why, I've plumb fergot my care"
452,INDEX,"An' the tasks I should be doin' fer the rainy days to be,"
453,INDEX,While I'm huggin' the delusion that God made this day fer me.
454,INDEX,
455,INDEX,
456,INDEX,
457,INDEX,
458,INDEX,The Grate Fire
459,INDEX,
460,INDEX,
461,INDEX,I'm sorry for a fellow if he cannot look and see
462,INDEX,In a grate fire's friendly flaming all the joys which used to be.
463,INDEX,If in quiet contemplation of a cheerful ruddy blaze
464,INDEX,"He sees nothing there recalling all his happy yesterdays,"
465,INDEX,"Then his mind is dead to fancy and his life is bleak and bare,"
466,INDEX,And he's doomed to walk the highways that are always thick with care.
467,INDEX,
468,INDEX,"When the logs are dry as tinder and they crackle with the heat,"
469,INDEX,"And the sparks, like merry children, come a-dancing round my feet,"
470,INDEX,"In the cold, long nights of autumn I can sit before the blaze"
471,INDEX,And watch a panorama born of all my yesterdays.
472,INDEX,"I can leave the present burdens and the moment's bit of woe,"
473,INDEX,And claim once more the gladness of the bygone long-ago.
474,INDEX,
475,INDEX,No loved ones ever vanish from the grate fire's merry throng;
476,INDEX,No hands in death are folded and no lips are stilled to song.
477,INDEX,All the friends who were are living--like the sparks that fly about
478,INDEX,"They come romping out to greet me with the same old merry shout,"
479,INDEX,"Till it seems to me I'm playing once again on boyhood's stage,"
480,INDEX,Where there's no such thing as sorrow and there's no such thing as age.
481,INDEX,
482,INDEX,"I can be the care-free schoolboy! I can play the lover, too!"
483,INDEX,"I can walk through Maytime orchards with the old sweetheart I knew,"
484,INDEX,"I can dream the glad dreams over, greet the old familiar friends"
485,INDEX,In a land where there's no parting and the laughter never ends.
486,INDEX,"All the gladness life has given from a grate fire I reclaim,"
487,INDEX,And I'm sorry for the fellow-who sees nothing there but flame.
488,INDEX,
489,INDEX,
490,INDEX,
491,INDEX,
492,INDEX,The Homely Man
493,INDEX,
494,INDEX,
495,INDEX,Looks as though a cyclone hit him--
496,INDEX,Can't buy clothes that seem to fit him;
497,INDEX,"An' his cheeks are rough like leather,"
498,INDEX,Made for standin' any weather.
499,INDEX,"Outwards he was fashioned plainly,"
500,INDEX,"Loose o' joint an' blamed ungainly,"
501,INDEX,But I'd give a lot if I'd
502,INDEX,Been built half as fine inside.
503,INDEX,
504,INDEX,Best thing I can tell you of him
505,INDEX,Is the way the children love him.
506,INDEX,Now an' then I get to thinkin'
507,INDEX,He's much like old Abe Lincoln;
508,INDEX,Homely like a gargoyle graven--
509,INDEX,Worse'n that when he's unshaven;
510,INDEX,But I'd take his ugly phiz
511,INDEX,Jes' to have a heart like his.
512,INDEX,
513,INDEX,"I ain't over-sentimental,"
514,INDEX,But old Blake is so blamed gentle
515,INDEX,An' so thoughtfull-like of others
516,INDEX,He reminds us of our mothers.
517,INDEX,Rough roads he is always smoothing
518,INDEX,"An' his way is, Oh, so soothin',"
519,INDEX,That he takes away the sting
520,INDEX,When your heart is sorrowing.
521,INDEX,
522,INDEX,Children gather round about him
523,INDEX,Like they can't get on without him.
524,INDEX,"An' the old depend upon him,"
525,INDEX,"Pilin' all their burdens on him,"
526,INDEX,Like as though the thing that grieves 'em
527,INDEX,Has been lifted when he leaves 'em.
528,INDEX,"Homely? That can't be denied,"
529,INDEX,But he's glorious inside.

534,INDEX,The Joys We Miss
535,INDEX,
536,INDEX,
537,INDEX,There never comes a lonely day but that we miss the laughing ways
538,INDEX,Of those who used to walk with us through all our happy yesterdays.
539,INDEX,We seldom miss the earthly great--the famous men that life has known--
540,INDEX,"But, as the years go racing by, we miss the friends we used to own."
541,INDEX,
542,INDEX,The chair wherein he used to sit recalls the kindly father true
543,INDEX,"For, Oh, so filled with fun he was, and, Oh, so very much he knew!"
544,INDEX,And as we face the problems grave with which the years of life are filled.
545,INDEX,We miss the hand which guided us and miss the voice forever stilled.
546,INDEX,
547,INDEX,"We little guessed how much he did to smooth our pathway day by day,"
548,INDEX,"How much of joy he brought to us, how much of care he brushed away;"
549,INDEX,"But now that we must tread alone the thorough-fare of life, we find"
550,INDEX,How many burdens we were spared by him who was so brave and kind.
551,INDEX,
552,INDEX,"Death robs the living, not the dead--they sweetly sleep whose tasks are"
553,INDEX,done;
554,INDEX,But we are weaker than before who still must live and labor on.
555,INDEX,"For when come care and grief to us, and heavy burdens bring us woe,"
556,INDEX,"We miss the smiling, helpful friends on whom we leaned long years ago."
557,INDEX,
558,INDEX,"We miss the happy, tender ways of those who brought us mirth and cheer;"
559,INDEX,We never gather round the hearth but that we wish our friends were near;
560,INDEX,"For peace is born of simple things--a kindly word, a goodnight kiss,"
561,INDEX,"The prattle of a babe, and love--these are the vanished joys we miss."

571,INDEX,"Nor where he fares, nor how his cares"
572,INDEX,"And troubles may beset him,"
573,INDEX,"If books have won the love of him,"
574,INDEX,"Whatever fortune hands him,"
575,INDEX,"He'll always own, when he's alone,"
576,INDEX,A friend who understands him.
577,INDEX,
578,INDEX,"Though other friends may come and go,"
579,INDEX,"And some may stoop to treason,"
580,INDEX,"His books remain, through loss or gain,"
581,INDEX,And season after season
582,INDEX,"The faithful friends for every mood,"
583,INDEX,"His joy and sorrow sharing,"
584,INDEX,"For old time's sake, they'll lighter make"
585,INDEX,The burdens he is bearing.
586,INDEX,
587,INDEX,"Oh, he has counsel at his side,"
588,INDEX,"And wisdom for his duty,"
589,INDEX,"And laughter gay for hours of play,"
590,INDEX,"And tenderness and beauty,"
591,INDEX,"And fellowship divinely rare,"
592,INDEX,"True friends who never doubt him,"

599,INDEX,When Sorrow Comes
600,INDEX,
601,INDEX,
602,INDEX,"When sorrow comes, as come it must,"
603,INDEX,In God a man must place his trust.
604,INDEX,There is no power in mortal speech
605,INDEX,"The anguish of his soul to reach,"
606,INDEX,"No voice, however sweet and low,"
607,INDEX,Can comfort him or ease the blow.
608,INDEX,
609,INDEX,He cannot from his fellowmen
610,INDEX,Take strength that will sustain him then.
611,INDEX,"With all that kindly hands will do,"
612,INDEX,"And all that love may offer, too,"
613,INDEX,He must believe throughout the test
614,INDEX,That God has willed it for the best.
615,INDEX,
616,INDEX,We who would be his friends are dumb;
617,INDEX,Words from our lips but feebly come;
618,INDEX,"We feel, as we extend our hands,"
619,INDEX,That one Power only understands
620,INDEX,And truly knows the reason why
621,INDEX,So beautiful a soul must die.
622,INDEX,
623,INDEX,We realize how helpless then
624,INDEX,Are all the gifts of mortal men.
625,INDEX,No words which we have power to say
626,INDEX,Can take the sting of grief away--
627,INDEX,That Power which marks the sparrow's fall
628,INDEX,Must comfort and sustain us all.
629,INDEX,
630,INDEX,"When sorrow comes, as come it must,"
631,INDEX,In God a man must place his trust.
632,INDEX,"With all the wealth which he may own,"
633,INDEX,"He cannot meet the test alone,"
634,INDEX,And only he may stand serene
635,INDEX,Who has a faith on which to lean.

640,INDEX,Golf Luck
641,INDEX,
642,INDEX,
643,INDEX,As a golfer I'm not one who cops the money;
644,INDEX,I shall always be a member of the dubs;
645,INDEX,There are times my style is positively funny;
646,INDEX,I am awkward in my handling of the clubs.
647,INDEX,"I am not a skillful golfer, nor a plucky,"
648,INDEX,But this about myself I proudly say--
649,INDEX,"When I win a hole by freaky stroke or lucky,"
650,INDEX,I never claim I played the shot that way.
651,INDEX,
652,INDEX,"There are times, despite my blundering behavior,"
653,INDEX,When fortune seems to follow at my heels;
654,INDEX,"Now and then I play supremely in her favor,"
655,INDEX,And she lets me pull the rankest sort of steals;
656,INDEX,"She'll give to me the friendliest assistance,"
657,INDEX,"I'll jump a ditch at times when I should not,"
658,INDEX,I'll top the ball and get a lot of distance--
659,INDEX,But I don't claim that's how I played the shot.
660,INDEX,
661,INDEX,"I've hooked a ball when just that hook I needed,"
662,INDEX,And wondered how I ever turned the trick;
663,INDEX,"I've thanked my luck for what a friendly tree did,"
664,INDEX,Although my fortune made my rival sick;
665,INDEX,"Sometimes my shots turn out just as I planned 'em,"
666,INDEX,"The sort of shots I usually play,"
667,INDEX,"But when up to the cup I chance to land 'em,"
668,INDEX,I never claim I played 'em just that way.
669,INDEX,
670,INDEX,There's little in my game that will commend me;
671,INDEX,I'm not a shark who shoots the course in par;
672,INDEX,I need good fortune often to befriend me;
673,INDEX,I have my faults and know just what they are.
674,INDEX,"I play golf in a desperate do-or-die way,"
675,INDEX,"And into traps and trouble oft I stray,"
676,INDEX,"But when by chance the breaks are coming my way,"
677,INDEX,I do not claim I played the shots that way.

686,INDEX,Most contrary man I know.
687,INDEX,"Always sayin', ""That's not so."""
688,INDEX,
689,INDEX,"Nothing's ever said, but he"
690,INDEX,Steps right up to disagree--
691,INDEX,Quarrelsome as he can be.
692,INDEX,
693,INDEX,If you start in to recite
694,INDEX,"All the details of a fight,"
695,INDEX,He'll butt in to set you right.
696,INDEX,
697,INDEX,"Start a story that is true,"
698,INDEX,He'll begin correctin' you--
699,INDEX,"Make you out a liar, too!"
700,INDEX,
701,INDEX,"Mention time o' year or day,"
702,INDEX,"Makes no difference what you say,"
703,INDEX,Nothing happened just that way.
704,INDEX,
705,INDEX,"Bet you, when his soul takes flight,"
706,INDEX,"An' the angels talk at night,"
707,INDEX,He'll butt in to set 'em right.
708,INDEX,
709,INDEX,There where none should have complaints
710,INDEX,"He will be with ""no's"" and ""ain'ts"""
711,INDEX,Contradictin' all the saints.

716,INDEX,The Better Job
717,INDEX,
718,INDEX,
719,INDEX,If I were running a factory
720,INDEX,I'd stick up a sign for all to see;
721,INDEX,I'd print it large and I'd nail it high
722,INDEX,On every wall that the men walked by;
723,INDEX,And I'd have it carry this sentence clear:
724,INDEX,"""The 'better job' that you want is here!"""
725,INDEX,
726,INDEX,It's the common trait of the human race
727,INDEX,To pack up and roam from place to place;
728,INDEX,Men have done it for ages and do it now;
729,INDEX,Seeking to better themselves somehow
730,INDEX,They quit their posts and their tools they drop
731,INDEX,For a better job in another shop.
732,INDEX,
733,INDEX,"It may be I'm wrong, but I hold to this--"
734,INDEX,That something surely must be amiss
735,INDEX,When a man worth while must move away
736,INDEX,For the better job with the better pay;
737,INDEX,And something is false in our own renown
738,INDEX,When men can think of a better town.
739,INDEX,
740,INDEX,So if I were running a factory
741,INDEX,"I'd stick up this sign for all to see,"
742,INDEX,Which never an eye in the place could miss:
743,INDEX,"""There isn't a better town than this!"
744,INDEX,"You need not go wandering, far or near--"
745,INDEX,"The 'better job' that you want is here!"""

753,INDEX,"My religion's lovin' God, who made us, one and all,"
754,INDEX,"Who marks, no matter where it be, the humble sparrow's fall;"
755,INDEX,An' my religion's servin' Him the very best I can
756,INDEX,"By not despisin' anything He made, especially man!"
757,INDEX,"It's lovin' sky an' earth an' sun an' birds an' flowers an' trees,"
758,INDEX,But lovin' human beings more than any one of these.
759,INDEX,
760,INDEX,I ain't no hand at preachin' an' I can't expound the creeds;
761,INDEX,I fancy every fellow's faith must satisfy his needs
762,INDEX,Or he would hunt for something else. An' I can't tell the why
763,INDEX,An' wherefore of the doctrines deep--and what's more I don't try.
764,INDEX,"I reckon when this life is done and we can know His plan,"
765,INDEX,God won't be hard on anyone who's tried to be a man.
766,INDEX,
767,INDEX,My religion doesn't hinge on some one rite or word;
768,INDEX,I hold that any honest prayer a mortal makes is heard;
769,INDEX,"To love a church is well enough, but some get cold with pride"
770,INDEX,An' quite forget their fellowmen for whom the Saviour died;
771,INDEX,"I fancy he best worships God, when all is said an' done,"
772,INDEX,"Who tries to be, from day to day, a friend to everyone."
773,INDEX,
774,INDEX,"If God can mark the sparrow's fall, I don't believe He'll fail"
775,INDEX,To notice us an' how we act when doubts an' fears assail;
776,INDEX,"I think He'll hold what's in our hearts above what's in our creeds,"
777,INDEX,An' judge all our religion here by our recorded deeds;
778,INDEX,"An' since man is God's greatest work since life on earth began,"
779,INDEX,"He'll get to Heaven, I believe, who helps his fellowman."

784,INDEX,What I Call Living
785,INDEX,
786,INDEX,
787,INDEX,The miser thinks he's living when he's hoarding up his gold;
788,INDEX,The soldier calls it living when he's doing something bold;
789,INDEX,"The sailor thinks it living to be tossed upon the sea,"
790,INDEX,And upon this vital subject no two of us agree.
791,INDEX,"But I hold to the opinion, as I walk my way along,"
792,INDEX,That living's made of laughter and good-fellowship and song.
793,INDEX,
794,INDEX,"I wouldn't call it living always to be seeking gold,"
795,INDEX,To bank all the present gladness for the days when I'll be old.
796,INDEX,"I wouldn't call it living to spend all my strength for fame,"
797,INDEX,And forego the many pleasures which to-day are mine to claim.
798,INDEX,"I wouldn't for the splendor of the world set out to roam,"
799,INDEX,And forsake my laughing children and the peace I know at home.
800,INDEX,"Oh, the thing that I call living isn't gold or fame at all!"
801,INDEX,
802,INDEX,"It's good-fellowship and sunshine, and it's roses by the wall;"
803,INDEX,"It's evenings glad with music and a hearth fire that's ablaze,"
804,INDEX,And the joys which come to mortals in a thousand different ways.
805,INDEX,It is laughter and contentment and the struggle for a goal;
806,INDEX,It is everything that's needful in the shaping of a soul.

812,INDEX,If This Were All

815,INDEX,"If this were all of life we'll know,"
816,INDEX,If this brief space of breath
817,INDEX,"Were all there is to human toil,"
818,INDEX,"If death were really death,"
819,INDEX,And never should the soul arise
820,INDEX,"A finer world to see,"
821,INDEX,"How foolish would our struggles seem,"
822,INDEX,How grim the earth would be!
823,INDEX,
824,INDEX,"If living were the whole of life,"
825,INDEX,"To end in seventy years,"
826,INDEX,How pitiful its joys would seem!
827,INDEX,How idle all its tears!
828,INDEX,"There'd be no faith to keep us true,"
829,INDEX,"No hope to keep us strong,"
830,INDEX,And only fools would cherish dreams--
831,INDEX,No smile would last for long.
832,INDEX,
833,INDEX,How purposeless the strife would be
834,INDEX,"If there were nothing more,"
835,INDEX,"If there were not a plan to serve,"
836,INDEX,An end to struggle for!
837,INDEX,No reason for a mortal's birth
838,INDEX,Except to have him die--
839,INDEX,How silly all the goals would seem
840,INDEX,For which men bravely try.
841,INDEX,
842,INDEX,There must be something after death;
843,INDEX,Behind the toil of man
844,INDEX,There must exist a God divine
845,INDEX,Who's working out a plan;
846,INDEX,And this brief journey that we know
847,INDEX,As life must really be
848,INDEX,The gateway to a finer world
849,INDEX,That some day we shall see.

869,INDEX,Rest sweetly in His gracious care.
870,INDEX,

873,INDEX,"Though humble be the rafters here,"
874,INDEX,"Above them may the stars shine clear,"
875,INDEX,And in this home thou lovest well
876,INDEX,May excellence of spirit dwell.
877,INDEX,
878,INDEX,God bless you all this Christmas Day;

889,INDEX,
890,INDEX,
891,INDEX,He wears a long and solemn face
892,INDEX,And drives the children from his place;
893,INDEX,He doesn't like to hear them shout
894,INDEX,"Or race and run and romp about,"
895,INDEX,"And if they chance to climb his tree,"
896,INDEX,He is as ugly as can be.
897,INDEX,"If in his yard they drive a ball,"
898,INDEX,"Which near his pretty flowers should fall,"
899,INDEX,"He hides the leather sphere away,"
900,INDEX,Thus hoping to prevent their play.
901,INDEX,
902,INDEX,"The youngsters worry him a lot,"
903,INDEX,This sorry man who has forgot
904,INDEX,"That once upon a time, he too"
905,INDEX,The self-same mischief used to do.
906,INDEX,The boyhood he has left behind
907,INDEX,"Has strangely vanished from his mind,"
908,INDEX,And he is old and gray and cross
909,INDEX,For having suffered such a loss.
910,INDEX,He thinks he never had the joy
911,INDEX,That is the birthright of a boy.
912,INDEX,
913,INDEX,"He has forgotten how he ran,"
914,INDEX,"Or to a dog's tail tied a can,"
915,INDEX,"Broke window panes, and loved to swipe"
916,INDEX,"Some neighbor's apples, red and ripe--"
917,INDEX,"He thinks that always, day or night,"
918,INDEX,His conduct was exactly right.
919,INDEX,In boys to-day he cannot see
920,INDEX,"The youngster that he used to be,"
921,INDEX,"Forgotten is that by-gone day,"
922,INDEX,When he was mischievous as they.
923,INDEX,
924,INDEX,Poor man! I'm sorry for your lot.
925,INDEX,The best of life you have forgot.
926,INDEX,"Could you remember what you were,"
927,INDEX,"Unharnessed and untouched by spur,"
928,INDEX,These youngsters that you drive away
929,INDEX,Would be your comrades here to-day.
930,INDEX,Among them you could gayly walk

948,INDEX,"All unafraid of failure, to venture forth to fight,"
949,INDEX,Yet never for the victory's sake to turn away from right.
950,INDEX,
951,INDEX,"Ten thousand times the victor is he who fails to win,"
952,INDEX,Who could have worn the conqueror's crown by stooping low in sin;
953,INDEX,Ten thousand times the braver is he who turns away
954,INDEX,And scorns to crush a weaker man that he may rule the day.
955,INDEX,
956,INDEX,These are the peaks of valor: standing firm and standing true
957,INDEX,"To the best your father taught you and the best you've learned anew,"
958,INDEX,"Helpful to all who need you, winning what joys you can,"
959,INDEX,Writing in triumph to the end your record as a man.

964,INDEX,When the Minister Calls
965,INDEX,
966,INDEX,
967,INDEX,"My Paw says that it used to be,"
968,INDEX,"Whenever the minister came for tea,"
969,INDEX,'At they sat up straight in their chairs at night
970,INDEX,"An' put all their common things out o' sight,"
971,INDEX,"An' nobody cracked a joke or grinned,"
972,INDEX,"But they talked o' the way that people sinned,"
973,INDEX,An' the burnin' fires that would cook you sure
974,INDEX,"When you came to die, if you wasn't pure--"
975,INDEX,Such a gloomy affair it used to be
976,INDEX,Whenever the minister came for tea.
977,INDEX,
978,INDEX,But now when the minister comes to call
979,INDEX,"I get him out for a game of ball,"
980,INDEX,"And you'd never know if you'd see him bat,"
981,INDEX,"Without any coat or vest or hat,"
982,INDEX,"That he is a minister, no, siree!"
983,INDEX,He looks like a regular man to me.
984,INDEX,An' he knows just how to go down to the dirt
985,INDEX,For the grounders hot without gettin' hurt--
986,INDEX,"An' when they call us, both him an' me"
987,INDEX,Have to git washed up again for tea.
988,INDEX,
989,INDEX,Our minister says if you'll just play fair
990,INDEX,You'll be fit for heaven or anywhere;
991,INDEX,An' fun's all right if your hands are clean
992,INDEX,An' you never cheat an' you don't get mean.
993,INDEX,He says that he never has understood
994,INDEX,Why a feller can't play an' still be good.
995,INDEX,An' my Paw says that he's just the kind
996,INDEX,Of a minister that he likes to find--
997,INDEX,So I'm always tickled as I can be

1021,INDEX,Then for a time we claimed the joy
1022,INDEX,Of calling him our little boy.
1023,INDEX,
1024,INDEX,Brief was the reign of such a spell.
1025,INDEX,One morning sounded out a bell;
1026,INDEX,With tears I saw her brown eyes swim
1027,INDEX,And knew that it was calling him.
1028,INDEX,"Time, the harsh master of us all,"
1029,INDEX,Was bidding him to heed his call;
1030,INDEX,This shadow fell across life's pool--
1031,INDEX,Our boy was on his way to school.
1032,INDEX,
1033,INDEX,"Our little boy! And still we dreamed,"
1034,INDEX,For such a little boy he seemed!
1035,INDEX,"And yesterday, with eyes aglow"
1036,INDEX,Like one who has just come to know

1041,INDEX,
1042,INDEX,"Here was a change I'd not foreseen,"
1043,INDEX,Another step from what had been.

1790,INDEX,
1791,INDEX,A feller's hat can get away

2106,INDEX,Of the gift we'd buy for Mother.
2107,INDEX,

2114,INDEX,
2115,INDEX,We hadn't gone forth on our different ways
2116,INDEX,Nor coined our lives into yesterdays
2117,INDEX,"In the fires that smelt and smother,"
2118,INDEX,And we whispered and planned in our youthful glee
2119,INDEX,"Of that marvelous ""something"" which was to be"

2121,INDEX,
2122,INDEX,"It had to be all that our purse could give,"

2189,INDEX,The weary horse enjoys his ease
2190,INDEX,When all his work is done;
2191,INDEX,"The willing horse, day in and out,"
2192,INDEX,Can hear the merry children shout
2193,INDEX,And every time they are about
2194,INDEX,He shares in all their fun.
2195,INDEX,
2196,INDEX,I want no guards beside my door to pick and choose my friends for me;
2197,INDEX,I would not be shut off from men as is the fancy steed;
2198,INDEX,I do not care when I go by that no one turns his eyes to see
2199,INDEX,The dashing manner of my gait which marks my noble breed;
2200,INDEX,I am content to trudge the road
2201,INDEX,And willingly to draw my load--
2202,INDEX,Sometimes to know the spur and goad
2203,INDEX,When I begin to lag;
2204,INDEX,I'd rather feel the collar jerk

2206,INDEX,Than all the tasks of life to shirk
2207,INDEX,As does the stylish nag.

2209,INDEX,"So let me be the willing horse that now and then is overtasked,"
2210,INDEX,Let me be one the children love and freely dare to ride--
2211,INDEX,I'd rather be the gentle steed of which too much is sometimes asked
2212,INDEX,Than be the one that never knows the youngsters at his side.
2213,INDEX,"So drive me wheresoe'er you will,"
2214,INDEX,"On level road or up the hill,"
2215,INDEX,Pile on my back the burdens still
2216,INDEX,And run me out of breath--
2217,INDEX,"In love and friendship, day by day,"

2231,INDEX,"To play their games and to sing their songs,"
2232,INDEX,And they trample the lawn with their busy feet
2233,INDEX,"And they scatter their playthings about the street,"
2234,INDEX,"But though some folks order them off, I say,"
2235,INDEX,Let the house be mine where the children play.
2236,INDEX,
2237,INDEX,Armies gather about the door
2238,INDEX,And fill the air with their battle roar;
2239,INDEX,Cowboys swinging their lariat loops
2240,INDEX,"Dash round the house with the wildest whoops,"
2241,INDEX,And old folks have to look out when they
2242,INDEX,"Are holding an Indian tribe at bay,"
2243,INDEX,"For danger may find them on flying feet,"
2244,INDEX,Who pass by the house where the children meet.
2245,INDEX,
2246,INDEX,There are lawns too lovely to bear the weight
2247,INDEX,Of a troop of boys when they roller skate;
2248,INDEX,There are porches fine that must never know
2249,INDEX,"The stamping of footsteps that come and go,"
2250,INDEX,But on every street there's a favorite place
2251,INDEX,"Where the children gather to romp and race,"

2264,INDEX,
2265,INDEX,"Some buy their coins in a manly way, some buy them with honest toil;"

2268,INDEX,
2269,INDEX,The good man buys it from day to day by giving the best he can;
2270,INDEX,"He coins his strength for his children's needs and lives to a simple plan,"
2271,INDEX,And he keeps some time for the home he makes and some for his fellowman.
2272,INDEX,
2273,INDEX,"But some men buy it with women's tears, and some with a blasted name;"
2274,INDEX,And some will barter the joy of life for the fortune they hope to claim;

2276,INDEX,shame.

2332,INDEX,I looked at a party of shrieking girls
2333,INDEX,"Piled on a table that whirls and whirls,"
2334,INDEX,"And saw them thrown in a tangled heap,"
2335,INDEX,Sprawling and squirming and several deep.
2336,INDEX,"And unto the wife who was standing by,"
2337,INDEX,"""These are all angels to be,"" said I."
2338,INDEX,
2339,INDEX,I followed the ways of the merry throng
2340,INDEX,And heard the laughter and mirth and song.
2341,INDEX,Into a barrel which turned and swayed
2342,INDEX,"Men and women a journey made,"
2343,INDEX,And tumbling together they seemed to be
2344,INDEX,Like so many porpoises out at sea--
2345,INDEX,"Men and women who'd worked all day,"
2346,INDEX,Eagerly seeking a chance to play.
2347,INDEX,
2348,INDEX,"""What do you make of it all?"" she said."
2349,INDEX,"I answered: ""The dead are a long time dead,"

2351,INDEX,And each must weep when it comes his turn.

2353,INDEX,So here is laughter to end the day.

2375,INDEX,While others seem to have no way to tell the joys they see.
2376,INDEX,
2377,INDEX,Old Blake had sat in silence there and let each one of us declare
2378,INDEX,"Our notions of what's known as art, until he'd heard us through;"
2379,INDEX,"And then said he: ""It seems to me that any man, whoe'er he be,"
2380,INDEX,Becomes an artist by the good he daily tries to do.
2381,INDEX,
2382,INDEX,"""He need not write the books men read to be an artist. No, indeed!"
2383,INDEX,He need not work with paint and brush to show his love of art;
2384,INDEX,"Who does a kindly deed to-day and helps another on his way,"
2385,INDEX,Has painted beauty on a face and played the poet's part.
2386,INDEX,
2387,INDEX,"""Though some of us cannot express our inmost thoughts of loveliness,"
2388,INDEX,We prove we love the beautiful by how we act and live;
2389,INDEX,The poet singing of a tree no greater poet is than he
2390,INDEX,Who finds it in his heart some care unto a tree to give.
2391,INDEX,
2392,INDEX,"""Though he who works in marble stone the name of artist here may own,"

2401,INDEX,
2402,INDEX,
2403,INDEX,"A woman is queer, there's no doubt about that."
2404,INDEX,She hates to be thin and she hates to be fat;
2405,INDEX,"One minute it's laughter, the next it's a cry--"
2406,INDEX,"You can't understand her, however you try;"
2407,INDEX,But there's one thing about her which everyone knows--
2408,INDEX,A woman's not dressed till she powders her nose.
2409,INDEX,
2410,INDEX,You never can tell what a woman will say;
2411,INDEX,She's a law to herself every hour of the day.
2412,INDEX,"It keeps a man guessing to know what to do,"
2413,INDEX,And mostly he's wrong when his guessing is through;
2414,INDEX,"But this you can bet on, wherever she goes"
2415,INDEX,She'll find some occasion to powder her nose.
2416,INDEX,
2417,INDEX,I've studied the sex for a number of years;
2418,INDEX,I've watched her in laughter and seen her in tears;
2419,INDEX,"On her ways and her whims I have pondered a lot,"
2420,INDEX,To find what will please her and just what will not;
2421,INDEX,But all that I've learned from the start to the close
2422,INDEX,Is that sooner or later she'll powder her nose.
2423,INDEX,
2424,INDEX,"At church or a ball game, a dance or a show,"
2425,INDEX,There's one thing about her I know that I know--
2426,INDEX,"At weddings or funerals, dinners of taste,"
2427,INDEX,"You can bet that her hand will dive into her waist,"
2428,INDEX,"And every few minutes she'll strike up a pose,"

2438,INDEX,"Which you dare other boys to upset,"
2439,INDEX,"And stand up and fight for and struggle and smite for,"
2440,INDEX,Has caused you much shame and regret.
2441,INDEX,"When Time, life's adviser, has made you much wiser,"
2442,INDEX,You won't be so quick with the blow;
2443,INDEX,"You won't be so willing to fight for a shilling,"
2444,INDEX,And change a good friend to a foe.
2445,INDEX,
2446,INDEX,"You won't be a sticker for trifles, and bicker"
2447,INDEX,And quarrel for nothing at all;
2448,INDEX,"You'll grow to be kinder, more thoughtful and blinder"
2449,INDEX,To faults which are petty and small.
2450,INDEX,You won't take the trouble your two fists to double
2451,INDEX,When someone your pride may offend;
2452,INDEX,"When with rage now you bristle you'll smile or you'll whistle,"
2453,INDEX,And keep the good will of a friend.
2454,INDEX,
2455,INDEX,You'll learn when you're older that chip on your shoulder
2456,INDEX,"Which proudly you battle to guard,"
2457,INDEX,Has frequently shamed you and often defamed you
2458,INDEX,And left you a record that's marred!
2459,INDEX,"When you've grown calm and steady, you won't be so ready"
2460,INDEX,"To fight for a difference that's small,"

2475,INDEX,With eyes half-blind by tears o' grief
2476,INDEX,"While doubt is chokin' out belief,"
2477,INDEX,You'll find when all is understood
2478,INDEX,That what seemed bad was really good.
2479,INDEX,
2480,INDEX,Life can't be counted in a day.
2481,INDEX,The present rain that will not stop
2482,INDEX,Next autumn means a bumper crop.
2483,INDEX,We wonder why some things must be--
2484,INDEX,Care's purpose we can seldom see--
2485,INDEX,An' yet long afterwards we turn
2486,INDEX,"To view the past, an' then we learn"
2487,INDEX,That what once filled our minds with doubt
2488,INDEX,Was good for us as it worked out.
2489,INDEX,
2490,INDEX,I've never known an hour of care
2491,INDEX,But that I've later come to see
2492,INDEX,That it has brought some joy to me.
2493,INDEX,"Even the sorrows I have borne,"
2494,INDEX,Leavin' me lonely an' forlorn
2495,INDEX,"An' hurt an' bruised an' sick at heart,"
2496,INDEX,In life's great plan have had a part.
2497,INDEX,An' though I could not understand
2498,INDEX,"Why I should bow to Death's command,"
2499,INDEX,As time went on I came to know
2500,INDEX,That it was really better so.
2501,INDEX,

2506,INDEX,Which comes to-day to strike us low.
2507,INDEX,An' yet some day we turn an' find

2517,INDEX,
2518,INDEX,"After a man has been married awhile,"
2519,INDEX,"And his wife has grown used to his manner and style,"
2520,INDEX,When she knows from the twinkle that lights up his eye
2521,INDEX,"The thoughts he is thinking, the wherefore and why,"
2522,INDEX,"And just what he'll say, and just what he'll do,"
2523,INDEX,"And is sure that he'll make a bad break ere he's through,"
2524,INDEX,She has one little trick that she'll work when she's able--
2525,INDEX,She takes a sly kick at him under the table.
2526,INDEX,
2527,INDEX,"He may fancy the story he's telling is true,"
2528,INDEX,Or he's doing the thing which is proper to do;
2529,INDEX,"He may fancy he's holding his own with the rest,"
2530,INDEX,"The life of the party and right at his best,"
2531,INDEX,"When quickly he learns to his utter dismay,"
2532,INDEX,That he mustn't say what he's just started to say.
2533,INDEX,"He is stopped at the place where he hoped to begin,"
2534,INDEX,"By his wife, who has taken a kick at his shin."
2535,INDEX,
2536,INDEX,"If he picks the wrong fork for the salad, he knows"
2537,INDEX,That fact by the feel of his wife's slippered toes.
2538,INDEX,"If he's started a bit of untellable news,"
2539,INDEX,On the calf of his leg there is planted a bruise.
2540,INDEX,"Oh, I wonder sometimes what would happen to me"
2541,INDEX,If the wife were not seated just where she could be
2542,INDEX,"On guard every minute to watch every trick,"
2543,INDEX,And keep me in line all the time with her kick.

2551,INDEX,Seems only just a year ago that he was toddling round the place
2552,INDEX,In pretty little colored suits and with a pink and shining face.
2553,INDEX,"I used to hold him in my arms to watch when our canary sang,"
2554,INDEX,And now tonight he tells me that he's leader of his gang.
2555,INDEX,
2556,INDEX,"It seems but yesterday, I vow, that I with fear was almost dumb,"
2557,INDEX,Living those dreadful hours of care waiting the time for him to come;
2558,INDEX,And I can still recall the thrill of that first cry of his which rang
2559,INDEX,Within our walls. And now that babe tells me he's leader of his gang.
2560,INDEX,
2561,INDEX,Gone from our lives are all the joys which yesterday we used to own;
2562,INDEX,"The baby that we thought we had, out of the little home has flown,"
2563,INDEX,"And in his place another stands, whose garments in disorder hang,"
2564,INDEX,A lad who now with pride proclaims that he's the leader of his gang.
2565,INDEX,
2566,INDEX,And yet somehow I do not grieve for what it seems we may have lost;
2567,INDEX,"To have so strong a boy as this, most cheerfully I pay the cost."
2568,INDEX,"I find myself a sense of joy to comfort every little pang,"
2569,INDEX,And pray that they shall find in him a worthy leader of the gang.

2579,INDEX,"An' Pa says, ""Gosh! there's folks enough on earth to talk to, I should"
2580,INDEX,"think,"
2581,INDEX,"Without you pesterin' the folks whose souls have gone across the brink."""
2582,INDEX,"But Ma, she wants to find out things an' study on her own accord,"
2583,INDEX,An' so a month or two ago she went an' bought a ouija board.
2584,INDEX,
2585,INDEX,"It's just a shiny piece of wood, with letters printed here an' there,"
2586,INDEX,"An' has a little table which you put your fingers on with care,"
2587,INDEX,An' then you sit an' whisper low some question that you want to know.
2588,INDEX,"Then by an' by the spirit comes an' makes the little table go,"
2589,INDEX,"An' Ma, she starts to giggle then an' Pa just grumbles out, ""Oh, Lord!"
2590,INDEX,"I wish you hadn't bought this thing. We didn't need a ouija board."""
2591,INDEX,
2592,INDEX,"""You're movin' it!"" says Ma to Pa. ""I'm not!"" says Pa, ""I know it's you;"
2593,INDEX,"You're makin' it spell things to us that you know very well aren't true."""
2594,INDEX,"""That isn't so,"" says Ma to him, ""but I am certain from the way"
2595,INDEX,"The ouija moves that you're the one who's tellin' it just what to say."""
2596,INDEX,"""It's just 'lectricity,"" says Pa; ""like batteries all men are stored,"
2597,INDEX,"But anyhow I don't believe we ought to have a ouija board."""
2598,INDEX,
2599,INDEX,"One night Ma got it out, an' said, ""Now, Pa, I want you to be fair,"
2600,INDEX,Just keep right still an' let your hands rest lightly on the table there.
2601,INDEX,"Oh, Ouija, tell me, tell me true, are we to buy another car,"
2602,INDEX,"An' will we get it very soon?"" she asked. ""Oh, tell us from afar."""
2603,INDEX,"""Don't buy a car,"" the letters spelled, ""the price this year you can't"
2604,INDEX,"afford."""
2605,INDEX,"Then Ma got mad, an' since that time she's never used the ouija board."

2618,INDEX,"is sweet,"
2619,INDEX,Out where there's never a task to do or a goal to reach or a foe to meet.
2620,INDEX,
2621,INDEX,I must get out on the trails once more that wind through shadowy haunts and
2622,INDEX,"cool,"
2623,INDEX,"Away from the presence of wall and door, and see myself in a crystal pool;"
2624,INDEX,"I must get out with the silent things, where neither laughter nor hate is"

2627,INDEX,
2628,INDEX,"Oh, I've heard the call of the tall white pine, and heard the call of the"
2629,INDEX,running brook;

2631,INDEX,printed book.
2632,INDEX,"I want to get out of the din and strife, the clang and clamor of turning"

2647,INDEX,"From nine to ten, or two to three,"
2648,INDEX,"Or any hour that's fast and fleeting,"
2649,INDEX,There is a constant call for me
2650,INDEX,To go to some committee meeting.
2651,INDEX,
2652,INDEX,"The church has serious work to do,"
2653,INDEX,"The lodge and club has need of workers,"
2654,INDEX,They ask for just an hour or two--
2655,INDEX,Surely I will not join the shirkers?
2656,INDEX,Though I have duties of my own
2657,INDEX,"I should not drop before completing,"
2658,INDEX,There comes the call by telephone
2659,INDEX,To go to some committee meeting.
2660,INDEX,
2661,INDEX,No longer may I eat my lunch
2662,INDEX,In quietude and contemplation;
2663,INDEX,I must foregather with the bunch
2664,INDEX,To raise a fund to save the nation.
2665,INDEX,And I must talk of plans and schemes
2666,INDEX,"The while a scanty bite I'm eating,"
2667,INDEX,Until I vow to-day it seems
2668,INDEX,My life is one committee meeting.
2669,INDEX,
2670,INDEX,"When over me the night shall fall,"

2690,INDEX,"""I s'pose that we'd have died without that twenty dollar longeree."""
2691,INDEX,
2692,INDEX,"Then he starts in to write the checks for laundry  an' for light an' gas,"
2693,INDEX,An' never says a word 'bout them--because they're small he lets 'em pass.
2694,INDEX,"But when he starts to grunt an' groan, an' stops the while his pipe he"

2696,INDEX,We know that he is gettin' down to where Ma's hid the bigger bills.
2697,INDEX,"""Just what we had to have,"" says he, ""an' I'm supposed to pay the tolls;"

2699,INDEX,
2700,INDEX,"""If you should break a leg,"" says Pa, ""an couldn't get down town to shop,"
2701,INDEX,"I'll bet the dry goods men would see their business take an awful drop,"
2702,INDEX,"An' if they missed you for a week, they'd have to fire a dozen clerks!"
2703,INDEX,"Say, couldn't we have got along without this bunch of Billie Burkes?"""
2704,INDEX,"But Ma just sits an' grins at him, an' never has a word to say,"

2845,INDEX,Till you give the sign that you've got the range.

2847,INDEX,So why should I care if they get away?
2848,INDEX,
2849,INDEX,"Fact is, there are times that I'd ruther miss"

2854,INDEX,When I look at a bird that I've dared to kill.

3304,INDEX,And none of the comrades I've made could I spare;
3305,INDEX,"And should this be all, I could say ere I go,"
3306,INDEX,That life is worth while just such friendships to know.
3307,INDEX,
3308,INDEX,I have builded a home where we've loved and been glad;

3310,INDEX,"I have had their caresses through storm and through shine,"

3327,INDEX,
3328,INDEX,"The dog sprawled out before me knows that huntin' days are here,"

3330,INDEX,"An' the children playin' checkers till it's time to go to bed,"

3379,INDEX,"The load is off his shoulders now,"

3383,INDEX,
3384,INDEX,He's done the very thing he thought

3393,INDEX,
3394,INDEX,"To-day he has the right to smile,"

3421,INDEX,
3422,INDEX,Here's something of mine that shall ever stand

3424,INDEX,"Here is the work of my brain and hand,"
3425,INDEX,Towering above the town.
3426,INDEX,"And the idlers gay in their smug content,"

3477,INDEX,"I've seen them in the busy town,"
3478,INDEX,And seen them under country sky;
3479,INDEX,"I've talked with toilers in the ranks,"
3480,INDEX,"And walked with men whose hands were white,"
3481,INDEX,"And learned, when closed were stores and banks,"
3482,INDEX,We're nearly all alike at night.
3483,INDEX,
3484,INDEX,Just find the wise professor when
3485,INDEX,"He isn't lost in ancient lore,"
3486,INDEX,"And he, like many other men,"
3487,INDEX,Romps with his children on the floor.
3488,INDEX,He puts his gravity aside

3503,INDEX,"His utmost. Brothers are we all,"
3504,INDEX,"When we have run the work-day through,"

3506,INDEX,Rich men and poor delight in play

3520,INDEX,Lit up by many a friendly face.
3521,INDEX,You pass 'em by a dozen times
3522,INDEX,"An' never think o' them in rhymes,"
3523,INDEX,Or fit for poet's singin'. Yet
3524,INDEX,They're all the things you can't forget;
3525,INDEX,An' they're the things you'll miss some day
3526,INDEX,If ever you should go away.
3527,INDEX,
3528,INDEX,The people here ain't much to see--
3529,INDEX,"Jes' common folks like you an' me,"
3530,INDEX,Doin' the ordinary tasks
3531,INDEX,Which life of everybody asks:
3532,INDEX,"Old Dr. Green, still farin' 'round"
3533,INDEX,"To where his patients can be found,"
3534,INDEX,"An' Parson Hill, serene o' face,"
3535,INDEX,"Carryin' God's message every place,"
3536,INDEX,"An' Jim, who keeps the grocery store--"
3537,INDEX,Yet they are folks you'd hunger for.
3538,INDEX,
3539,INDEX,They seem so plain when close to view--
3540,INDEX,"Bill Barker, an' his brother too,"
3541,INDEX,"The Jacksons, men of higher rank"
3542,INDEX,"Because they chance to run the bank,"
3543,INDEX,"Yet friends to every one round here,"
3544,INDEX,"Quiet an' kindly an' sincere,"
3545,INDEX,"Not much to sing about or praise,"
3546,INDEX,Livin' their lives in modest ways--
3547,INDEX,Yet in your memory they'd stay
3548,INDEX,If ever you should go away.
3549,INDEX,
3550,INDEX,These are things an' these the men
3551,INDEX,Some day you'll long to see again.
3552,INDEX,Now it's so near you scarcely see
3553,INDEX,"The beauty o' that big elm tree,"
3554,INDEX,But some day later on you will
3555,INDEX,"An' wonder if it's standin' still,"
3556,INDEX,An' if the birds return to sing
3557,INDEX,An' make their nests there every spring.

3574,INDEX,If there were no such a thing as a flag in the sky as a symbol of
3575,INDEX,"comradeship here,"

3592,INDEX,in common we share;

3604,INDEX,
3605,INDEX,

3608,INDEX,"I'd do things I was ashamed of when the fit of rage had passed,"
3609,INDEX,"An' wish I hadn't done 'em, an' regret 'em to the last;"
3610,INDEX,"But I've learned from sad experience how useless is regret,"
3611,INDEX,For the mean things done in anger are the things you can't forget.
3612,INDEX,
3613,INDEX,'Tain't no use to kiss the youngster once your hand has made him cry;
3614,INDEX,You'll recall the time you struck him till the very day you die;

3616,INDEX,"But you'll keep the hateful picture of your sorrow an' your shame,"
3617,INDEX,"An' it's bound to rise to taunt you, though you long have squared the debt,"
3618,INDEX,For the things you've done in meanness are the things you can't forget.
3619,INDEX,
3620,INDEX,"Lord, I sometimes sit an' shudder when some scene comes back to me,"
3621,INDEX,"Which shows me big an' brutal in some act o' tyranny,"

3624,INDEX,"So I'd be a whole sight happier now my sun begins to set,"
3625,INDEX,If it wasn't for the meanness which I've done an' can't forget.
3626,INDEX,
3627,INDEX,"Now I think I've learned my lesson an' I'm treadin' gentler ways,"
3628,INDEX,An' I try to build my mornings into happy yesterdays;
3629,INDEX,I don't let my temper spoil 'em in the way I used to do
3630,INDEX,An' let some splash of anger smear the record when it's through;

3648,INDEX,They never see the glorious deed the failure tried to do.
3649,INDEX,
3650,INDEX,Some men there are who never leave the city's well-worn streets;
3651,INDEX,They never know the dangers grim the bold adventurer meets;

3654,INDEX,
3655,INDEX,"Oh, better 'tis to fail and fall in sorrow and despair,"
3656,INDEX,Than stand where all is safe and sure and never face a care;

3738,INDEX,"An' hold a little party dance, I'm happiest of all."

3745,INDEX,"Beats any high-toned music where the bright lights shine an' glare,"
3746,INDEX,"An' the racket they are makin' stirs my pulses more and more,"
3747,INDEX,So I whisper in my gladness: that's what home's intended for.
3748,INDEX,
3749,INDEX,"Then I smile an' say to Mother, let 'em move the chairs about,"

3771,INDEX,"Oh, it's little we care"
3772,INDEX,"That the wind may blow,"

3774,INDEX,With the drifted snow;
3775,INDEX,We'll face the storm
3776,INDEX,"With the break o' day,"
3777,INDEX,But to-night we'll dream
3778,INDEX,An' we'll sing an' play.
3779,INDEX,
3780,INDEX,We'll sit by the fire
3781,INDEX,"Where it's snug an' warm,"

3788,INDEX,
3789,INDEX,That's all that counts
3790,INDEX,When the day is done:
3791,INDEX,The smiles of love

3810,INDEX,
3811,INDEX,"There's something 'round the fireplace that no club can imitate,"

3941,INDEX,"Watching for someone to come again,"
3942,INDEX,And I am the someone they wait to see--
3943,INDEX,These are the joys life gives to me.
3944,INDEX,
3945,INDEX,What has my neighbor excelling this:
3946,INDEX,A good wife's love and a baby's kiss?
3947,INDEX,What if his chimneys tower higher?
3948,INDEX,Peace is found at our humble fire.
3949,INDEX,What if his silver and gold are more?
3950,INDEX,Rest is ours when the day is o'er.
3951,INDEX,
3952,INDEX,"Strive for fortune and slave for fame,"
3953,INDEX,You find that joy always stays the same:
3954,INDEX,Rich man and poor man dream and pray
3955,INDEX,"For a home where laughter shall ever stay,"
3956,INDEX,And the wheels go round and men spend their might
3957,INDEX,For the few glad hours they may claim at night.
3958,INDEX,
3959,INDEX,"Home, where the kettle shall gaily sing,"
3960,INDEX,Is all that matters with serf or king;
3961,INDEX,Gold and silver and laurelled fame
3962,INDEX,Are only sweet when the hearth's aflame
3963,INDEX,"With a cheerful fire, and the loved ones there"
3964,INDEX,Are unafraid of the wolves of care.
3965,INDEX,
3966,INDEX,So let me come home at night to rest
3967,INDEX,With those who know I have done my best;
3968,INDEX,"Let the wife rejoice and my children smile,"
3969,INDEX,"And I'll know by their love that I am worthwhile,"

3981,INDEX,And nobody wakes at morning but hopes ere the day is o'er
3982,INDEX,To have come to a richer pleasure than ever he's known before.
3983,INDEX,
3984,INDEX,For man is a dreamer ever. He glimpses the hills afar
3985,INDEX,And plans for the joys off yonder where all his to-morrows are;
3986,INDEX,"When trials and cares beset him, in the distance he still can see"
3987,INDEX,A hint of a future splendid and the glory that is to be.
3988,INDEX,
3989,INDEX,There's never a man among us but cherishes dreams of rest;

3993,INDEX,
3994,INDEX,"Back of the sound of the hammer, and back of the hissing steam,"
3995,INDEX,And back of the hand at the throttle is ever a lofty dream;

4004,INDEX,
4005,INDEX,Success is being friendly when another needs a friend;
4006,INDEX,"It's in the cheery words you speak, and in the coins you lend;"
4007,INDEX,Success is not alone in skill and deeds of daring great;
4008,INDEX,It's in the roses that you plant beside your garden gate.
4009,INDEX,
4010,INDEX,Success is in the way you walk the paths of life each day;
4011,INDEX,It's in the little things you do and in the things you say;
4012,INDEX,Success is in the glad hello you give your fellow man;
4013,INDEX,It's in the laughter of your home and all the joys you plan.
4014,INDEX,
4015,INDEX,Success is not in getting rich or rising high to fame;
4016,INDEX,It's not alone in winning goals which all men hope to claim;
4017,INDEX,"It's in the man you are each day, through happiness or care;"
4018,INDEX,It's in the cheery words you speak and in the smile you wear.
4019,INDEX,
4020,INDEX,Success is being big of heart and clean and broad of mind;
4021,INDEX,"It's being faithful to your friends, and to the stranger, kind;"
4022,INDEX,"It's in the children whom you love, and all they learn from you--"
4023,INDEX,Success depends on character and everything you do.

4030,INDEX,
4031,INDEX,I'd like to steal a day and be
4032,INDEX,"All alone with little me,"

4034,INDEX,Everywhere in search of fun;
4035,INDEX,Little me of long ago
4036,INDEX,Who was glad and didn't know
4037,INDEX,Life is freighted down with care
4038,INDEX,For the backs of men to bear;
4039,INDEX,Little me who thought a smile
4040,INDEX,Ought to linger all the while--
4041,INDEX,On his Mother's pretty face
4042,INDEX,And a tear should never trace
4043,INDEX,"Lines of sorrow, hurt or care"
4044,INDEX,On those cheeks so wondrous fair.
4045,INDEX,
4046,INDEX,I should like once more to be
4047,INDEX,All alone with youthful me;
4048,INDEX,Youthful me who saw the hills
4049,INDEX,Where the sun its splendor spills
4050,INDEX,And was certain that in time
4051,INDEX,To the topmost height he'd climb;
4052,INDEX,"Youthful me, serene of soul,"
4053,INDEX,Who beheld a shining goal.
4054,INDEX,And imagined he could gain
4055,INDEX,"Glory without grief or pain,"
4056,INDEX,"Confident and quick with life,"
4057,INDEX,"Madly eager for the strife,"
4058,INDEX,Knowing not that bitter care
4059,INDEX,Waited for his coming there.
4060,INDEX,
4061,INDEX,I should like to sit alone
4062,INDEX,"With the me now older grown,"
4063,INDEX,Like to lead the little me
4064,INDEX,And the youth that used to be
4065,INDEX,Once again along the ways
4066,INDEX,Of our glorious yesterdays.
4067,INDEX,We could chuckle soft and low
4068,INDEX,"At the things we didn't know,"
4069,INDEX,And could laugh to think how bold
4070,INDEX,"We had been in days of old,"
4071,INDEX,And how blind we were to care
4072,INDEX,"With its heartache and despair,"
4073,INDEX,We could smile away the tears

4091,INDEX,"Away from his bench,"
4092,INDEX,"His hammer and wrench,"
4093,INDEX,And the grind of need
4094,INDEX,"And the sordid deed,"
4095,INDEX,And this you'll find
4096,INDEX,As he bares his mind:
4097,INDEX,In the things which count when this life is through
4098,INDEX,He's as tender and big and as good as you.
4099,INDEX,
4100,INDEX,"Be fair with him,"
4101,INDEX,And share with him
4102,INDEX,"An hour of time in a restful place,"
4103,INDEX,"Brother to brother and face to face,"
4104,INDEX,And he'll whisper low
4105,INDEX,"Of the long ago,"
4106,INDEX,Of a loved one dead
4107,INDEX,And the tears he shed;
4108,INDEX,And you'll come to see
4109,INDEX,"That in suffering he,"
4110,INDEX,"With you, is hurt by the self-same rod"
4111,INDEX,And turns for help to the self-same God.
4112,INDEX,
4113,INDEX,"You hope as he,"
4114,INDEX,"You dream of splendors, and so does he;"
4115,INDEX,His children must be as you'd have yours be;
4116,INDEX,He shares your love
4117,INDEX,"For the Flag above,"
4118,INDEX,He laughs and sings
4119,INDEX,For the self-same things;
4120,INDEX,When he's understood
4121,INDEX,"He is mostly good,"
4122,INDEX,"Thoughtful of others and kind and true,"
4123,INDEX,"Brave, devoted--and much like you."

4139,INDEX,"And drop the working tools of life,"
4140,INDEX,"Somewhere, somehow, we'll come to find"
4141,INDEX,Just what our Maker had in mind.
4142,INDEX,
4143,INDEX,Perhaps through clearer eyes than these
4144,INDEX,"We'll read life's hidden mysteries,"
4145,INDEX,And learn the reason for our tears--
4146,INDEX,"Why sometimes came unhappy years,"
4147,INDEX,And why our dearest joys were brief
4148,INDEX,And bound so closely unto grief.
4149,INDEX,
4150,INDEX,"There is so much beyond our scope,"
4151,INDEX,"As blindly on through life we grope,"
4152,INDEX,"So much we cannot understand,"
4153,INDEX,"However wisely we have planned,"
4154,INDEX,That all who walk this earth about
4155,INDEX,Are constantly beset by doubt.
4156,INDEX,
4157,INDEX,No one of us can truly say
4158,INDEX,"Why loved ones must be called away,"
4159,INDEX,"Why hearts are hurt, or e'en explain"
4160,INDEX,Why some must suffer years of pain;
4161,INDEX,Yet some day all of us shall know
4162,INDEX,The reason why these things are so.
4163,INDEX,
4164,INDEX,"I reckon in the years to come,"
4165,INDEX,"When these poor lips of clay are dumb,"
4166,INDEX,"And these poor hands have ceased to toil,"

4180,INDEX,"Then he'd chuckle low an' say,"
4181,INDEX,"""Come along, I'm on my way,"

4184,INDEX,
4185,INDEX,"When his merry call they'd hear,"
4186,INDEX,"All the children, far an' near,"
4187,INDEX,Would come flyin' from the gardens
4188,INDEX,Like the chickens after wheat;
4189,INDEX,When we'd shake our heads an' say:
4190,INDEX,"""No, you mustn't go to-day!"""

4218,INDEX,"When I was but a little lad of six and seven and eight,"
4219,INDEX,"One joy I knew that has been lost in customs up-to-date,"
4220,INDEX,"Then Saturday was baking day and Mother used to make,"
4221,INDEX,"The while I stood about and watched, the Sunday pies and cake;"
4222,INDEX,"And I was there to have fulfilled a small boy's fondest wish,"
4223,INDEX,The glorious privilege of youth--to scrape the frosting dish!
4224,INDEX,
4225,INDEX,On Saturdays I never left to wander far away--
4226,INDEX,I hovered near the kitchen door on Mother's baking day;
4227,INDEX,"The fragrant smell of cooking seemed to hold me in its grip,"
4228,INDEX,And naught cared I for other sports while there were sweets to sip;
4229,INDEX,I little cared that all my chums had sought the brook to fish;
4230,INDEX,I chose to wait that moment glad when I could scrape the dish.
4231,INDEX,
4232,INDEX,Full many a slice of apple I have lifted from a pie
4233,INDEX,"Before the upper crust went on, escaping Mother's eye;"
4234,INDEX,Full many a time my fingers small in artfulness have strayed
4235,INDEX,Into some sweet temptation rare which Mother's hands had made;
4236,INDEX,"But eager-eyed and watery-mouthed, I craved the greater boon,"
4237,INDEX,When Mother let me clean the dish and lick the frosting spoon.
4238,INDEX,
4239,INDEX,"The baking days of old are gone, our children cannot know"
4240,INDEX,The glorious joys that childhood owned and loved so long ago.
4241,INDEX,New customs change the lives of all and in their heartless way
4242,INDEX,They've robbed us of the glad event once known as baking day.
4243,INDEX,"The stores provide our every need, yet many a time I wish"
4244,INDEX,Our kids could know that bygone thrill and scrape the frosting dish.

4252,INDEX,"They spoke it bravely, grimly, in their darkest hours of doubt;"
4253,INDEX,They spoke it when their hope was low and when their strength gave out;
4254,INDEX,"We heard it from the dying in those troubled days now gone,"
4255,INDEX,"And they breathed it as their slogan for the living: ""Carry on!"""
4256,INDEX,
4257,INDEX,"Now the days of strife are over, and the skies are fair again,"
4258,INDEX,But those two brave words of courage on our lips should still remain;
4259,INDEX,"In the trials which beset us and the cares we look upon,"
4260,INDEX,"To our dead we should be faithful--we have still to ""carry on!"""

4272,INDEX,There are a thousand ways to cheat and a thousand ways to sin;

4278,INDEX,

4281,INDEX,"Some rise to fame by the force of skill, grow great by the might of power,"
4282,INDEX,"Then wreck the temple they toiled to build, in a single, shameful hour."
4283,INDEX,
4284,INDEX,The follies outnumber the virtues good; sin lures in a thousand ways;
4285,INDEX,But slow is the growth of man's character and patience must mark his days;

4303,INDEX,"He knew He'd have to shape us so that when our hearts were gay,"
4304,INDEX,We could let our neighbors know it in a quick and easy way.
4305,INDEX,
4306,INDEX,"So He touched the lips of Adam and He touched the lips of Eve,"
4307,INDEX,"And He said: ""Let these be solemn when your sorrows make you grieve,"
4308,INDEX,"But when all is well in Eden and your life seems worth the while,"

4325,INDEX,The True Man
4326,INDEX,
4327,INDEX,
4328,INDEX,This is the sort of a man was he:
4329,INDEX,True when it hurt him a lot to be;
4330,INDEX,Tight in a corner an' knowin' a lie
4331,INDEX,"Would have helped him out, but he wouldn't buy"
4332,INDEX,His freedom there in so cheap a way--
4333,INDEX,He told the truth though he had to pay.
4334,INDEX,
4335,INDEX,"Honest! Not in the easy sense,"
4336,INDEX,When he needn't worry about expense--
4337,INDEX,We'll all play square when it doesn't count
4338,INDEX,And the sum at stake's not a large amount--
4339,INDEX,"But he was square when the times were bad,"
4340,INDEX,An' keepin' his word took all he had.
4341,INDEX,
4342,INDEX,"Honor is something we all profess,"
4343,INDEX,"But most of us cheat--some more, some less--"
4344,INDEX,An' the real test isn't the way we do
4345,INDEX,When there isn't a pinch in either shoe;
4346,INDEX,It's whether we're true to our best or not
4347,INDEX,When the right thing's certain to hurt a lot.
4348,INDEX,
4349,INDEX,That is the sort of a man was he:
4350,INDEX,Straight when it hurt him a lot to be;
4351,INDEX,"Times when a lie would have paid him well,"
4352,INDEX,"No matter the cost, the truth he'd tell;"
4353,INDEX,An' he'd rather go down to a drab defeat
4354,INDEX,Than save himself if he had to cheat.

4360,INDEX,
4361,INDEX,
4362,INDEX,"Last night Pa said to Ma: ""My dear, it's gettin' on to fall,"
4363,INDEX,It's time I did a little job I do not like at all.
4364,INDEX,I wisht 'at I was rich enough to hire a man to do
4365,INDEX,"The dirty work around this house an' clean up when he's through,"
4366,INDEX,"But since I'm not, I'm truly glad that I am strong an' stout,"
4367,INDEX,"An' ain't ashamed to go myself an' clean the furnace out."""
4368,INDEX,
4369,INDEX,Then after supper Pa put on his overalls an' said
4370,INDEX,He'd work down in the cellar till 'twas time to go to bed.
4371,INDEX,"He started in to rattle an' to bang an' poke an' stir,"
4372,INDEX,An' the dust began a-climbin' up through every register
4373,INDEX,"Till Ma said: ""Goodness gracious; go an' shut those things up tight"
4374,INDEX,"Or we'll all be suffocated an' the house will be a sight."""
4375,INDEX,
4376,INDEX,"Then he carted out the ashes in a basket an' a pail,"
4377,INDEX,An' from cellar door to alley he just left an ashy trail.
4378,INDEX,"Then he pulled apart the chimney, an' 'twas full of something black,"
4379,INDEX,An' he skinned most all his knuckles when he tried to put it back.
4380,INDEX,"We could hear him talkin' awful, an' Ma looked at us an' said:"
4381,INDEX,"""I think it would be better if you children went to bed."""
4382,INDEX,
4383,INDEX,"When he came up from the cellar there were ashes in his hair,"
4384,INDEX,There were ashes in his eyebrows--but he didn't seem to care--
4385,INDEX,"There were ashes in his mustache, there were ashes in his eyes,"
4386,INDEX,An' we never would have known him if he'd took us by surprise.
4387,INDEX,"""Well, I got it clean,"" he sputtered, and Ma said:  ""I guess that's true;"
4388,INDEX,"Once the dirt was in the furnace, but now most of it's on you."""

4393,INDEX,Trouble Brings Friends
4394,INDEX,
4395,INDEX,
4396,INDEX,It's seldom trouble comes alone. I've noticed this: When things go wrong
4397,INDEX,"An' trouble comes a-visitin', it always brings a friend along;"
4398,INDEX,"Sometimes it's one you've known before, and then perhaps it's someone new"
4399,INDEX,Who stretches out a helping hand an' stops to see what he can do.
4400,INDEX,
4401,INDEX,"If never trials came to us, if grief an' sorrow passed us by,"
4402,INDEX,"If every day the sun came out an' clouds were never in the sky,"
4403,INDEX,"We'd still have neighbors, I suppose, each one pursuin' selfish ends,"
4404,INDEX,But only neighbors they would be--we'd never know them as our friends.
4405,INDEX,
4406,INDEX,"Out of the troubles I have had have come my richest friendships here,"
4407,INDEX,"Kind hands have helped to bear my care, kind words have fallen on my ear;"
4408,INDEX,An' so I say when trouble comes I know before the storm shall end
4409,INDEX,That I shall find my bit of care has also brought to me a friend.
