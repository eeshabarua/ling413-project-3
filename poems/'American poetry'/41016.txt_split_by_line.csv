52,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"The inestimable value of literature in supplying healthful recreation,"
53,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"in opening the mind to larger views of life, and in creating ideals that"
54,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"shall mold the spiritual nature, is conceded now by every one who has"
55,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,intelligently considered the problems of education. But the basis upon
56,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,which literature shall be selected and arranged is still a matter of
57,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,discussion.
58,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
59,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Chronology, race-correspondence, correlation, and ethical training"
60,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,should all be recognized incidentally; but the main purpose of the
61,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,teacher of literature is to send children on into life with a genuine
62,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"love for good reading. To accomplish this, three things should be true"
63,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"of the reading offered: first, it should be _literature_; second, it"
64,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"should be literature of some scope, not merely some small phase of"
65,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"literature, such as the fables, or the poetry of one of the less eminent"
66,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"poets; and third, it should appeal to children's natural interests."
67,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Children's interests, varied as they seem, center in the marvelous and"
68,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"the preternatural; in the natural world; and in human life, especially"
69,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,child life and the romantic and heroic aspects of mature life. In the
70,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"selections made for each grade, we have recognized these different"
71,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,interests.
72,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
73,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,To grade poetry perfectly for different ages is an impossibility; much
74,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,of the greatest verse is for all ages--that is one reason why it _is_
75,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,great. A child of five will lisp the numbers of Horatius with delight;
76,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"and Scott's _Lullaby of an Infant Chief_, with its romantic color and"
77,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"its exquisite human tenderness, is dear to childhood, to manhood, and to"
78,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,old age. But the Land of Song is a great undiscovered country to the
79,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,little child; by some road or other he must find his way into it; and
80,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,these volumes simply attempt to point out a path through which he may be
81,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,led into its happy fields.
82,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
83,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Our earnest thanks are due to the following publishers for permission to
84,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"use copyrighted poems: to Houghton, Mifflin & Co. for poems by"
85,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Longfellow, Whittier, Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Aldrich, Bayard Taylor,"
86,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"James T. Fields, Ph[oe]be Cary, Lucy Larcom, Celia Thaxter, and Sarah"
87,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Orne Jewett; to D. Appleton & Co. for a large number of Bryant's poems:
88,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"to Charles Scribner's Sons for two poems by Stevenson, from"
89,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"_Underwoods_, and _A Child's Garden of Verses_; to J. B. Lippincott &"
90,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Co. for two poems by Thomas Buchanan Read; and to Henry T. Coates & Co.
91,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,for a poem by Charles Fenno Hoffman.
92,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
93,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"The present volume is intended for the seventh, eighth, and ninth school"
94,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"years, or higher grammar grades. It is the third of three books prepared"
95,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,for use in the grades below the high school. As no collection of this
96,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"size can supply as much poetry as may be used to advantage, and as many"
97,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"desirable poems by American writers have necessarily been omitted, we"
98,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,have noted at the end of this volume lists of poems which it would be
99,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"well to add to the material given here, that our children may realize"
100,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,the scope and beauty of the poetry of their own land.

1129,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"The quality of mercy is not strained,"
1130,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
1131,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
1132,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
1133,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
1134,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,The thronèd monarch better than his crown:
1135,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"His scepter shows the force of temporal power,"
1136,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"The attribute to awe and majesty,"
1137,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
1138,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,But mercy is above this sceptered sway;
1139,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"It is enthronèd in the heart of kings,"
1140,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,It is an attribute to God himself;
1141,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,And earthly power doth then show likest God's
1142,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,"
1143,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,"
1144,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,"That, in the course of justice, none of us"
1145,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
1146,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
1147,THE QUALITY OF MERCY.,The deeds of mercy.

1160,A SELECTION.,A SELECTION.
1161,A SELECTION.,
1162,A SELECTION.,
1163,A SELECTION.,"But the Consul's brow was sad,"
1164,A SELECTION.,"And the Consul's speech was low,"
1165,A SELECTION.,"And darkly looked he at the wall,"
1166,A SELECTION.,And darkly at the foe.
1167,A SELECTION.,"""Their van will be upon us"
1168,A SELECTION.,Before the bridge goes down;
1169,A SELECTION.,"And if they once may win the bridge,"
1170,A SELECTION.,"What hope to save the town?"""
1171,A SELECTION.,
1172,A SELECTION.,"Then out spake brave Horatius,"
1173,A SELECTION.,The Captain of the Gate:
1174,A SELECTION.,"""To every man upon this earth"
1175,A SELECTION.,Death cometh soon or late.
1176,A SELECTION.,And how can man die better
1177,A SELECTION.,"Than facing fearful odds,"
1178,A SELECTION.,"For the ashes of his fathers,"
1179,A SELECTION.,And the temples of his Gods;
1180,A SELECTION.,
1181,A SELECTION.,"""And for the tender mother"

1184,A SELECTION.,"His baby at her breast,"
1185,A SELECTION.,And for the holy maidens

1187,A SELECTION.,To save them from false Sextus

1189,A SELECTION.,
1190,A SELECTION.,"""Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,"
1191,A SELECTION.,With all the speed ye may;
1192,A SELECTION.,"I, with two more to help me,"
1193,A SELECTION.,Will hold the foe in play.
1194,A SELECTION.,In yon straight path a thousand
1195,A SELECTION.,May well be stopped by three.
1196,A SELECTION.,"Now who will stand on either hand,"
1197,A SELECTION.,"And keep the bridge with me?"""
1198,A SELECTION.,
1199,A SELECTION.,Then out spake Spurius Lartius;
1200,A SELECTION.,A Ramnian proud was he:
1201,A SELECTION.,"""Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,"
1202,A SELECTION.,"And keep the bridge with thee."""
1203,A SELECTION.,And out spake strong Herminius;
1204,A SELECTION.,Of Titian blood was he:
1205,A SELECTION.,"""I will abide on thy left side,"
1206,A SELECTION.,"And keep the bridge with thee."""
1207,A SELECTION.,
1208,A SELECTION.,"""Horatius,"" quoth the Consul,"
1209,A SELECTION.,"""As thou sayest, so let it be."""
1210,A SELECTION.,And straight against that great array
1211,A SELECTION.,Forth went the dauntless Three.
1212,A SELECTION.,For Romans in Rome's quarrel
1213,A SELECTION.,"Spared neither land nor gold,"
1214,A SELECTION.,"Nor son, nor wife, nor limb, nor life,"
1215,A SELECTION.,In the brave days of old.
1216,A SELECTION.,
1217,A SELECTION.,Then none was for a party;
1218,A SELECTION.,Then all were for the state;
1219,A SELECTION.,"Then the great man helped the poor,"
1220,A SELECTION.,And the poor man loved the great:
1221,A SELECTION.,Then lands were fairly portioned;
1222,A SELECTION.,Then spoils were fairly sold:
1223,A SELECTION.,The Romans were like brothers
1224,A SELECTION.,In the brave days of old.
1225,A SELECTION.,
1226,A SELECTION.,Now Roman is to Roman
1227,A SELECTION.,"More hateful than a foe,"
1228,A SELECTION.,"And the Tribunes beard the high,"
1229,A SELECTION.,"And the Fathers grind the low,"
1230,A SELECTION.,"As we wax hot in faction,"
1231,A SELECTION.,In battle we wax cold:
1232,A SELECTION.,Wherefore men fight not as they fought
1233,A SELECTION.,In the brave days of old.
1234,A SELECTION.,
1235,A SELECTION.,Now while the Three were tightening
1236,A SELECTION.,"Their harness on their backs,"
1237,A SELECTION.,The Consul was the foremost man
1238,A SELECTION.,To take in hand an ax:
1239,A SELECTION.,And Fathers mixed with Commons
1240,A SELECTION.,"Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,"

1242,A SELECTION.,And loosed the props below.
1243,A SELECTION.,
1244,A SELECTION.,"Meanwhile the Tuscan army,"
1245,A SELECTION.,"Right glorious to behold,"
1246,A SELECTION.,"Came flashing back the noonday light,"
1247,A SELECTION.,"Rank behind rank, like surges bright"
1248,A SELECTION.,Of a broad sea of gold.
1249,A SELECTION.,Four hundred trumpets sounded
1250,A SELECTION.,"A peal of warlike glee,"
1251,A SELECTION.,"As that great host, with measured tread,"
1252,A SELECTION.,"And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,"
1253,A SELECTION.,"Rolled slowly towards the bridge's head,"
1254,A SELECTION.,Where stood the dauntless Three.
1255,A SELECTION.,
1256,A SELECTION.,"The Three stood calm and silent,"
1257,A SELECTION.,"And looked upon the foes,"
1258,A SELECTION.,And a great shout of laughter
1259,A SELECTION.,From all the vanguard rose;
1260,A SELECTION.,And forth three chiefs came spurring
1261,A SELECTION.,Before that deep array;
1262,A SELECTION.,"To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,"
1263,A SELECTION.,"And lifted high their shields, and flew"
1264,A SELECTION.,To win the narrow way;
1265,A SELECTION.,
1266,A SELECTION.,"Aunus from green Tifernum,"
1267,A SELECTION.,Lord of the Hill of Vines;
1268,A SELECTION.,"And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves"
1269,A SELECTION.,Sicken in Ilva's mines;
1270,A SELECTION.,"And Picus, long to Clusium"
1271,A SELECTION.,"Vassal in peace and war,"
1272,A SELECTION.,Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
1273,A SELECTION.,"From that gray crag where, girt with towers,"
1274,A SELECTION.,The fortress of Nequinum towers
1275,A SELECTION.,O'er the pale waves of Nar.
1276,A SELECTION.,
1277,A SELECTION.,Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
1278,A SELECTION.,Into the stream beneath:
1279,A SELECTION.,"Herminius struck at Seius,"
1280,A SELECTION.,And clove him to the teeth:
1281,A SELECTION.,At Picus Brave Horatius
1282,A SELECTION.,Darted one fiery thrust;
1283,A SELECTION.,And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms
1284,A SELECTION.,Clashed in the bloody dust.
1285,A SELECTION.,
1286,A SELECTION.,Then Ocnus of Falerii
1287,A SELECTION.,Rushed on the Roman Three;
1288,A SELECTION.,"And Lausulus of Urgo,"
1289,A SELECTION.,The rover of the sea;
1290,A SELECTION.,"And Aruns of Volsinium,"
1291,A SELECTION.,"Who slew the great wild boar,"
1292,A SELECTION.,The great wild boar that had his den
1293,A SELECTION.,"Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,"
1294,A SELECTION.,"And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,"
1295,A SELECTION.,Along Albinia's shore.
1296,A SELECTION.,
1297,A SELECTION.,Herminius smote down Aruns:
1298,A SELECTION.,Lartius laid Ocnus low:
1299,A SELECTION.,Right to the heart of Lausulus
1300,A SELECTION.,Horatius sent a blow.
1301,A SELECTION.,"""Lie there,"" he cried, ""fell pirate!"
1302,A SELECTION.,"No more, aghast and pale,"
1303,A SELECTION.,From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
1304,A SELECTION.,The track of thy destroying bark.
1305,A SELECTION.,No more Campania's hinds shall fly
1306,A SELECTION.,To woods and caverns when they spy
1307,A SELECTION.,"Thy thrice accursèd sail."""
1308,A SELECTION.,
1309,A SELECTION.,But now no sound of laughter
1310,A SELECTION.,"Was heard among the foes,"
1311,A SELECTION.,A wild and wrathful clamor
1312,A SELECTION.,From all the vanguard rose.
1313,A SELECTION.,Six spears' lengths from the entrance
1314,A SELECTION.,"Halted that deep array,"
1315,A SELECTION.,And for a space no man came forth
1316,A SELECTION.,To win the narrow way.
1317,A SELECTION.,
1318,A SELECTION.,"But hark! the cry is ""Astur"";"
1319,A SELECTION.,And lo! the ranks divide;
1320,A SELECTION.,And the great Lord of Luna
1321,A SELECTION.,Comes with his stately stride.
1322,A SELECTION.,Upon his ample shoulders
1323,A SELECTION.,"Clangs loud the fourfold shield,"
1324,A SELECTION.,And in his hand he shakes the brand
1325,A SELECTION.,Which none but he can wield.
1326,A SELECTION.,
1327,A SELECTION.,He smiled on those bold Romans
1328,A SELECTION.,A smile serene and high;
1329,A SELECTION.,"He eyed the flinching Tuscans,"
1330,A SELECTION.,And scorn was in his eye.
1331,A SELECTION.,"Quoth he, ""The she-wolf's litter"
1332,A SELECTION.,Stands savagely at bay:
1333,A SELECTION.,"But will ye dare to follow,"
1334,A SELECTION.,"If Astur clears the way?"""
1335,A SELECTION.,
1336,A SELECTION.,"Then, whirling up his broadsword"
1337,A SELECTION.,"With both hands to the height,"
1338,A SELECTION.,"He rushed against Horatius,"
1339,A SELECTION.,And smote with all his might.
1340,A SELECTION.,With shield and blade Horatius
1341,A SELECTION.,Right deftly turned the blow.
1342,A SELECTION.,"The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;"
1343,A SELECTION.,"It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh;"
1344,A SELECTION.,The Tuscans raised a joyful cry
1345,A SELECTION.,To see the red blood flow.
1346,A SELECTION.,
1347,A SELECTION.,"He reeled, and on Herminius"
1348,A SELECTION.,He leaned one breathing-space;
1349,A SELECTION.,"Then, like a wild cat mad with wounds,"
1350,A SELECTION.,Sprang right at Astur's face.
1351,A SELECTION.,"Through teeth, and skull, and helmet"
1352,A SELECTION.,"So fierce a thrust he sped,"
1353,A SELECTION.,The good sword stood a hand-breadth out
1354,A SELECTION.,Behind the Tuscan's head.
1355,A SELECTION.,
1356,A SELECTION.,And the great Lord of Luna
1357,A SELECTION.,"Fell at that deadly stroke,"
1358,A SELECTION.,As falls on Mount Alvernus
1359,A SELECTION.,A thunder-smitten oak.
1360,A SELECTION.,Far o'er the crashing forest
1361,A SELECTION.,The giant arms lie spread;
1362,A SELECTION.,"And the pale augurs, muttering low,"
1363,A SELECTION.,Gaze on the blasted head.
1364,A SELECTION.,
1365,A SELECTION.,On Astur's throat Horatius
1366,A SELECTION.,"Right firmly pressed his heel,"
1367,A SELECTION.,"And thrice and four times tugged amain,"
1368,A SELECTION.,Ere he wrenched out the steel.
1369,A SELECTION.,"""And see,"" he cried, ""the welcome,"
1370,A SELECTION.,"Fair guests, that waits you here!"
1371,A SELECTION.,What noble Lucumo comes next
1372,A SELECTION.,"To taste our Roman cheer?"""
1373,A SELECTION.,
1374,A SELECTION.,But at his haughty challenge
1375,A SELECTION.,"A sullen murmur ran,"
1376,A SELECTION.,"Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread,"
1377,A SELECTION.,Along that glittering van.
1378,A SELECTION.,"There lacked not men of prowess,"
1379,A SELECTION.,Nor men of lordly race;
1380,A SELECTION.,For all Etruria's noblest
1381,A SELECTION.,Were round the fatal place.
1382,A SELECTION.,
1383,A SELECTION.,But all Etruria's noblest
1384,A SELECTION.,Felt their hearts sink to see
1385,A SELECTION.,"On the earth the bloody corpses,"
1386,A SELECTION.,In the path the dauntless Three.
1387,A SELECTION.,And from the ghastly entrance
1388,A SELECTION.,"Where those bold Romans stood,"
1389,A SELECTION.,"All shrank, like boys who unaware,"
1390,A SELECTION.,"Ranging the woods to start a hare,"
1391,A SELECTION.,Come to the mouth of the dark lair
1392,A SELECTION.,"Where, growling low, a fierce old bear"
1393,A SELECTION.,Lies amidst bones and blood.
1394,A SELECTION.,
1395,A SELECTION.,Was none who would be foremost
1396,A SELECTION.,To lead such dire attack:
1397,A SELECTION.,"But those behind cried, ""Forward!"""
1398,A SELECTION.,"And those before cried, ""Back!"""
1399,A SELECTION.,And backward now and forward
1400,A SELECTION.,Wavers the deep array;
1401,A SELECTION.,"And on the tossing sea of steel,"
1402,A SELECTION.,To and fro the standards reel;
1403,A SELECTION.,And the victorious trumpet-peal
1404,A SELECTION.,Dies fitfully away.
1405,A SELECTION.,
1406,A SELECTION.,Yet one man for one moment
1407,A SELECTION.,Stood out before the crowd;
1408,A SELECTION.,"Well known was he to all the Three,"
1409,A SELECTION.,And they gave him greeting loud.
1410,A SELECTION.,"""Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!"
1411,A SELECTION.,Now welcome to thy home!
1412,A SELECTION.,"Why dost thou stay, and turn away,"
1413,A SELECTION.,"Here lies the road to Rome."""
1414,A SELECTION.,
1415,A SELECTION.,Thrice looked he at the city;
1416,A SELECTION.,Thrice looked he at the dead;
1417,A SELECTION.,"And thrice came on in fury,"
1418,A SELECTION.,And thrice turned back in dread;
1419,A SELECTION.,"And, white with fear and hatred,"
1420,A SELECTION.,Scowled at the narrow way
1421,A SELECTION.,"Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,"
1422,A SELECTION.,The bravest Tuscans lay.
1423,A SELECTION.,
1424,A SELECTION.,But meanwhile ax and lever
1425,A SELECTION.,Have manfully been plied;
1426,A SELECTION.,And now the bridge hangs tottering
1427,A SELECTION.,Above the boiling tide.
1428,A SELECTION.,"""Come back, come back, Horatius!"""
1429,A SELECTION.,"Loud cried the Fathers all,"
1430,A SELECTION.,"""Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!"
1431,A SELECTION.,"Back, ere the ruin fall!"""
1432,A SELECTION.,
1433,A SELECTION.,Back darted Spurius Lartius;
1434,A SELECTION.,Herminius darted back:
1435,A SELECTION.,"And, as they passed, beneath their feet"
1436,A SELECTION.,They felt the timbers crack.
1437,A SELECTION.,"But when they turned their faces,"
1438,A SELECTION.,And on the farther shore
1439,A SELECTION.,"Saw brave Horatius stand alone,"
1440,A SELECTION.,They would have crossed once more.
1441,A SELECTION.,
1442,A SELECTION.,But with a crash like thunder
1443,A SELECTION.,"Fell every loosened beam,"
1444,A SELECTION.,"And, like a dam, the mighty wreck"
1445,A SELECTION.,Lay right athwart the stream;
1446,A SELECTION.,And a long shout of triumph
1447,A SELECTION.,"Rose from the walls of Rome,"
1448,A SELECTION.,As to the highest turret-tops
1449,A SELECTION.,Was splashed the yellow foam.
1450,A SELECTION.,
1451,A SELECTION.,And like a horse unbroken
1452,A SELECTION.,"When first he feels the rein,"
1453,A SELECTION.,"The furious river struggled hard,"
1454,A SELECTION.,"And tossed his tawny mane,"
1455,A SELECTION.,"And burst the curb, and bounded,"
1456,A SELECTION.,Rejoicing to be free;
1457,A SELECTION.,"And whirling down, in fierce career,"
1458,A SELECTION.,"Battlement, and plank, and pier,"
1459,A SELECTION.,Rushed headlong to the sea.
1460,A SELECTION.,
1461,A SELECTION.,"Alone stood brave Horatius,"
1462,A SELECTION.,But constant still in mind;
1463,A SELECTION.,"Thrice thirty thousand foes before,"
1464,A SELECTION.,And the broad flood behind.
1465,A SELECTION.,"""Down with him!"" cried false Sextus,"
1466,A SELECTION.,With a smile on his pale face.
1467,A SELECTION.,"""Now yield thee,"" cried Lars Porsena,"
1468,A SELECTION.,"""Now yield thee to our grace."""
1469,A SELECTION.,
1470,A SELECTION.,"Round turned he, as not deigning"
1471,A SELECTION.,Those craven ranks to see;
1472,A SELECTION.,"Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,"
1473,A SELECTION.,To Sextus naught spake he;
1474,A SELECTION.,But he saw on Palatinus
1475,A SELECTION.,The white porch of his home;
1476,A SELECTION.,And he spake to the noble river
1477,A SELECTION.,That rolls by the towers of Rome.
1478,A SELECTION.,
1479,A SELECTION.,"""Oh, Tiber! father Tiber!"
1480,A SELECTION.,"To whom the Romans pray,"
1481,A SELECTION.,"A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,"
1482,A SELECTION.,"Take thou in charge this day."""
1483,A SELECTION.,"So he spake, and speaking sheathed"
1484,A SELECTION.,"The good sword by his side,"
1485,A SELECTION.,"And with his harness on his back,"
1486,A SELECTION.,Plunged headlong in the tide.
1487,A SELECTION.,
1488,A SELECTION.,No sound of joy or sorrow
1489,A SELECTION.,Was heard from either bank;
1490,A SELECTION.,"But friends and foes, in dumb surprise,"
1491,A SELECTION.,"With parted lips and straining eyes,"
1492,A SELECTION.,Stood gazing where he sank;
1493,A SELECTION.,And when above the surges
1494,A SELECTION.,"They saw his crest appear,"
1495,A SELECTION.,"All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,"
1496,A SELECTION.,And even the ranks of Tuscany
1497,A SELECTION.,Could scarce forbear to cheer.
1498,A SELECTION.,
1499,A SELECTION.,"But fiercely ran the current,"
1500,A SELECTION.,Swollen high by months of rain:
1501,A SELECTION.,And fast his blood was flowing
1502,A SELECTION.,"And he was sore in pain,"
1503,A SELECTION.,"And heavy with his armor,"
1504,A SELECTION.,And spent with changing blows:
1505,A SELECTION.,"And oft they thought him sinking,"
1506,A SELECTION.,But still again he rose.
1507,A SELECTION.,
1508,A SELECTION.,"Never, I ween, did swimmer,"
1509,A SELECTION.,"In such an evil case,"
1510,A SELECTION.,Struggle through such a raging flood
1511,A SELECTION.,Safe to the landing-place:
1512,A SELECTION.,But his limbs were borne up bravely
1513,A SELECTION.,By the brave heart within;
1514,A SELECTION.,And our good father Tiber
1515,A SELECTION.,Bore bravely up his chin.
1516,A SELECTION.,
1517,A SELECTION.,"""Curse on him!"" quoth false Sextus;"
1518,A SELECTION.,"""Will not the villain drown?"
1519,A SELECTION.,"But for this stay, ere close of day"
1520,A SELECTION.,"We should have sacked the town!"""
1521,A SELECTION.,"""Heaven help him!"" quoth Lars Porsena,"
1522,A SELECTION.,"""And bring him safe to shore;"
1523,A SELECTION.,For such a gallant feat of arms
1524,A SELECTION.,"Was never seen before."""
1525,A SELECTION.,
1526,A SELECTION.,And now he feels the bottom;
1527,A SELECTION.,Now on dry earth he stands;
1528,A SELECTION.,Now round him throng the Fathers
1529,A SELECTION.,To press his gory hands;
1530,A SELECTION.,"And now, with shouts and clapping,"
1531,A SELECTION.,"And noise of weeping loud,"
1532,A SELECTION.,"He enters through the River-Gate,"
1533,A SELECTION.,Borne by the joyous crowd.
1534,A SELECTION.,
1535,A SELECTION.,"They gave him of the corn-land,"
1536,A SELECTION.,"That was of public right,"
1537,A SELECTION.,As much as two strong oxen
1538,A SELECTION.,Could plow from morn till night;
1539,A SELECTION.,"And they made a molten image,"
1540,A SELECTION.,"And set it up on high,"
1541,A SELECTION.,And there it stands unto this day
1542,A SELECTION.,To witness if I lie.
1543,A SELECTION.,
1544,A SELECTION.,"It stands in the Comitium,"
1545,A SELECTION.,Plain for all folk to see;
1546,A SELECTION.,"Horatius in his harness,"
1547,A SELECTION.,Halting upon one knee:
1548,A SELECTION.,"And underneath is written,"
1549,A SELECTION.,"In letters all of gold,"
1550,A SELECTION.,"How valiantly he kept the bridge,"
1551,A SELECTION.,In the brave days of old.
1552,A SELECTION.,
1553,A SELECTION.,And still his name sounds stirring
1554,A SELECTION.,"Unto the men of Rome,"
1555,A SELECTION.,As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
1556,A SELECTION.,To charge the Volscian home;
1557,A SELECTION.,And wives still pray to Juno
1558,A SELECTION.,For boys with hearts as bold
1559,A SELECTION.,As his who kept the bridge so well
1560,A SELECTION.,In the brave days of old.
1561,A SELECTION.,
1562,A SELECTION.,"And in the nights of winter,"
1563,A SELECTION.,"When the cold north winds blow,"
1564,A SELECTION.,And the long howling of the wolves
1565,A SELECTION.,Is heard amidst the snow;
1566,A SELECTION.,When round the lonely cottage
1567,A SELECTION.,"Roars loud the tempest's din,"
1568,A SELECTION.,And the good logs of Algidus
1569,A SELECTION.,Roar louder yet within;
1570,A SELECTION.,
1571,A SELECTION.,"When the oldest cask is opened,"
1572,A SELECTION.,And the largest lamp is lit;
1573,A SELECTION.,"When the chestnuts glow in the embers,"
1574,A SELECTION.,And the kid turns on the spit;
1575,A SELECTION.,When young and old in circle
1576,A SELECTION.,Around the firebrands close;
1577,A SELECTION.,"When the girls are weaving baskets,"
1578,A SELECTION.,And the lads are shaping bows;
1579,A SELECTION.,
1580,A SELECTION.,"When the goodman mends his armor,"
1581,A SELECTION.,And trims his helmet's plume;
1582,A SELECTION.,When the goodwife's shuttle merrily

2386,TWILIGHT CALM.,O Pleasant eventide!
2387,TWILIGHT CALM.,Clouds on the western side
2388,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Grow gray and grayer, hiding the warm sun:"
2389,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The bees and birds, their happy labors done,"
2390,TWILIGHT CALM.,Seek their close nests and bide.
2391,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2392,TWILIGHT CALM.,Screened in the leafy wood
2393,TWILIGHT CALM.,The stockdoves sit and brood:
2394,TWILIGHT CALM.,The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough
2395,TWILIGHT CALM.,But lazily; pauses; and settles now
2396,TWILIGHT CALM.,Where once he stored his food.
2397,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2398,TWILIGHT CALM.,"One by one the flowers close,"
2399,TWILIGHT CALM.,Lily and dewy rose
2400,TWILIGHT CALM.,Shutting their tender petals from the moon:
2401,TWILIGHT CALM.,The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon
2402,TWILIGHT CALM.,Are still the noisy crows.
2403,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2404,TWILIGHT CALM.,The dormouse squats and eats
2405,TWILIGHT CALM.,Choice little dainty bits
2406,TWILIGHT CALM.,Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime;
2407,TWILIGHT CALM.,Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time
2408,TWILIGHT CALM.,And listens where he sits.
2409,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2410,TWILIGHT CALM.,From far the lowings come
2411,TWILIGHT CALM.,Of cattle driven home:
2412,TWILIGHT CALM.,From farther still the wind brings fitfully
2413,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The vast continual murmur of the sea,"
2414,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Now loud, now almost dumb."
2415,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2416,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The gnats whirl in the air,"
2417,TWILIGHT CALM.,The evening gnats; and there
2418,TWILIGHT CALM.,The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail
2419,TWILIGHT CALM.,For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail
2420,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Comes forth, clammy and bare."
2421,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2422,TWILIGHT CALM.,Hark! that's the nightingale.
2423,TWILIGHT CALM.,Telling the selfsame tale
2424,TWILIGHT CALM.,Her song told when this ancient earth was young:
2425,TWILIGHT CALM.,So echoes answered when her song was sung
2426,TWILIGHT CALM.,In the first wooded vale.
2427,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2428,TWILIGHT CALM.,"We call it love and pain,"
2429,TWILIGHT CALM.,The passion of her strain;
2430,TWILIGHT CALM.,And yet we little understand or know:
2431,TWILIGHT CALM.,Why should it not be rather joy that so
2432,TWILIGHT CALM.,Throbs in each throbbing vein?
2433,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2434,TWILIGHT CALM.,In separate herds the deer
2435,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Lie; here the bucks, and here"
2436,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn:"
2437,TWILIGHT CALM.,Through all the hours of night until the dawn
2438,TWILIGHT CALM.,"They sleep, forgetting fear."
2439,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2440,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The hare sleeps where it lies,"
2441,TWILIGHT CALM.,With wary half-closed eyes:
2442,TWILIGHT CALM.,"The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:"
2443,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Only the fox is out, some heedless duck"
2444,TWILIGHT CALM.,Or chicken to surprise.
2445,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2446,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Remote, each single star"
2447,TWILIGHT CALM.,"Comes out, till there they are"
2448,TWILIGHT CALM.,All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp!
2449,TWILIGHT CALM.,While close at hand the glowworm lights her lamp
2450,TWILIGHT CALM.,Or twinkles from afar.
2451,TWILIGHT CALM.,
2452,TWILIGHT CALM.,But evening now is done
2453,TWILIGHT CALM.,As much as if the sun
2454,TWILIGHT CALM.,Day-giving had arisen in the east:
2455,TWILIGHT CALM.,"For night has come; and the great calm has ceased,"
2456,TWILIGHT CALM.,The quiet sands have run.

4053,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4054,THE WHITE SHIP.,Of ruthless strokes full many a one
4055,THE WHITE SHIP.,He had struck to crown himself and his son;
4056,THE WHITE SHIP.,And his elder brother's eyes were gone.
4057,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4058,THE WHITE SHIP.,"And when to the chase his court would crowd,"

4062,THE WHITE SHIP.,But all the chiefs of the English land
4063,THE WHITE SHIP.,Had knelt and kissed the Prince's hand.
4064,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4065,THE WHITE SHIP.,And next with his son he sailed to France
4066,THE WHITE SHIP.,To claim the Norman allegiance:
4067,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4068,THE WHITE SHIP.,And every baron in Normandy
4069,THE WHITE SHIP.,Had taken the oath of fealty.
4070,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4071,THE WHITE SHIP.,"'Twas sworn and sealed, and the day had come"

4154,THE WHITE SHIP.,The knights and the ladies raised a song.
4155,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4156,THE WHITE SHIP.,"A song,--nay, a shriek that rent the sky,"
4157,THE WHITE SHIP.,That leaped o'er the deep!--the grievous cry
4158,THE WHITE SHIP.,Of three hundred living that now must die.
4159,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4160,THE WHITE SHIP.,An instant shriek that sprang to the shock
4161,THE WHITE SHIP.,As the ship's keel felt the sunken rock.
4162,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4163,THE WHITE SHIP.,'Tis said that afar--a shrill strange sigh--
4164,THE WHITE SHIP.,The King's ships heard it and knew not why.
4165,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4166,THE WHITE SHIP.,Pale Fitz-Stephen stood by the helm
4167,THE WHITE SHIP.,'Mid all those folk that the waves must whelm.
4168,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4169,THE WHITE SHIP.,"A great King's heir for the waves to whelm,"
4170,THE WHITE SHIP.,And the helpless pilot pale at the helm!
4171,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4172,THE WHITE SHIP.,"The ship was eager and sucked athirst,"
4173,THE WHITE SHIP.,By the stealthy stab of the sharp reef pierced:
4174,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4175,THE WHITE SHIP.,"And like the moil round a sinking cup,"
4176,THE WHITE SHIP.,The waters against her crowded up.
4177,THE WHITE SHIP.,
4178,THE WHITE SHIP.,"A moment the pilot's senses spin,--"
4179,THE WHITE SHIP.,"The next he snatched the Prince 'mid the din,"
4180,THE WHITE SHIP.,"Cut the boat loose, and the youth leaped in."

4182,THE WHITE SHIP.,"A few friends leaped with him, standing near."

4188,THE WHITE SHIP.,"Out of the churn of the choking ship,"
4189,THE WHITE SHIP.,"Which the gulf grapples and the waves strip,"

5285,DORA.,
5286,DORA.,
5287,DORA.,With farmer Allan at the farm abode
5288,DORA.,"William and Dora. William was his son,"
5289,DORA.,"And she his niece. He often looked at them,"
5290,DORA.,"And often thought, ""I'll make them man and wife."""
5291,DORA.,"Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,"
5292,DORA.,"And yearned towards William; but the youth, because"
5293,DORA.,"He had been always with her in the house,"
5294,DORA.,Thought not of Dora.
5295,DORA.,Then there came a day
5296,DORA.,"When Allan called his son, and said, ""My son,"
5297,DORA.,"I married late, but I would wish to see"
5298,DORA.,My grandchild on my knees before I die;
5299,DORA.,And I have set my heart upon a match.
5300,DORA.,Now therefore look to Dora: she is well
5301,DORA.,To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
5302,DORA.,She is my brother's daughter; he and I
5303,DORA.,"Had once hard words, and parted, and he died"
5304,DORA.,In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
5305,DORA.,His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;
5306,DORA.,"For I have wished this marriage, night and day,"
5307,DORA.,"For many years."" But William answered short:"
5308,DORA.,"""I cannot marry Dora; by my life,"
5309,DORA.,"I will not marry Dora."" Then the old man"
5310,DORA.,"Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:"
5311,DORA.,"""You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!"
5312,DORA.,"But in my time a father's word was law,"
5313,DORA.,And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;
5314,DORA.,"Consider, William: take a month to think,"
5315,DORA.,And let me have an answer to my wish;
5316,DORA.,"Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,"
5317,DORA.,"And never more darken my doors again."""
5318,DORA.,"But William answered madly; bit his lips,"
5319,DORA.,And broke away. The more he looked at her
5320,DORA.,The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
5321,DORA.,But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
5322,DORA.,The month was out he left his father's house
5323,DORA.,And hired himself to work within the fields;
5324,DORA.,"And half in love, half spite, he wooed and wed"
5325,DORA.,"A laborer's daughter, Mary Morrison."
5326,DORA.,"Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan called"
5327,DORA.,"His niece and said, ""My girl, I love you well;"
5328,DORA.,"But if you speak with him that was my son,"
5329,DORA.,"Or change a word with her he calls his wife,"
5330,DORA.,"My home is none of yours. My will is law."""
5331,DORA.,"And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,"
5332,DORA.,"""It cannot be; my uncle's mind will change!"""
5333,DORA.,"And days went on, and there was born a boy"
5334,DORA.,To William; then distresses came on him;
5335,DORA.,"And day by day he passed his father's gate,"
5336,DORA.,"Heart-broken, and his father helped him not."
5337,DORA.,"But Dora stored what little she could save,"
5338,DORA.,"And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know"
5339,DORA.,Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
5340,DORA.,"On William, and in harvest time he died."
5341,DORA.,Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
5342,DORA.,"And looked with tears upon her boy, and thought"
5343,DORA.,Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:
5344,DORA.,"""I have obeyed my uncle until now,"
5345,DORA.,"And I have sinned, for it was all thro' me"
5346,DORA.,This evil came on William at the first.
5347,DORA.,"But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,"
5348,DORA.,"And for your sake, the woman that he chose,"
5349,DORA.,"And for this orphan, I am come to you;"
5350,DORA.,You know there has not been for these five years
5351,DORA.,"So full a harvest; let me take the boy,"
5352,DORA.,And I will set him in my uncle's eye
5353,DORA.,Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
5354,DORA.,"Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,"
5355,DORA.,"And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."""
5356,DORA.,"And Dora took the child, and went her way"
5357,DORA.,"Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound"
5358,DORA.,"That was unsown, where many poppies grew."
5359,DORA.,Far off the farmer came into the field
5360,DORA.,And spied her not; for none of all his men
5361,DORA.,Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
5362,DORA.,"And Dora would have risen and gone to him,"
5363,DORA.,"But her heart failed her; and the reapers reaped,"
5364,DORA.,"And the sun fell, and all the land was dark."
5365,DORA.,"But when the morrow came, she rose and took"
5366,DORA.,"The child once more, and sat upon the mound;"
5367,DORA.,And made a little wreath of all the flowers
5368,DORA.,"That grew about, and tied it round his hat"
5369,DORA.,To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.
5370,DORA.,"Then, when the farmer passed into the field,"
5371,DORA.,"He spied her, and he left his men at work,"
5372,DORA.,"And came and said: ""Where were you yesterday?"
5373,DORA.,"Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"""
5374,DORA.,"So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,"
5375,DORA.,"And answered softly, ""This is William's child!"""
5376,DORA.,"""And did I not,"" said Allan, ""did I not"
5377,DORA.,"Forbid you, Dora?"" Dora said again:"
5378,DORA.,"""Do with me as you will, but take the child"
5379,DORA.,"And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"""
5380,DORA.,"And Allan said, ""I see it is a trick"
5381,DORA.,Got up betwixt you and the woman there.
5382,DORA.,"I must be taught my duty, and by you!"
5383,DORA.,"You knew my word was law, and yet you dared"
5384,DORA.,To slight it. Well--for I will take the boy;
5385,DORA.,"But go you hence, and never see me more."""
5386,DORA.,"So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud"
5387,DORA.,And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
5388,DORA.,"At Dora's feet. She bowed upon her hands,"
5389,DORA.,"And the boy's cry came to her from the field,"
5390,DORA.,"More and more distant. She bowed down her head,"
5391,DORA.,"Remembering the day when first she came,"
5392,DORA.,And all the things that had been. She bowed down
5393,DORA.,"And wept in secret; and the reapers reaped,"
5394,DORA.,"And the sun fell, and all the land was dark."
5395,DORA.,"Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood"
5396,DORA.,Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
5397,DORA.,Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
5398,DORA.,"To God, that helped her in her widowhood."
5399,DORA.,"And Dora said, ""My uncle took the boy;"
5400,DORA.,"But, Mary, let me live and work with you:"
5401,DORA.,"He says that he will never see me more."""
5402,DORA.,"Then answered Mary, ""This shall never be,"
5403,DORA.,That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself;
5404,DORA.,"And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,"
5405,DORA.,"For he will teach him hardness, and to slight"
5406,DORA.,"His mother; therefore thou and I will go,"
5407,DORA.,"And I will have my boy, and bring him home;"
5408,DORA.,And I will beg of him to take thee back.
5409,DORA.,"But if he will not take thee back again,"
5410,DORA.,"Then thou and I will live within one house,"
5411,DORA.,"And work for William's child, until he grows"
5412,DORA.,"Of age to help us."""
5413,DORA.,So the women kissed
5414,DORA.,"Each other, and set out, and reached the farm."
5415,DORA.,"The door was off the latch; they peeped, and saw"
5416,DORA.,"The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,"
5417,DORA.,"Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,"
5418,DORA.,"And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,"
5419,DORA.,Like one that loved him; and the lad stretched out
5420,DORA.,"And babbled for the golden seal, that hung"
5421,DORA.,"From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire."
5422,DORA.,Then they came in; but when the boy beheld
5423,DORA.,"His mother, he cried out to come to her;"
5424,DORA.,"And Allan set him down, and Mary said:"
5425,DORA.,"""O Father!--if you let me call you so--"
5426,DORA.,"I never came a begging for myself,"
5427,DORA.,"Or William, or this child; but now I come"
5428,DORA.,For Dora; take her back; she loves you well.
5429,DORA.,"O Sir, when William died, he died at peace"
5430,DORA.,"With all men; for I asked him, and he said,"
5431,DORA.,He could not ever rue his marrying me--
5432,DORA.,"I had been a patient wife; but, Sir, he said"
5433,DORA.,That he was wrong to cross his father thus;
5434,DORA.,"'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know"
5435,DORA.,The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turned
5436,DORA.,His face and passed--unhappy that I am!
5437,DORA.,"But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you"
5438,DORA.,"Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight"
5439,DORA.,"His father's memory; and take Dora back,"
5440,DORA.,"And let all this be as it was before."""
5441,DORA.,"So Mary said, and Dora hid her face"
5442,DORA.,By Mary. There was silence in the room;
5443,DORA.,And all at once the old man burst in sobs:--
5444,DORA.,"""I have been to blame--to blame. I have killed my son."
5445,DORA.,I have killed him--but I loved him--my dear son.
5446,DORA.,May God forgive me!--I have been to blame.
5447,DORA.,"Kiss me, my children."""
5448,DORA.,Then they clung about
5449,DORA.,"The old man's neck, and kissed him many times."
5450,DORA.,And all the man was broken with remorse;
5451,DORA.,And all his love came back a hundredfold;
5452,DORA.,"And for three hours he sobbed o'er William's child,"
5453,DORA.,Thinking of William.
5454,DORA.,So those four abode
5455,DORA.,Within one house together; and as years
5456,DORA.,"Went forward, Mary took another mate;"
5457,DORA.,But Dora lived unmarried till her death.

7159,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"If it were so, it were a grievous fault,"
7160,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.
7161,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--"

7165,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"He was my friend, faithful and just to me:"
7166,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,But Brutus says he was ambitious;

7168,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"He hath brought many captives home to Rome,"
7169,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
7170,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?
7171,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:"
7172,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

7176,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"I thrice presented him a kingly crown,"
7177,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
7178,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

7180,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,"

7201,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,But here's a parchment with the seal of Cæsar;

7245,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,"
7246,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,That day he overcame the Nervii:
7247,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:"
7248,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,See what a rent the envious Casca made:
7249,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed;
7250,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"And as he plucked his cursèd steel away,"
7251,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"Mark how the blood of Cæsar followed it,"

7253,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;"
7254,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel:"
7255,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"Judge, O you gods, how dearly Cæsar loved him!"
7256,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,This was the most unkindest cut of all:

7258,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,"Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,"
7259,ANTONY'S EULOGY ON CÆSAR.,Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart;

8616,WATERLOO.,"No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet"
8617,WATERLOO.,To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.
8618,WATERLOO.,"But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,"

8620,WATERLOO.,"And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!"

8626,WATERLOO.,And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
8627,WATERLOO.,"And when they smiled because he deemed it near,"
