68,DEDICATION,"It should be stated that some of these verses, in a slightly different"
69,DEDICATION,"form, have previously appeared in various periodicals in Binghamton,"
70,DEDICATION,"Scranton, Philadelphia and New York City, but most of them appear here"
71,DEDICATION,"for the first time, and also, perhaps it should be mentioned that some"
72,DEDICATION,"of these stanzas were written during my school days. However, the"
73,DEDICATION,majority of the following verses have been composed since the former
74,DEDICATION,booklet was published.

76,DEDICATION,"And if in any way you have been helped to see, that even here in this"
77,DEDICATION,"rugged country ""the poetry of earth is never ceasing,"" however rude my"
78,DEDICATION,"interpretation of it may seem to the critical, the labor and expense of"
79,DEDICATION,publishing this little volume will be fully justified.

119,ADVERTISEMENT,
120,ADVERTISEMENT,These booklets are not published as a financial venture--they are likely
121,ADVERTISEMENT,"to be a failure in this direction, for the cost of printing alone equals"
122,ADVERTISEMENT,"the selling price, on account of the small number issued, only 250"
123,ADVERTISEMENT,"copies, and fifty copies are not for sale. Five hundred copies of the"
124,ADVERTISEMENT,"Silent Life were printed in 1907, and I have left only 160 copies for"
125,ADVERTISEMENT,"sale. I desire to dispose of these and the small edition of ""The Comet"""
126,ADVERTISEMENT,"during the present year, so that another booklet (containing, I hope"
127,ADVERTISEMENT,still better material) may be issued during the year of 1911.

147,"IRVING DIX,","A few years ago, while recovering from an illness, I conceived the"
148,"IRVING DIX,",idea of writing some reminiscent lines on country life in the Wayne
149,"IRVING DIX,",Highlands. And during the interval of a few days I produced some five
150,"IRVING DIX,","hundred couplets,--a few good, some bad and many indifferent--and such"
151,"IRVING DIX,",speed would of necessity invite the indifferent. A portion of these
152,"IRVING DIX,","lines were published in 1907. However, I had hoped to revise and"
153,"IRVING DIX,","republish them, with additions of the same type, at a later date as a"
154,"IRVING DIX,",souvenir volume of verses for those who spend the summer months among
155,"IRVING DIX,",these hills--as well as for the home-fast inhabitants. But in
156,"IRVING DIX,",substituting the following collection of verses I hope my judgment will
157,"IRVING DIX,","be confirmed by those who chance to read these simple stanzas of one,"
158,"IRVING DIX,",who--

160,"IRVING DIX,","""Loves not man the less, but Nature more"
161,"IRVING DIX,","From those our interviews, in which I steal"
162,"IRVING DIX,","From all I may be or have been before,"
163,"IRVING DIX,",To mingle with the Universe and feel

185,BY,
186,BY,The Comet
187,BY,
188,BY,
189,BY,"Swift circuit-rider of the endless skies,"
190,BY,"Thou wanderer of the outer, unknown air,"
191,BY,"Amid those dim, uncharted regions there,"
192,BY,Imagination droops--in deep surprise
193,BY,"Man doth behold thee, and the fearful speed"
194,BY,At which thou spurrest on thy flaming steed.
195,BY,
196,BY,"Born of the dark and ever-deepening Past,"
197,BY,Who nurs'd thee there in yonder viewless space
198,BY,Afar from earth--thy all-beholding face
199,BY,"Hath gazed unspeakable, with clear eye cast"
200,BY,Worldward on each magnificent return
201,BY,As if of human progress thou wouldst learn.
202,BY,
203,BY,And thou hast seen each triumph and each plan
204,BY,By which the human race since human time
205,BY,Hath learned at last Earth's secrets all-sublime
206,BY,While rising from the elements to man--
207,BY,Hast seen it triumph over sea and air
208,BY,And universal knowledge hope to share.
209,BY,
210,BY,"Thy circuit measures well the age of man,"
211,BY,The epoch of a life--and few there be
212,BY,"Who seeing thee, thy face again may see,"
213,BY,"For human life is but a little span,"
214,BY,"With varying cycles of a different day,"
215,BY,And in diffusion wears itself away.
216,BY,
217,BY,"Child of the Sun, when first the human eye"
218,BY,Beheld thee coursing in the night afar
219,BY,Like an illumined spectre of a star--
220,BY,Beheld thy awful form against the sky
221,BY,Strong men fell earthward with a coward-cry
222,BY,"On their pale lips, as if afraid to die--"
223,BY,
224,BY,"And that brute King--Nero, the cruel King,"
225,BY,"When looking on thy fiery face unknown,"
226,BY,"Sate trembling on his little human throne,"
227,BY,And thought that thou didst evil tidings bring--
228,BY,That thou wert writing on the distant skies
229,BY,A doom from which no human king could rise.
230,BY,
231,BY,Thy age is all unknown--man can but guess
232,BY,The time when first the Sun thy circle set--
233,BY,He can but guess thy secret birth--and yet
234,BY,Observing thee his knowledge is not less;
235,BY,"He knows each cycle, each return to be"
236,BY,A moment in that vast eternity.
237,BY,
238,BY,"Recording-comet of th' immortal space,"
239,BY,What history thy eye hath look'd upon
240,BY,"Since first thy airy, circling course was run!"
241,BY,What fallen pride! What scatterings of race!
242,BY,Jerusalem and Nineveh and Rome
243,BY,Didst thou behold from thy almighty dome--
244,BY,
245,BY,"Didst thou behold--their birth, their rise, their fall--"
246,BY,"Low humbled by the under hordes at last,"
247,BY,"With glory and fair triumphs in the past,"
248,BY,And footprints of destruction over all.
249,BY,"While thou, fleet comet, with a light divine"
250,BY,Continueth upon the earth to shine.
251,BY,
252,BY,"Speed on! swift comet--turn, wanderer, turn!"
253,BY,"And with thy flaming, god-like pen of light"
254,BY,On heaven's scroll with burning letters write:
255,BY,"Live but to love, O earth!--to love and learn,"
256,BY,"For while a comet's mighty cycles fail,"
257,BY,"Love,--love and truth forever shall prevail."
258,BY,
259,BY,
260,BY,
261,BY,
262,BY,Washington
263,BY,
264,BY,
265,BY,It is forever so--when there is need
266,BY,"Of some clear, clarion voice to forward lead"
267,BY,God raiseth up a man from his own seed;
268,BY,"Not from the soft, luxurious lap of earth,"
269,BY,"But from a nobler soil, so that from birth"
270,BY,The frame is moulded with a chosen food
271,BY,"That has one only end--to make it good,"
272,BY,"Full generous, far-sighted, firm and keen,"
273,BY,With strength to rise above the gross and mean--
274,BY,The sordid selfishness that like a curse
275,BY,Drives from the heart the virtues it would nurse--
276,BY,"That love of country, freedom's holy cause,"
277,BY,"Justice, mercy, that eye for equal laws,"
278,BY,"Faith in the future and our fellow-men,"
279,BY,Faith in the sword when shielded by the pen--
280,BY,And so it was with us--when there was need
281,BY,"Of one commanding voice to forward lead,"
282,BY,God rais'd up here a man from His own seed;
283,BY,"And so came forth the gentle Washington,"
284,BY,"Fair child of Fate, the nation's noblest son,"
285,BY,Whom Virtue fostered and whom Virtue won.
286,BY,
287,BY,"Some few there be whose feet knew rougher ground,"
288,BY,But few indeed a loftier summit found--
289,BY,"Nurtured in tender soil, he held a path"
290,BY,"Where others faltered, heeding not the wrath"
291,BY,Of any king or potentate or power--
292,BY,"His was the hero-heart--he saw the hour,--"
293,BY,"He knew the mighty odds, yet would not cower."
294,BY,And when the tyrant's heel touch'd on our shore
295,BY,"And thrust itself unbidden to our door,--"
296,BY,But Washington alone with eagle-eye
297,BY,Withstood the foe and taught him how to die;
298,BY,"Repulsed, disheartened, driven to despair,"
299,BY,"He lifted up his voice in humble prayer,"
300,BY,For in that awful night at Valley Forge
301,BY,"He drank the bitter cup--he knew Fate's scourge,"
302,BY,"He felt her lash,--this tender-hearted George."
303,BY,
304,BY,"Father of Liberty--thou Child of Light,"
305,BY,"Columbia's first-born, who in thy might"
306,BY,Restored to Freedom her enfeebled sight--
307,BY,"If spirits of the nobler dead can hear,"
308,BY,This day--thy natal day--press close thine ear
309,BY,"And learn what we thy nation need to fear,"
310,BY,"And if the immortal dead can truly speak,"
311,BY,"Show us, O Child of Light, where we are weak,--"
312,BY,Grant us thy counsel (for thou art with God)
313,BY,"And bear us wisdom where thy footsteps trod,"
314,BY,And if thou seest aught of envious strife
315,BY,"From virtue sapping all her sweeter life,"
316,BY,"Teach us, O Child of Light, a purer love,"
317,BY,For thou hast learn'd of God--thou art above
318,BY,Thy weak and erring mortals here below
319,BY,"Who see the light, yet forward fear to go--"
320,BY,"Guide us, if spirits of the dead may guide,"
321,BY,"So that in peace we ever may abide,"
322,BY,"So that from land to sea, from shore to shore,"
323,BY,We shall be brothers now and evermore.
324,BY,
325,BY,
326,BY,
327,BY,
328,BY,The Storm
329,BY,
330,BY,
331,BY,"All day long the sky was cloudless,"
332,BY,"Life was waiting for a breath,"
333,BY,And the heat was more oppressive
334,BY,Than the fear of sudden death;
335,BY,All day long the sun was shining
336,BY,"In a hot and windless sky,"
337,BY,And the trees were weak for water--
338,BY,Earth and air were dead and dry.
339,BY,
340,BY,But e'er Night her wings had folded
341,BY,"Came a welcome western breeze,"
342,BY,"Moving idly through the forest,"
343,BY,"Prophesying to the trees,"
344,BY,Till above that dim horizon
345,BY,Giant clouds like warring foes
346,BY,Marshalled far in battle numbers
347,BY,As the wild winds wilder rose.
348,BY,
349,BY,Hark! O hear the double rumble
350,BY,"As the thunder shakes the air,"
351,BY,Like a thousand hoofs advancing
352,BY,In yon cloudy corral there!--
353,BY,Look!--how red the lightning flashes!
354,BY,How the echoes roll and roll--
355,BY,Dirges from some demon goddess--
356,BY,How the bells of heaven toll!
357,BY,
358,BY,"Like a lance, a flash of lightning"
359,BY,Cuts the foremost cloud in twain
360,BY,And the thunder's mighty echo
361,BY,Rolls athwart the drenching rain
362,BY,Till the landscape fades like shadows
363,BY,"In the driving sheets of spray,"
364,BY,"And the wind wails through the forest,"
365,BY,And the great trees rock and sway.
366,BY,
367,BY,Soon the air is strangely solemn
368,BY,And the winds no longer blow
369,BY,To the thunder's distant drumming
370,BY,In the valley far below;
371,BY,And along the low horizon
372,BY,"All the clouds are growing dim,"
373,BY,While upon the western hilltops
374,BY,Rolls again the sun's red rim.
375,BY,
376,BY,And away across the valley
377,BY,"In the heavens arching high,"
378,BY,Like a bed for fairy flowers
379,BY,Swings the rainbow in the sky--
380,BY,Swings until the shadows gather
381,BY,"And the sun sinks out of sight,"
382,BY,Seemingly to whisper softly
383,BY,To the world a fond good night.
384,BY,
385,BY,
386,BY,
387,BY,
388,BY,"Jim, the Newsboy"
389,BY,
390,BY,
391,BY,"Jim, the newsboy, died today,"
392,BY,So the evening papers say--
393,BY,And the funeral will be
394,BY,In the afternoon at three--
395,BY,"""Please"" (the papers say) ""a flow'r"
396,BY,Bring for Jim before the hour--
397,BY,Any color that you deem
398,BY,"A true token of esteem,"
399,BY,If you would remember him--
400,BY,"The newsboy, Jim."
401,BY,
402,BY,"At his corner near Broad street,"
403,BY,"Jim, tho' lame, would smiling greet"
404,BY,"With a merry, winning call"
405,BY,"All his patrons, great and small,"
406,BY,And his fellow newsboys say
407,BY,"That they miss him much today,"
408,BY,"And they have a tablet bought,"
409,BY,And upon it this is wrought:
410,BY,"""In memory of Newsboy Jim,"
411,BY,"We all liked him."""
412,BY,
413,BY,Little toilers on Life's road
414,BY,"To yon visionless abode,"
415,BY,There was much of good in Jim
416,BY,Or the boys had disliked him;
417,BY,There was something in his heart
418,BY,"That drew patrons to his mart,"
419,BY,"Something noble, something true--"
420,BY,Strive that it be said of you
421,BY,"As in eulogy of Jim,"
422,BY,"""We all liked him."""

427,BY,March Wind Blow
428,BY,
429,BY,
430,BY,"Bitter March-wind, blow and blow;"
431,BY,Drive away the drifting snow;
432,BY,Toss the tree-tops to and fro;
433,BY,Kiss the ice-bound lakes and streams
434,BY,And arouse them from their dreams.
435,BY,
436,BY,"Happy March-wind, blithely blow,"
437,BY,"Winter's heart is full of woe,"
438,BY,Winter's head is lying low;
439,BY,"Bring, O bring the melting rain"
440,BY,Back unto the earth again.
441,BY,
442,BY,"Weeping March-wind, blow and blow"
443,BY,Till thy tears of sorrow flow
444,BY,Down thy dying cheeks of snow--
445,BY,Weep away! for man must wait
446,BY,Till those tearful winds abate.
447,BY,
448,BY,"Merry March-wind, softer blow,"
449,BY,Let the little children know
450,BY,Where the sweetest flowers grow;
451,BY,Let thy tender accents ring
452,BY,From the joyous harp of Spring.
453,BY,
454,BY,"All ye wild-winds, blow and blow,"
455,BY,"Drive away the drifting snow,"
456,BY,"Bend the bushes, bend them low;"
457,BY,Breathe upon the trembling sod
458,BY,Springtime's messages from God.

466,I,I
467,I,
468,I,The Delaware above the Rift
469,I,"Each bank is fast o'erflowing,"
470,I,"And sweeping onward dark and swift,"
471,I,Wild and still wilder growing
472,I,It hurls a heavy raft along
473,I,"Upon its rocking way,"
474,I,While the Captain's call the hills prolong
475,I,At dawning of the day:
476,I,"Pull, lads, pull!--to Jersey side,"
477,I,The Rift is near!
478,I,"Pull, lads, pull!--for the high floods hide"
479,I,"The ragged rocks like an ocean tide,"
480,I,And the river's rush I hear.
481,I,
482,I,
483,II,II
484,II,
485,II,"Safely the Rift is left behind,"
486,II,A careful stearsman stearing;
487,II,"Swiftly we speed, only to find"
488,II,"A dizzy eddy nearing,"
489,II,"Where rolling in the river-lake,"
490,II,And whirling round and round
491,II,"A dozen rafts the circle make,"
492,II,And warning cries resound:
493,II,"Pull, lads, pull!--Sylvania's shore!"
494,II,The Eddy's near!
495,II,"Pull, lads, pull!--till the sweeping oar"
496,II,Bends like a bow and you hear the roar
497,II,Of the river in the rear.
498,II,
499,II,
500,III,III
501,III,
502,III,The luring eddy lies behind
503,III,"Where the dizzy rafts are whirling,"
504,III,"And we speed along with the cutting wind,"
505,III,"The foam like suds up-curling,"
506,III,When ahead a sharp curve comes in sight
507,III,And we hear the Captain call
508,III,As the raft swerves sudden to the right
509,III,And the ridges tower tall:
510,III,"Pull, lads, pull!--to Jersey side!"
511,III,The Bend I fear!
512,III,"Pull, lads, pull!--and soon we'll ride"
513,III,On the rolling wave to Trenton's tide
514,III,With river calm and clear.
515,III,
516,III,
517,IV,IV
518,IV,
519,IV,"The Bend is past, but the Water-gap"
520,IV,"Of the Delaware up-rearing,"
521,IV,Looms far ahead like a narrow trap
522,IV,"As fast our raft is nearing,"
523,IV,"And calm and deep the waters grow,"
524,IV,And scarcely comes a sound
525,IV,"Till the Captain's calling, to and fro"
526,IV,Re-echoes far around:
527,IV,"Rest, lads, rest!--a little while!"
528,IV,Be of good cheer!
529,IV,"Rest, lads, rest! till yonder isle"
530,IV,We safely pass--a few more mile
531,IV,And all our course is clear.
532,IV,
533,IV,
534,V,V
535,V,
536,V,Along the wave we smoothly glide
537,V,"Until the island clearing,"
538,V,"When down we speed as with the tide,"
539,V,"Now here, now there a veering,"
540,V,Until a great bridge lifts its form
541,V,"Against the evening sky,"
542,V,When like the rolling of a storm
543,V,The crew repeats the cry:
544,V,"Pull, lads, pull!--Sylvania's shore!"
545,V,The Bridge is near!
546,V,"Pull, lads, pull!--the for'ard oar,"
547,V,"And soon our dangerous task is o'er,"
548,V,And little need we fear.
549,V,
550,V,
551,VI,VI
552,VI,
553,VI,"So on we speed; now fast, now slow;"
554,VI,By isle and rift and eddy
555,VI,Until at length along we flow
556,VI,With movement firm and steady;
557,VI,"And low and lower lie the hills,"
558,VI,"And wider spreads the vale,"
559,VI,And soft the Captain's calling trills
560,VI,Upon the evening gale:
561,VI,"Rest, lads, rest!--our work is done--"
562,VI,The danger's o'er!
563,VI,"Rest, lads, rest!--another sun"
564,VI,Will see a haven safely won
565,VI,By Trenton's friendly shore.

571,VI,
572,VI,
573,VI,"We know her not whom once we knew,"
574,VI,Who died it seems e'er death was due--
575,VI,We know her not; she is asleep;
576,VI,Our hearts are dumb--we can but weep
577,VI,"That one so young must bid adieu,"
578,VI,Must part so soon from earthly view.
579,VI,
580,VI,Those tender feet we knew so late
581,VI,We hear no more; we can but wait
582,VI,To hear them in the House of God
583,VI,"When dust to dust we tread the sod,"
584,VI,For in that home of homes they wait
585,VI,For us beside the city's gate.
586,VI,
587,VI,"Those little hands out-held in love,"
588,VI,That in such innocence did move
589,VI,To fondle each familiar face
590,VI,Are still--they cannot now embrace
591,VI,As once they did so like a dove
592,VI,That weary parents would approve.
593,VI,
594,VI,Those little lips that met our own
595,VI,So sweetly when we were alone
596,VI,"No more shall meet the lips of earth,"
597,VI,Sealed up unto another birth;
598,VI,But when these larger lives have flown
599,VI,Our lips will meet; she will be known.
600,VI,
601,VI,Springtime was here--the birds would soon
602,VI,Have re-appeared--the birds would soon
603,VI,"Have warbled from a new-built nest,"
604,VI,Would soon have felt beneath their breast
605,VI,The little ones--and such a boon
606,VI,Had taught them still a sweeter tune.
607,VI,
608,VI,But of the little ones not all
609,VI,"Will answer to the parent-call,"
610,VI,Not all will learn to rise and fly--
611,VI,"Many are born, but some must die;"
612,VI,"Many will rise, but some must fall,"
613,VI,And God knows best for each and all.
614,VI,
615,VI,This is the hope--we know not how--
616,VI,"This is the hope that lures us now,"
617,VI,That makes the parting less of pain--
618,VI,"The hope that we shall meet again,"
619,VI,And so while unto grief we bow
620,VI,The road beyond seems brighter now.

696,REFRAIN.,
697,REFRAIN.,And Norma's voice is sweet to hear
698,REFRAIN.,As the breathing of a bell;

700,REFRAIN.,"Of any one afar or near,"
701,REFRAIN.,"The notes, O few can tell!"
702,REFRAIN.,"The notes, O few can tell!"
703,REFRAIN.,"Falling so wildly sweet,"

705,REFRAIN.,With the tones still incomplete.
706,REFRAIN.,
707,REFRAIN.,How came this maid upon the isle
708,REFRAIN.,Within the Hills of Wayne?
709,REFRAIN.,Why sings she sweetly all the while
710,REFRAIN.,As if to ease her self-denial?
711,REFRAIN.,Why sings she a refrain
712,REFRAIN.,At the lonely midnight hour
713,REFRAIN.,"On an island dark with trees,"
714,REFRAIN.,Enchanting souls unto her bower
715,REFRAIN.,By such sweet melodies?
716,REFRAIN.,
717,REFRAIN.,The legend runs:--That long ago
718,REFRAIN.,"A lover came to woo,"
719,REFRAIN.,But left her--why?--(no man doth know)
720,REFRAIN.,For while her love like wine did flow
721,REFRAIN.,Away from her he drew--
722,REFRAIN.,"He drew from her away,"
723,REFRAIN.,While she was left forlorn
724,REFRAIN.,And ever (so the legends say)
725,REFRAIN.,Did daily for him mourn.
726,REFRAIN.,
727,REFRAIN.,But Norma left her home one night
728,REFRAIN.,When all were fast asleep
729,REFRAIN.,And angel-like she trod the light
730,REFRAIN.,Moonpath across the waters bright
731,REFRAIN.,"Until she ceased to weep,"
732,REFRAIN.,"Until she ceased to weep,"
733,REFRAIN.,"Singing a sweet, sweet song"

735,REFRAIN.,The night-wind did prolong.
736,REFRAIN.,
737,REFRAIN.,"And after Norma's death, one day"
738,REFRAIN.,A knock at her father's door
739,REFRAIN.,Announced the lad who went away
740,REFRAIN.,"When both were lovers young and gay,"
741,REFRAIN.,Who now would love her more
742,REFRAIN.,"Than any other maid,"

744,REFRAIN.,"Saying, O where is Norma now,"
745,REFRAIN.,Where is my sweetheart now?
746,REFRAIN.,
747,REFRAIN.,"O Youth, my daughter is not here--"
748,REFRAIN.,"She waited, waited long"
749,REFRAIN.,To hear the voice she held more dear
750,REFRAIN.,Than all the rest--nor could we cheer
751,REFRAIN.,Her with another song;
752,REFRAIN.,But many hear her sing
753,REFRAIN.,"By the island,--sing so sweet"
754,REFRAIN.,"That never, never can they bring"
755,REFRAIN.,The song to me complete.
756,REFRAIN.,
757,REFRAIN.,The lover sadly turned away
758,REFRAIN.,And vowed that he would know
759,REFRAIN.,The song complete e'er dawn of day
760,REFRAIN.,And followed where the moonpath lay
761,REFRAIN.,"Upon the lake below,"
762,REFRAIN.,Where Norma sang of love
763,REFRAIN.,On the island dark with trees
764,REFRAIN.,"That cast deep shadows on the cove,"
765,REFRAIN.,And his heart was ill at ease.
766,REFRAIN.,
767,REFRAIN.,At midnight o'er the moonlit wave
768,REFRAIN.,"He bent his little boat,"
769,REFRAIN.,"Till he heard the song the soft winds gave,"
770,REFRAIN.,"But if his life that song might save,"
771,REFRAIN.,He could not tell a note!
772,REFRAIN.,He could not learn a note!
773,REFRAIN.,"Tho' many, and many, and many a night"
774,REFRAIN.,In the lovely moonpath gleaming bright
775,REFRAIN.,He listened from his boat.
776,REFRAIN.,
777,REFRAIN.,"But the song he never, never knew"
778,REFRAIN.,"Altho' he listened long,"
779,REFRAIN.,And so it is--is ever true
780,REFRAIN.,When hearts withhold a love long due;
781,REFRAIN.,"For Love sings one sweet song,"
782,REFRAIN.,"One sweet familiar song,"

998,REQUIEM:,Thru the night?
999,REQUIEM:,
1000,REQUIEM:,"Can there be, Angel of Love"
1001,REQUIEM:,Can there be bright homes above--
1002,REQUIEM:,What is Life--and when it endeth
1003,REQUIEM:,What is Death--why it descendeth
1004,REQUIEM:,I implore?
1005,REQUIEM:,
1006,REQUIEM:,"Tell me, Angel, can it be"

1018,REQUIEM:,
1019,REQUIEM:,
1020,REQUIEM:,The shadows fall on Twin Lake fair
1021,REQUIEM:,As crimson sets the Autumn sun;
1022,REQUIEM:,A holy hush is on the air
1023,REQUIEM:,Of eventide and day is done.
1024,REQUIEM:,
1025,REQUIEM:,No zephyrs kiss the little lake;
1026,REQUIEM:,"So still and calm is either shore,"
1027,REQUIEM:,That on her face dim shadows wake
1028,REQUIEM:,And deepen ever more and more.
1029,REQUIEM:,
1030,REQUIEM:,And where the long-leaf laurels grow
1031,REQUIEM:,"A cuckoo sounds the hour of rest,"
1032,REQUIEM:,And fondly answering far below
1033,REQUIEM:,Its mate is calling from her nest.
1034,REQUIEM:,
1035,REQUIEM:,"Now comes the twilight, calm and still,"
1036,REQUIEM:,"And, with a cloak of sable hue,"
1037,REQUIEM:,Half hides the lake and upland hill
1038,REQUIEM:,That faint and fainter fades from view.
1039,REQUIEM:,
1040,REQUIEM:,And through the broken web of night
1041,REQUIEM:,Each stalwart star with even ray
1042,REQUIEM:,Reflects upon the lake a light
1043,REQUIEM:,To guide a boatman on his way.
1044,REQUIEM:,
1045,REQUIEM:,And soon the massive moon doth ride
1046,REQUIEM:,"Athwart the pine trees' heavy shade,"
1047,REQUIEM:,"That doth her fiery chariot hide,"
1048,REQUIEM:,As an apparent halt is made.
1049,REQUIEM:,
1050,REQUIEM:,And sweetly from a maiden fair
1051,REQUIEM:,In yon canoe that skirts the shore
1052,REQUIEM:,A laugh rings out upon the air
1053,REQUIEM:,And echoes softly o'er and o'er
1054,REQUIEM:,
1055,REQUIEM:,"Till dying on the distant hill,"
1056,REQUIEM:,"An evening silence settles far,--"
1057,REQUIEM:,"A quietness, so calm, so still,"
1058,REQUIEM:,With rising moon and silent star--
1059,REQUIEM:,
1060,REQUIEM:,"That peace, sweet peace subdues the soul,"
1061,REQUIEM:,While on the clear and pensive air
1062,REQUIEM:,The bells of Como softly toll
1063,REQUIEM:,The ever-sacred hour of prayer.

1070,REQUIEM:,
1071,REQUIEM:,"It is often, yes, often that the man who swears"
1072,REQUIEM:,Is a man who dares and a man who cares;
1073,REQUIEM:,For the gentle voice and the eye of blue
1074,REQUIEM:,Will sometimes tell of a heart less true
1075,REQUIEM:,"Than the rough, cold voice and manner stern--"
1076,REQUIEM:,And you some day this truth will learn:--
1077,REQUIEM:,"That often, yes, often that the man who swears"
1078,REQUIEM:,Is a man who dares and a man who cares.
1079,REQUIEM:,
1080,REQUIEM:,"When you are sick with fever and pain,"
1081,REQUIEM:,Who comes to ease your weary brain?
1082,REQUIEM:,Is it the friend with the eyes of blue
1083,REQUIEM:,"And gentle voice that comes to you,"
1084,REQUIEM:,"Or, is it the one with manner cold"
1085,REQUIEM:,"And voice so stern and ways so bold,"
1086,REQUIEM:,That presses a hand on your fevered brow
1087,REQUIEM:,And soothes your troubled spirits now.
1088,REQUIEM:,
1089,REQUIEM:,"When you are down and your friends are few,"
1090,REQUIEM:,Who is it comes to comfort you?
1091,REQUIEM:,Is it the one with eyes so mild
1092,REQUIEM:,And voice as sweet as a little child--
1093,REQUIEM:,Is it the one with gentle way
1094,REQUIEM:,That comes to you and dares to say:--
1095,REQUIEM:,"So sorry, friend; say, here's my hand,"
1096,REQUIEM:,I'll do your bidding; now just command?
1097,REQUIEM:,
1098,REQUIEM:,When in misfortune you need a friend
1099,REQUIEM:,Who will fight for you to the bitter end--
1100,REQUIEM:,Is it always the one who speaks quite low
1101,REQUIEM:,"And fears to say what he knows, is so,"
1102,REQUIEM:,Or is it the man who speaks his mind
1103,REQUIEM:,And shows some mettle--and hardly kind
1104,REQUIEM:,Whose heart is cold until your woe
1105,REQUIEM:,Melts an entrance as the sun melts snow?
1106,REQUIEM:,
1107,REQUIEM:,I would not say that swearing is right
1108,REQUIEM:,But I say some men are willing to fight--
1109,REQUIEM:,"It is wrong indeed for a man to swear,"
1110,REQUIEM:,And I envy no one's weakness there--
1111,REQUIEM:,"Still I believe, with me you would say"
1112,REQUIEM:,While one will swear and another pray
1113,REQUIEM:,You would follow the man who is willing to dare
1114,REQUIEM:,Tho one might pray and the other swear.

1123,REQUIEM:,Hath cut a chasm; and each pool
1124,REQUIEM:,"Reflects a narrow, rocky room"
1125,REQUIEM:,"Where sun-born flowers seldom bloom,"
1126,REQUIEM:,"But where the ledging, level shelves"
1127,REQUIEM:,Betray the dance hall of the elves.
1128,REQUIEM:,
1129,REQUIEM:,And overhead the tasseled trees
1130,REQUIEM:,"Frown from the wall, and with each breeze"
1131,REQUIEM:,"Awake the solemn avenue,"
1132,REQUIEM:,"But hide from sight the upward view,"
1133,REQUIEM:,When with a hundred harps they sing
1134,REQUIEM:,To Boreas their mighty king.
1135,REQUIEM:,
1136,REQUIEM:,"Here Echo dwells in lonely mood,"
1137,REQUIEM:,And answers to the dying wood;
1138,REQUIEM:,Unsuited to a varying rhyme
1139,REQUIEM:,She hath no voice for tuneful Time
1140,REQUIEM:,Content to speak as she hath heard
1141,REQUIEM:,"The lyric wind, the singing bird."
1142,REQUIEM:,
1143,REQUIEM:,Here these same falls awoke the glen

1145,REQUIEM:,"Long, long before yon broken soil"
1146,REQUIEM:,Brought forth the fruit of human toil
1147,REQUIEM:,And here these falls will dance and play
1148,REQUIEM:,When feeling man has passed away.
1149,REQUIEM:,
1150,REQUIEM:,"Sing little Falls; and echo Glen,"
1151,REQUIEM:,Till silent are the songs of men
1152,REQUIEM:,And they that dwell upon the earth
1153,REQUIEM:,Have disappeared as at thy birth
1154,REQUIEM:,"And senseless Rock--if think ye can,"

1169,REQUIEM:,"O Hope, when left at last alone"
1170,REQUIEM:,We fall a suppliant at thy feet

1178,REQUIEM:,From out the world shouldst thou ascend

1181,REQUIEM:,"And Hatred every evil one,--"
1182,REQUIEM:,"O Hope, for more would seek the grave"
1183,REQUIEM:,Without thy timely vision shown:--
1184,REQUIEM:,The sick upon the lowly bed;
1185,REQUIEM:,The blind a-begging as of yore;
1186,REQUIEM:,The weeping child who works unfed;
1187,REQUIEM:,"The prisoner by the fatal door,"
1188,REQUIEM:,"All, led along, still cling below"
1189,REQUIEM:,"To feel thy subtle charms so free,"
1190,REQUIEM:,"As wearily, drearily on they go,"

1193,REQUIEM:,"And when upon Life's field they fall,"
