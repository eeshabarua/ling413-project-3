179,THE SKY,
180,THE SKY,
181,THE SKY,I saw a shadow on the ground
182,THE SKY,And heard a bluejay going by;
183,THE SKY,"A shadow went across the ground,"
184,THE SKY,And I looked up and saw the sky.
185,THE SKY,
186,THE SKY,"It hung up on the poplar tree,"
187,THE SKY,But while I looked it did not stay;
188,THE SKY,It gave a tiny sort of jerk
189,THE SKY,And moved a little bit away.
190,THE SKY,
191,THE SKY,And farther on and farther on
192,THE SKY,It moved and never seemed to stop.
193,THE SKY,I think it must be tied with chains
194,THE SKY,And something pulls it from the top.
195,THE SKY,
196,THE SKY,"It never has come down again,"
197,THE SKY,"And every time I look to see,"
198,THE SKY,The sky is always slipping back
199,THE SKY,And getting far away from me.

204,THE CORNFIELD,THE CORNFIELD
205,THE CORNFIELD,
206,THE CORNFIELD,
207,THE CORNFIELD,I went across the pasture lot
208,THE CORNFIELD,When not a one was watching me.
209,THE CORNFIELD,Away beyond the cattle barns
210,THE CORNFIELD,I climbed a little crooked tree.
211,THE CORNFIELD,
212,THE CORNFIELD,And I could look down on the field
213,THE CORNFIELD,And see the corn and how it grows
214,THE CORNFIELD,Across the world and up and down
215,THE CORNFIELD,In very straight and even rows.
216,THE CORNFIELD,
217,THE CORNFIELD,And far away and far away--
218,THE CORNFIELD,I wonder if the farmer man
219,THE CORNFIELD,Knows all about the corn and how
220,THE CORNFIELD,It comes together like a fan.

225,MILKING TIME,MILKING TIME
226,MILKING TIME,
227,MILKING TIME,
228,MILKING TIME,"When supper time is almost come,"
229,MILKING TIME,"But not quite here, I cannot wait,"
230,MILKING TIME,And so I take my china mug
231,MILKING TIME,And go down by the milking gate.
232,MILKING TIME,
233,MILKING TIME,The cow is always eating shucks
234,MILKING TIME,And spilling off the little silk.
235,MILKING TIME,Her purple eyes are big and soft--
236,MILKING TIME,She always smells like milk.
237,MILKING TIME,
238,MILKING TIME,"And Father takes my mug from me,"
239,MILKING TIME,And then he makes the stream come out.
240,MILKING TIME,I see it going in my mug
241,MILKING TIME,And foaming all about.
242,MILKING TIME,
243,MILKING TIME,"And when it's piling very high,"
244,MILKING TIME,And when some little streams commence
245,MILKING TIME,"To run and drip along the sides,"
246,MILKING TIME,He hands it to me through the fence.
247,MILKING TIME,
248,MILKING TIME,

251,IN MY PILLOW,IN MY PILLOW
252,IN MY PILLOW,
253,IN MY PILLOW,
254,IN MY PILLOW,"When Mother or Father turns down the light,"
255,IN MY PILLOW,I like to look into my pillow at night.
256,IN MY PILLOW,
257,IN MY PILLOW,"Some people call them dreams, but for me"
258,IN MY PILLOW,They are things I look down in my pillow and see.
259,IN MY PILLOW,
260,IN MY PILLOW,"I saw some birds, as many as four,"
261,IN MY PILLOW,That were all blue wings and nothing else more.
262,IN MY PILLOW,
263,IN MY PILLOW,"Without any head and without any feet,"
264,IN MY PILLOW,Just blue wings flying over a street.
265,IN MY PILLOW,
266,IN MY PILLOW,And almost every night I see
267,IN MY PILLOW,"A little brown bowl that can talk to me,"
268,IN MY PILLOW,
269,IN MY PILLOW,"A nice little bowl that laughs and sings,"
270,IN MY PILLOW,And ever so many other things.
271,IN MY PILLOW,
272,IN MY PILLOW,"Sometimes they are plainer than I can say,"
273,IN MY PILLOW,And while I am waking they go away.
274,IN MY PILLOW,
275,IN MY PILLOW,"And when nobody is coming by,"
276,IN MY PILLOW,I feel my pillow all over and try
277,IN MY PILLOW,
278,IN MY PILLOW,"And try to feel the pretty things,"
279,IN MY PILLOW,The little brown bowl and the flying wings.

290,MISS KATE-MARIE,Me down to see Miss Kate-Marie.
291,MISS KATE-MARIE,
292,MISS KATE-MARIE,And when I went it all turned out
293,MISS KATE-MARIE,"To be a Sunday school, and there"
294,MISS KATE-MARIE,Miss Kate-Marie was very good
295,MISS KATE-MARIE,And let me stand beside her chair.
296,MISS KATE-MARIE,
297,MISS KATE-MARIE,Her hat was made of yellow lace;
298,MISS KATE-MARIE,"Her dress was very soft and thin,"
299,MISS KATE-MARIE,And when she talked her little tongue
300,MISS KATE-MARIE,Was always wriggling out and in.
301,MISS KATE-MARIE,
302,MISS KATE-MARIE,I liked to smell my pretty rose;
303,MISS KATE-MARIE,I liked to feel her silky dress.
304,MISS KATE-MARIE,She held a very little book
305,MISS KATE-MARIE,And asked the things for us to guess.
306,MISS KATE-MARIE,
307,MISS KATE-MARIE,"She asked about Who-made-y-God,"
308,MISS KATE-MARIE,And never seemed to fuss or frown;

322,THE WOODPECKER,And he had on a hood and a collar of red.

426,DICK AND WILL,But they are not the same at all;
427,DICK AND WILL,"Two different boys they have to be,"

429,DICK AND WILL,When Will is climbing in a tree.
430,DICK AND WILL,
431,DICK AND WILL,Or maybe Will is on the porch

792,BABES IN THE WOODS,"Came with strawberry leaves in her bill,"
793,BABES IN THE WOODS,
794,BABES IN THE WOODS,"To cover them up, and she kept very quiet"
795,BABES IN THE WOODS,"And brought the leaves one at a time, I think."
796,BABES IN THE WOODS,"And some of the leaves would have little holes in them,"
797,BABES IN THE WOODS,And some would be red and pink.
798,BABES IN THE WOODS,
799,BABES IN THE WOODS,And these little Babes-in-the-Woods that were dead

802,BABES IN THE WOODS,And maybe they even could hear the ants walk.
803,BABES IN THE WOODS,

805,BABES IN THE WOODS,And see little bushes and some of the sky.

818,THE PICNIC,We rode on the wagon full of hay.
819,THE PICNIC,
820,THE PICNIC,"There were more little girls than ten, I guess."
821,THE PICNIC,And the boy that is Joe B. Kirk was there.
822,THE PICNIC,"He found a toad and a katydid,"
823,THE PICNIC,And a little girl came whose name was Clare.
824,THE PICNIC,
825,THE PICNIC,Miss Kate-Marie made us play a song
826,THE PICNIC,"Called ""Fare-you-well, says Johnny O'Brown."""
827,THE PICNIC,"You dance in a ring and sing it through,"
828,THE PICNIC,And then some one kneels down.
829,THE PICNIC,
830,THE PICNIC,She kissed us all and Joe B. Kirk;
831,THE PICNIC,But Joe B. didn't mind a bit.
832,THE PICNIC,He walked around and swung his arms
833,THE PICNIC,And seemed to be very glad of it.
834,THE PICNIC,
835,THE PICNIC,"Then Mr. Jim said he would play,"
836,THE PICNIC,"But Miss Marie, she told him then,"
837,THE PICNIC,"It's a game for her and the little folks,"
838,THE PICNIC,And he could go and fish with the men.
839,THE PICNIC,
840,THE PICNIC,Mr. Wells was there and he had a rope
841,THE PICNIC,To tie to a limb and make it swing.
842,THE PICNIC,"And Mrs. Wells, Mr. Wells's wife,"
843,THE PICNIC,Gave me a peach and a chicken wing.
844,THE PICNIC,
845,THE PICNIC,And I had a little cherry pie
846,THE PICNIC,"And a piece of bread, and after we'd played"

859,MUMPS,At all because I had the mumps.
860,MUMPS,
861,MUMPS,"And Mother tied it with a piece,"

863,MUMPS,And no one else but Dick was left
864,MUMPS,That didn't have a mump rag on.
865,MUMPS,
866,MUMPS,"He teased at us and laughed at us,"
867,MUMPS,"And said, whenever he went by,"
868,MUMPS,"""It's vinegar and lemon drops"
869,MUMPS,"And pickles!"" just to make us cry."
870,MUMPS,
871,MUMPS,But Tuesday Dick was very sad

886,THE CIRCUS,

888,THE CIRCUS,"And you never could guess what they had inside,"
889,THE CIRCUS,"Nobody could guess, for the doors were shut,"

891,THE CIRCUS,
892,THE CIRCUS,A man on the top of a sort of cart
893,THE CIRCUS,Was clapping his hands and making a talk.
894,THE CIRCUS,And the elephant came--he can step pretty far--
895,THE CIRCUS,It made us laugh to see him walk.
896,THE CIRCUS,
897,THE CIRCUS,"Three beautiful ladies came riding by,"
898,THE CIRCUS,"And each one had on a golden dress,"

917,STRANGE TREE,
918,STRANGE TREE,The road was going on and on
919,STRANGE TREE,Beyond to reach some other place.
920,STRANGE TREE,"I saw a tree that looked at me,"

922,STRANGE TREE,
923,STRANGE TREE,It looked at me with all its limbs;
924,STRANGE TREE,It looked at me with all its bark.
925,STRANGE TREE,The yellow wrinkles on its sides
926,STRANGE TREE,Were bent and dark.
927,STRANGE TREE,

941,THE BRANCH,We hid our things by the osage tree
942,THE BRANCH,And took off our shoes and stockings to wade.
943,THE BRANCH,
944,THE BRANCH,"There is sand at the bottom that bites at your feet,"
945,THE BRANCH,And there is a rock where the waterfall goes.
946,THE BRANCH,You can poke your foot in the foamy part
947,THE BRANCH,And feel how the water runs over your toes.
948,THE BRANCH,
949,THE BRANCH,The little black spiders that walk on the top
950,THE BRANCH,Of the water are hard and stiff and cool.
951,THE BRANCH,"And I saw some wiggletails going around,"
952,THE BRANCH,And some slippery minnows that live in the pool.
953,THE BRANCH,
954,THE BRANCH,"And where it is smooth there is moss on a stone,"
955,THE BRANCH,And where it is shallow and almost dry
956,THE BRANCH,"The rocks are broken and hot in the sun,"

968,THE WORM,And I was digging with a shell.
969,THE WORM,
970,THE WORM,Then Will said he would dig one too.
971,THE WORM,"We shaped them out and made them wide,"
972,THE WORM,And I dug up a piece of clod
973,THE WORM,That had a little worm inside.
974,THE WORM,
975,THE WORM,We watched him pucker up himself
976,THE WORM,And stretch himself to walk away.
977,THE WORM,"He tried to go inside the dirt,"
978,THE WORM,But Dickie made him wait and stay.
979,THE WORM,
980,THE WORM,His shining skin was soft and wet.
981,THE WORM,I poked him once to see him squirm.
982,THE WORM,"And then Will said, ""I wonder if"
983,THE WORM,"He knows that he's a worm."""
984,THE WORM,
985,THE WORM,And then we sat back on our feet
986,THE WORM,And wondered for a little bit.
987,THE WORM,And we forgot to dig our wells
988,THE WORM,"Awhile, and tried to answer it."
989,THE WORM,
990,THE WORM,"And while we tried to find it out,"
991,THE WORM,"He puckered in a little wad,"

1133,IN THE NIGHT,
1134,IN THE NIGHT,I saw him crowd his body down

1149,IN THE NIGHT,"Its legs were flat against the chair,"
1150,IN THE NIGHT,Its arms were hanging like a swing.
1151,IN THE NIGHT,"It made its eye look into me,"

1238,THE SUNDAY BONNET,And there was a bonnet put away
1239,THE SUNDAY BONNET,For Polly to wear when she went to church.
1240,THE SUNDAY BONNET,She would not wear it every day.
1241,THE SUNDAY BONNET,
1242,THE SUNDAY BONNET,"It had some little flowers on,"
1243,THE SUNDAY BONNET,And it was standing on its head
1244,THE SUNDAY BONNET,"In a bonnet box where it was safe,"
1245,THE SUNDAY BONNET,Away up stairs on the company's bed.
1246,THE SUNDAY BONNET,
1247,THE SUNDAY BONNET,"And Grandmother Polly was going to church,"
1248,THE SUNDAY BONNET,And she sent her Alice up the stair--
1249,THE SUNDAY BONNET,Alice was black--she was Evaline's child--
1250,THE SUNDAY BONNET,She waited on Polly and combed her hair.
1251,THE SUNDAY BONNET,
1252,THE SUNDAY BONNET,"And Alice said, ""Oh, lawsie me!"""
1253,THE SUNDAY BONNET,And then she cried and came running down.
1254,THE SUNDAY BONNET,"And everyone went to see, and the cat"
1255,THE SUNDAY BONNET,Had five little cats in the bonnet crown.

1267,THE SUN AND A BIRCH TREE,And my coat was powdered gray with drops.
1268,THE SUN AND A BIRCH TREE,
1269,THE SUN AND A BIRCH TREE,Then I looked in the woods to see
1270,THE SUN AND A BIRCH TREE,The limbs of the white birch tree.
1271,THE SUN AND A BIRCH TREE,

1306,AUTUMN FIELDS,"For he had gone some twenty-eight miles,"
1307,AUTUMN FIELDS,And he'd walked through by watergaps

1310,AUTUMN FIELDS,"He said he'd been by Logan's woods,"

1314,AUTUMN FIELDS,
1315,AUTUMN FIELDS,"And then he sat down on the steps,"
1316,AUTUMN FIELDS,And he said the miles were on his feet.
1317,AUTUMN FIELDS,"For some of that land was tangled brush,"
1318,AUTUMN FIELDS,And some was plowed for wheat.
1319,AUTUMN FIELDS,
1320,AUTUMN FIELDS,"The rabbits were thick where he had been,"
1321,AUTUMN FIELDS,And he said he'd found some ripe papaws.

1323,AUTUMN FIELDS,And for his dinner he ate red haws.
1324,AUTUMN FIELDS,
1325,AUTUMN FIELDS,Then I sat by him on the step

1419,SHELLS IN ROCK,You see them in foundation stones;
1420,SHELLS IN ROCK,They show in creeks and waterfalls;

1424,SHELLS IN ROCK,We walk on them when we walk on roads;

1438,HORSE,The post was drab and he was brown.
1439,HORSE,
1440,HORSE,"His nose was long and hard and still,"
1441,HORSE,And on his lip were specks like chalk.
1442,HORSE,"But once he opened up his eyes,"
1443,HORSE,And he began to talk.
1444,HORSE,
1445,HORSE,He didn't talk out with his mouth;
1446,HORSE,He didn't talk with words or noise.
1447,HORSE,The talk was there along his nose;
1448,HORSE,It seemed and then it was.
1449,HORSE,
1450,HORSE,"He said the day was hot and slow,"
1451,HORSE,And he said he didn't like the flies;

1454,HORSE,
1455,HORSE,He said that drab was just about
