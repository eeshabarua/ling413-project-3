215,OTHER POEMS,
216,OTHER POEMS,"Lincoln, the Man of the People"
217,OTHER POEMS,
218,OTHER POEMS,
219,OTHER POEMS,"When the Norn-Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour,"
220,OTHER POEMS,"Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,"
221,OTHER POEMS,She bent the strenuous Heavens and came down
222,OTHER POEMS,To make a man to meet the mortal need.
223,OTHER POEMS,She took the tried clay of the common road—
224,OTHER POEMS,"Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,"
225,OTHER POEMS,Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;
226,OTHER POEMS,Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.
227,OTHER POEMS,"It was a stuff to wear for centuries,"
228,OTHER POEMS,"A man that matched the mountains, and compelled"
229,OTHER POEMS,The stars to look our way and honor us.
230,OTHER POEMS,
231,OTHER POEMS,"The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;"
232,OTHER POEMS,The tang and odor of the primal things—
233,OTHER POEMS,The rectitude and patience of the rocks;
234,OTHER POEMS,The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
235,OTHER POEMS,The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
236,OTHER POEMS,The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;
237,OTHER POEMS,The pity of the snow that hides all scars;
238,OTHER POEMS,The loving-kindness of the wayside well;
239,OTHER POEMS,The tolerance and equity of light
240,OTHER POEMS,That gives as freely to the shrinking weed
241,OTHER POEMS,As to the great oak flaring to the wind—
242,OTHER POEMS,To the grave’s low hill as to the Matterhorn
243,OTHER POEMS,That shoulders out the sky.
244,OTHER POEMS,
245,OTHER POEMS,And so he came.
246,OTHER POEMS,"From prairie cabin up to Capitol,"
247,OTHER POEMS,One fair Ideal led our chieftain on.
248,OTHER POEMS,Forevermore he burned to do his deed
249,OTHER POEMS,With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.
250,OTHER POEMS,"He built the rail-pile as he built the State,"
251,OTHER POEMS,"Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,"
252,OTHER POEMS,"The conscience of him testing every stroke,"
253,OTHER POEMS,To make his deed the measure of a man.
254,OTHER POEMS,
255,OTHER POEMS,So came the Captain with the mighty heart:
256,OTHER POEMS,"And when the step of Earthquake shook the house,"
257,OTHER POEMS,"Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,"
258,OTHER POEMS,"He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again"
259,OTHER POEMS,The rafters of the Home. He held his place—
260,OTHER POEMS,Held the long purpose like a growing tree—
261,OTHER POEMS,Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.
262,OTHER POEMS,"And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down"
263,OTHER POEMS,As when a kingly cedar green with boughs
264,OTHER POEMS,"Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,"
265,OTHER POEMS,And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.
266,OTHER POEMS,

270,OTHER POEMS,In a Corn-field
271,OTHER POEMS,
272,OTHER POEMS,
273,OTHER POEMS,"Who was it passed me, his body a-throbbing?"
274,OTHER POEMS,Who but Sir Humblebee home from his robbing!
275,OTHER POEMS,
276,OTHER POEMS,What is that crackle of chariots whirling?
277,OTHER POEMS,‘Tis Cricket Achilles where green smoke is curling.
278,OTHER POEMS,
279,OTHER POEMS,And who is it comes on the bloom-ocean steering?
280,OTHER POEMS,"Bold Dragonfly Cortez, a-tacking and veering!"
281,OTHER POEMS,
282,OTHER POEMS,
283,OTHER POEMS,
284,OTHER POEMS,
285,OTHER POEMS,The Sower
286,OTHER POEMS,
287,OTHER POEMS,_Written after seeing Millet’s painting with this title_
288,OTHER POEMS,
289,OTHER POEMS,
290,OTHER POEMS,Soon will the lonesome cricket by the stone
291,OTHER POEMS,Begin to hush the night; and lightly blown
292,OTHER POEMS,Field fragrances will fill the fading blue—
293,OTHER POEMS,Old furrow-scents that ancient Eden knew.
294,OTHER POEMS,Soon in the upper twilight will be heard
295,OTHER POEMS,The winging whisper of a homing bird.
296,OTHER POEMS,
297,OTHER POEMS,"Who is it coming on the slant brown slope,"
298,OTHER POEMS,Touched by the twilight and her mournful hope—
299,OTHER POEMS,"Coming with hero step, with rhythmic swing,"
300,OTHER POEMS,Where all the bodily motions weave and sing?
301,OTHER POEMS,"The grief of the ground is in him, yet the power"
302,OTHER POEMS,Of Earth to hide the furrow with the flower.
303,OTHER POEMS,
304,OTHER POEMS,"He is the stone rejected, yet the stone"
305,OTHER POEMS,Whereon is built metropolis and throne.
306,OTHER POEMS,"Out of his toil come all their pompous shows,"
307,OTHER POEMS,Their purple luxury and plush repose!
308,OTHER POEMS,
309,OTHER POEMS,The grime of this bruised hand keeps tender white
310,OTHER POEMS,"The hands that never labor, day nor night."
311,OTHER POEMS,His feet that know only the field’s rough floors
312,OTHER POEMS,Send lordly steps down echoing corridors.
313,OTHER POEMS,
314,OTHER POEMS,"Yea, this vicarious toiler at the plow"
315,OTHER POEMS,Gives that fine pallor to my lady’s brow.
316,OTHER POEMS,"And idle armies with their boom and blare,"
317,OTHER POEMS,Flinging their foolish glory on the air—
318,OTHER POEMS,"He hides their nakedness, he gives them bed,"
319,OTHER POEMS,And by his alms their hungry mouths are fed.
320,OTHER POEMS,
321,OTHER POEMS,"Not his the lurching of an aimless clod,"
322,OTHER POEMS,For with the august gesture of a god—
323,OTHER POEMS,A gesture that is question and command—
324,OTHER POEMS,He hurls the bread of nations from his hand;
325,OTHER POEMS,And in the passion of the gesture flings
326,OTHER POEMS,His fierce resentment in the face of kings.
327,OTHER POEMS,
328,OTHER POEMS,"This is the Earth-god of the latter day,"
329,OTHER POEMS,Treading with solemn joy the upward way;
330,OTHER POEMS,A lusty god that in some crowning hour
331,OTHER POEMS,Will hurl Gray Privilege from the place of power.
332,OTHER POEMS,These are the inevitable steps that make
333,OTHER POEMS,Unreason tremble and Tradition shake.
334,OTHER POEMS,"This is the World-Will climbing to its goal,"
335,OTHER POEMS,The climb of the unconquerable Soul—
336,OTHER POEMS,Democracy whose sure insurgent stride
337,OTHER POEMS,Jars kingdoms to their ultimate stone of pride.
338,OTHER POEMS,
339,OTHER POEMS,
340,OTHER POEMS,
341,OTHER POEMS,
342,OTHER POEMS,At Little Virgil’s Window
343,OTHER POEMS,
344,OTHER POEMS,
345,OTHER POEMS,"There are three green eggs in a small brown pocket,"
346,OTHER POEMS,"And the breeze will swing and the gale will rock it,"
347,OTHER POEMS,"Till three little birds on the thin edge teeter,"
348,OTHER POEMS,And our God be glad and our world be sweeter!

351,OTHER POEMS,
352,OTHER POEMS,
353,OTHER POEMS,The Muse of Brotherhood
354,OTHER POEMS,
355,OTHER POEMS,
356,OTHER POEMS,I am in the Expectancy that runs:
357,OTHER POEMS,"My feet are in the Future, whirled afar"
358,OTHER POEMS,"On wings of light. If I have any sons,"
359,OTHER POEMS,Let them arise and follow to my star.
360,OTHER POEMS,
361,OTHER POEMS,Some momentary touches of my fire
362,OTHER POEMS,Have warmed the barren ages with a beam:
363,OTHER POEMS,"There is no peak beyond my swift desire,"
364,OTHER POEMS,There is no beauty deeper than my dream.
365,OTHER POEMS,
366,OTHER POEMS,I make an end of life’s stupendous jest—
367,OTHER POEMS,"The merry waste of fortunes by the Few,"
368,OTHER POEMS,While the thin faces of the poor are pressed
369,OTHER POEMS,Against the panes—a hungry whirlwind crew.
370,OTHER POEMS,
371,OTHER POEMS,"I come to lift the soul-destroying weight,"
372,OTHER POEMS,"To heal the hurt, to end the foolish loss,"
373,OTHER POEMS,To take the toiler from his brutal fate—
374,OTHER POEMS,The toiler hanging on the Labor Cross.
375,OTHER POEMS,
376,OTHER POEMS,"I bring to Earth the feel of home again,"
377,OTHER POEMS,"That men may nestle on her warm, still breast;"
378,OTHER POEMS,"I bring to wronged, humiliated men"
379,OTHER POEMS,The sacred right to labor and to rest.
380,OTHER POEMS,
381,OTHER POEMS,I bring to men the fine ideal stuff
382,OTHER POEMS,The young gods took to build the spheres of old:
383,OTHER POEMS,The fire I send on men is great enough
384,OTHER POEMS,To burn the iron kingdoms into gold.
385,OTHER POEMS,
386,OTHER POEMS,I hold the way until the bright heavens bend—
387,OTHER POEMS,"Until the New Republic shall arise,"
388,OTHER POEMS,"And quick young deities again descend,"
389,OTHER POEMS,Bringing the gifts of God with joyous cries.
390,OTHER POEMS,
391,OTHER POEMS,I lead the Graces and the Wingèd Powers:
392,OTHER POEMS,"The world the Anarchs build I will destroy,"
393,OTHER POEMS,"For I will storm upon its demon towers,"
394,OTHER POEMS,With wind of laughter and with rain of joy.
395,OTHER POEMS,
396,OTHER POEMS,And at the first break of my Social Song
397,OTHER POEMS,"A hush will fall upon the foolish strife,"
398,OTHER POEMS,"As though a joyous god, serene and strong,"
399,OTHER POEMS,Shined suddenly before the steps of life.
400,OTHER POEMS,
401,OTHER POEMS,Cold hearts that falter are my only bar:
402,OTHER POEMS,Heroes that seek my ever-fading goal
403,OTHER POEMS,"Must take their reckoning from the central star,"
404,OTHER POEMS,And follow the equator: I am Soul.
405,OTHER POEMS,
406,OTHER POEMS,"My love is higher than heavens where Taurus wheels,"
407,OTHER POEMS,My love is deeper than the pillared skies:
408,OTHER POEMS,"High as that peak in Heaven where Milton kneels,"
409,OTHER POEMS,Deep as that grave in Hell where Cæsar lies.
410,OTHER POEMS,
411,OTHER POEMS,Still hope for man: my star is on the way!
412,OTHER POEMS,Great Hugo saw it from his prison isle;
413,OTHER POEMS,It lit the mighty dream of Lamennais;
414,OTHER POEMS,It led the ocean thunders of Carlyle.
415,OTHER POEMS,
416,OTHER POEMS,"Wise Greeley saw the star of my desire,"
417,OTHER POEMS,Wise Lincoln knelt before my hidden flame:
418,OTHER POEMS,It was from me they drew their sacred fire—
419,OTHER POEMS,I am Religion by her deeper name.

426,OTHER POEMS,
427,OTHER POEMS,"A blossoming bough against the sky,"
428,OTHER POEMS,"And all my blood is aleap with life,"
429,OTHER POEMS,As though glad violins went by
430,OTHER POEMS,In wild delicious strife!
431,OTHER POEMS,
432,OTHER POEMS,And the Suisun Hills again are green!
433,OTHER POEMS,"And I am a boy in the canyons deep,"
434,OTHER POEMS,"Where the gray sycamores flicker and lean,"
435,OTHER POEMS,And waters plunge and sleep.
436,OTHER POEMS,
437,OTHER POEMS,"A light, quick wind blows into my heart,"
438,OTHER POEMS,Faint with the breath of apple trees;
439,OTHER POEMS,And my lyric lark is back with a start—

456,OTHER POEMS,Sweet one!
457,OTHER POEMS,Whose was the wild hand
458,OTHER POEMS,"Shaped you in child-land,"
459,OTHER POEMS,"Framing the flesh with a flash of desire,"
460,OTHER POEMS,Pouring the soul as a fearful fire?
461,OTHER POEMS,

463,OTHER POEMS,Song child!
464,OTHER POEMS,Who can unravel

498,OTHER POEMS,I took the trail: the fields were yet asleep;
499,OTHER POEMS,I saw the last star hurrying to its deep—
500,OTHER POEMS,Saw the shy wood-folk starting from their rest
501,OTHER POEMS,In many a crannied rock and leafy nest.
502,OTHER POEMS,"A bold, tail-flashing squirrel in a fir,"

506,OTHER POEMS,
507,OTHER POEMS,"A flight of hills, and then a deep ravine"
508,OTHER POEMS,Hung with madrono boughs—the quail’s demesne;
509,OTHER POEMS,"A quick turn in the road, a wingèd whir,"
510,OTHER POEMS,"And there he came with fluted whispering,"
511,OTHER POEMS,"The captain of the chaparral, the king,"
512,OTHER POEMS,"With nodding plume, with circumstance and stir,"
513,OTHER POEMS,And step of Carthaginian conqueror!
514,OTHER POEMS,
515,OTHER POEMS,"I climbed the canyon to a river-head,"
516,OTHER POEMS,"And looking backward saw a splendor spread,"
517,OTHER POEMS,"Miles beyond miles, of every kingly hue"
518,OTHER POEMS,And trembling tint the looms of Arras knew—
519,OTHER POEMS,"A flowery pomp as of the dying day,"
520,OTHER POEMS,A splendor where a god might take his way.
521,OTHER POEMS,
522,OTHER POEMS,"And farther on the wide plains under me,"
523,OTHER POEMS,"I watched the light-foot winds of morning go,"
524,OTHER POEMS,"Soft shading over wheat-fields far and free,"
525,OTHER POEMS,To keep their old appointment with the sea.
526,OTHER POEMS,"And farther yet, dim in the distant glow,"
527,OTHER POEMS,Hung on the east a line of ghostly snow.
528,OTHER POEMS,
529,OTHER POEMS,After the many trails an open space
530,OTHER POEMS,Walled by the tulès of a perished lake;
531,OTHER POEMS,"And there I stretched out, bending the green brake,"
532,OTHER POEMS,And felt it cool against my heated face.
533,OTHER POEMS,"My horse went cropping by a sunny crag,"
534,OTHER POEMS,In wild oats taller than the antlered stag
535,OTHER POEMS,That makes his pasture there. In gorge below
536,OTHER POEMS,"Blind waters pounded boulders, blow on blow—"
537,OTHER POEMS,"Waters that gather, scatter and amass"
538,OTHER POEMS,"Down the long canyons where the grizzlies pass,"
539,OTHER POEMS,"Slouching through manzanita thickets old,"
540,OTHER POEMS,"Strewing the small red apples on the ground,"
541,OTHER POEMS,"Tearing the wild grape from its tree-top hold,"

547,OTHER POEMS,"The faint quick tenor of a brazen bell,"
548,OTHER POEMS,"A sudden, soft, hill-stilled, far-falling word,"
549,OTHER POEMS,That told the secret of the straying herd.
550,OTHER POEMS,
551,OTHER POEMS,"It was the brink of night, and everywhere"
552,OTHER POEMS,Tall redwoods spread their filmy tops in air;
553,OTHER POEMS,"Huge trunks, like shadows upon shadow cast,"
554,OTHER POEMS,"Pillared the under twilight, vague and vast."
555,OTHER POEMS,"And one had fallen across the mountain way,"
556,OTHER POEMS,A tree hurled down by hurricane to lie
557,OTHER POEMS,With torn-out roots pronged-up against the sky
558,OTHER POEMS,And clutching still their little dole of clay.
559,OTHER POEMS,

804,III,Which Was Dream?
805,III,
806,III,_Suggested by an ancient Chinese classic_
807,III,
808,III,
809,III,I thought that I dreamed a dream one night—
810,III,"That I was a moth on a joyous flight,"
811,III,"Under a sky the west wind cools,"
812,III,Over a sky of fields and pools.
813,III,"Like a tinted leaf in the wind content,"
814,III,Over a wonderful world I went:
815,III,Over a valley with wavering wing
816,III,My shadow flew like a startled thing.
817,III,"On through the waters spread below,"
818,III,I saw my delicate phantom go—
819,III,"On, till a flash, and that bright world broke,"
820,III,And I was a man at a sudden stroke!
821,III,
822,III,And now a wonder is on my heart
823,III,Of that world that went at a sudden start—
824,III,"Of this world that came at a stroke of hand,"
825,III,Hung under stars at some high command!
826,III,For now I never can surely know
827,III,Whether in deed or in dream I go;
828,III,Whether I was in that other sky
829,III,Only a dream-moth straying by;
830,III,Or whether _that_ world was the world of truth
831,III,And _this_ one only a dream forsooth;
832,III,Whether perchance for a little span
833,III,A moth is not dreaming itself a man!

838,III,Our Deathless Dead
839,III,
840,III,
841,III,"How shall we honor them, our Deathless Dead?"
842,III,With strew of laurel and the stately tread?
843,III,With blaze of banners brightening overhead?
844,III,"Nay, not alone these cheaper praises bring:"
845,III,They will not have this easy honoring.
846,III,
847,III,"Not all our cannon, breaking the blue noon,"
848,III,"Not the rare reliquary, writ with rune,"
849,III,"Not all the iterance of our reverent cheers,"
850,III,"Not all sad bugles blown,"
851,III,Can honor them grown saintlier with the years.
852,III,Nor can we praise alone
853,III,In the majestic reticence of stone:
854,III,Not even our lyric tears
855,III,"Can honor them, passed upward to their spheres."
856,III,"Nay, we must meet our august hour of fate"
857,III,"As they met theirs; and this will consecrate,"
858,III,"This honor them, this stir their souls afar,"
859,III,Where they are climbing to an ampler star.
860,III,
861,III,"The soaring pillar and the epic boast,"
862,III,The flaring pageant and the storied pile
863,III,"May parley with Oblivion awhile,"
864,III,To save some Sargon of the fading host;
865,III,But these are vain to hold
866,III,"Against the slow creep of the patient mold,"
867,III,The noiseless drill of the erasing rust:
868,III,"The pomp, the arch, the scroll cannot beguile"
869,III,The ever-circling Destinies that must
870,III,Mix king and clown into one rabble dust.
871,III,
872,III,No name of mortal is secure in stone:
873,III,"Hewn on the Parthenon, the name will waste;"
874,III,"Carved on the Pyramid, ‘twill be effaced."
875,III,"In the heroic deed and there alone,"
876,III,"Is man’s one hold against the craft of Time,"
877,III,That humbles into dust the shaft sublime—
878,III,"That mixes sculptured Karnak with the sands,"
879,III,"unannealed, blown about the Libyan lands."
880,III,"And for the high, heroic deeds of men,"
881,III,There is no crown of praise but deed again.
882,III,"Only the heart-quick praise, the praise of deed,"
883,III,Is faithful praise for the heroic breed.
884,III,
885,III,"How shall we honor them, our Deathless Dead?"
886,III,How keep their mighty memories alive?
887,III,"In him who feels their passion, they survive!"
888,III,"Flatter their souls with deed, and all is said!"
889,III,In the heroic soul their souls create
890,III,Is raised remembrance past the reach of fate.
891,III,"The will to serve and bear,"
892,III,"The will to love and dare,"
893,III,And take for God unprofitable risk—
894,III,"These things, these things will utter praise and pæan"
895,III,Louder than lyric thunders Æschylean;
896,III,These things will build our dead unwasting obelisk.

902,III,
903,III,
904,III,"I dwell near a murmur of leaves,"
905,III,And my labor is sweeter than rest;
906,III,For over my head in the shade of the eaves
907,III,A throstle is building his nest.
908,III,
909,III,"And he teaches me gospels of joy,"
910,III,As he gurgles and shouts in his toil:
911,III,"It is brimming with rapture, his wild employ,"
912,III,Bearing a straw for spoil.
913,III,
914,III,So I know ‘twas a joyous God
915,III,"Who stretched out the splendor of things,"
916,III,"And gave to my bird the cool green sod,"
917,III,"A sky, and a venture of wings."
918,III,
919,III,But why are my brothers so still?
920,III,They are building a lordly hall—

929,III,_Suggested by Millet’s painting with this title_
930,III,
931,III,
932,III,Far through the lilac sky the Angelus bell
933,III,Brings back again the hail of Gabriel.
934,III,"Its refluent, three-fold, immemorial rhyme"
935,III,"Follows the fading sun, from clime to clime—"
936,III,"Ripples and lives a moment in the heart,"
937,III,Wherever the dark hours come and the bright depart.
938,III,"From land to fading land, the whole world round,"
939,III,"It airily runs, a rosary of sound—"
940,III,Bursts silverly on sainted Palestine;
941,III,Lives for a moment on the Apennine;
942,III,Flings on the fields of France a far refrain;
943,III,Sends a sweet trouble on the bells of Spain;
944,III,Touches Manhattan; hurries on to be
945,III,A murmur on Saint Francis by the sea.
946,III,
947,III,"But dreamily here the hours of evening go,"
948,III,With tented haycocks in the rosy glow—
949,III,"Gray heaps that Homer saw in ages gone,"
950,III,Sweet-smelling heaps that Abel rested on.
951,III,"And two have heard the summons on the air,"
952,III,"And turned from labor, the embodied prayer;"
953,III,"Bowed with the fine humility of trees,"
954,III,Of bended barley in the quiet breeze;
955,III,As faithful as the never-failing Earth
956,III,That gives us bread of rest and bread of mirth;
957,III,As patient as the rocks that have been still
958,III,Since put into their places on the hill;
959,III,"In league with Earth and all her quiet things,"
960,III,Whose lives are wrapped in shade and whisperings;
961,III,In league with Earth and all the things that live
962,III,To give their toil for others and forgive.
963,III,
964,III,Pausing to let the hush of evening pass
965,III,"Across the soul, as shadow over grass,"
966,III,"They cease their day-long sacrament of toil,"
967,III,"That living prayer, the tilling of the soil!"
968,III,And richer are their two-fold worshippings
969,III,Than flare of pontiff or the pomp of kings.
970,III,"For each true deed is worship: it is prayer,"
971,III,And carries its own answer unaware.
972,III,"Yes, they whose feet upon good errands run"
973,III,"Are friends of God, with Michael of the sun;"
974,III,"Yes, each accomplished service of the day"
975,III,Paves for the feet of God a lordlier way.
976,III,"The souls that love and labor through all wrong,"
977,III,They clasp His hand and make the circle strong;
978,III,"They lay the deep foundation, stone by stone,"
979,III,And build into Eternity God’s throne!
980,III,
981,III,He is more pleased by some sweet human use
982,III,Than by the learnèd book of the recluse;
983,III,Sweeter are comrade kindnesses to Him
984,III,Than the high harpings of the Seraphim;
985,III,More than white incense circling to the dome
986,III,Is a field well furrowed or a nail sent home.
987,III,More than the hallelujahs of the choirs
988,III,"Or hushed adorings at the altar fires,"
989,III,Is a loaf well kneaded or a room swept clean

1015,III,

1017,III,And I rose up to follow after them.
1018,III,He led toward Bethany by the narrow bridge
1019,III,"Of Kedron, upward to the olive ridge."
1020,III,"Once on the camel path beyond the City,"
1021,III,"He looked back, struck at heart with pain and pity—"
1022,III,Looked backward from the two lone cedar trees
1023,III,"On Olivet, alive to every breeze—"
1024,III,"Looked in a rush of sudden tears, and then"
1025,III,"Went steadily on, never to turn again."
1026,III,
1027,III,Near the green quiets of a little wood
1028,III,The Master halted silently and stood.
1029,III,"The figs were purpling, and a fledgling dove"
1030,III,"Had fallen from a windy bough above,"
1031,III,"And lay there crying feebly by a thorn,"
1032,III,Its little body bruisèd and forlorn.
1033,III,He stept aside a moment from the rest
1034,III,And put it safely back into the nest.
1035,III,
1036,III,Then mighty words did seem to rise in Him
1037,III,And die away: even as white vapors swim
1038,III,"A moment on Mount Carmel’s purple steep,"
1039,III,And then are blown back rainless to the deep.
1040,III,And once He looked up with a little start:
1041,III,"Perhaps some loved name passed across His heart,"
1042,III,"Some memory of a road in Galilee,"
1043,III,Or old familiar rock beside the Sea.
1044,III,
1045,III,And suddenly there broke upon our sight
1046,III,A rush of angels terrible with light—
1047,III,"The high same host the Shepherds saw go by,"
1048,III,Breaking the starry night with lyric cry—
1049,III,"A rush of angels, wistful and aware,"
1050,III,That shook a thousand colors on the air—
1051,III,Colors that made a music to the eye—
1052,III,"Glories of lilac, azure, gold, vermilion,"
1053,III,Blown from the air-hung delicate pavilion.
1054,III,
1055,III,And now His face grew bright with luminous will:
1056,III,The great grave eyes grew planet-like and still.
1057,III,"Yea, in that moment all His face fire-white"
1058,III,Seemed struck out of imperishable light.
1059,III,"Delicious apprehension shook the spirit,"
1060,III,With song so still that only the heart could hear it.
1061,III,"A sense of something sacred, starry, vast,"
1062,III,"Greater than Earth, across the being passed."
1063,III,
1064,III,"Then with a stretching of His hands to bless,"
1065,III,"A last unspeakable look that was caress,"
1066,III,Up through the vortice of bright cherubim
1067,III,He rose until the august form grew dim—
1068,III,"Up through the blue dome of the day ascended,"
1069,III,By circling flights of seraphim befriended.
1070,III,"He was uplifted from us, and was gone"

1099,III,There each one has a goodly space—

1107,III,With equal nearness to His store.
1108,III,
1109,III,"And trees, they have no private ends,"

1111,III,"They send their beauty on all things,"

1121,III,Takes what its lifted arms can hold

1123,III,And all give back with pleasure high

1954,II,My elf child glimmers and goes;
1955,II,As glad as a throstle
1956,II,Whose tremolos jostle
1957,II,The rain on the leaf of a rose.
1958,II,
1959,II,"He comes in a twinkling,"
1960,II,With never an inkling
1961,II,That law is not one with his word;
1962,II,"But gives me good wages,"
1963,II,The penny of ages—
1964,II,Love wild as the heart of a bird.
1965,II,
1966,II,"He laughs down my quiet,"
1967,II,"This lord of the riot,"
1968,II,This Prince of the Kingdom of Whim;
1969,II,"The world is his castle,"
1970,II,And I am his vassal
1971,II,To trumpet the triumphs of him!

1980,II,Lightly behind him the blackbirds follow—
1981,II,By quick little journeys they follow and whistle.
1982,II,Now a gossamer ship breaks away to the blue
1983,II,(Who stands by the railing and waves adieu?)
1984,II,All night it was moored to a thistle.
1985,II,
1986,II,Who knows the glad business afoot on the by-way?

1995,II,Into the song of the Poet are builded the things that endure:
1996,II,The Pillars of Karnak will crumble but the song of Shelley is sure.
1997,II,
1998,II,"It will hold through the ages of ages, like the heavens steadied in air:"
1999,II,The hoofs that trample the kingdoms down that miracle must spare.

2004,II,The God of Song and Mirth
2005,II,
2006,II,
2007,II,‘Twas the God of Song and Mirth
2008,II,Who descended to the Earth.
2009,II,It was He who veiled His face
2010,II,In the sorrow of the race;
2011,II,"He who toiled at Nazareth,"
2012,II,Going with us down to death;
2013,II,"He who bowed the heavens for men,"
2014,II,And arose to light again.
2015,II,
2016,II,‘Twas the First-born Son of Light
2017,II,"Shone upon the human night,"
2018,II,Bringing down the Final Truth
2019,II,"In His deep, eternal youth."
2020,II,God was reconciled to man
2021,II,When the ages first began;
2022,II,But that man be reconciled
2023,II,God became a little child.
2024,II,
2025,II,So appeared the God of Song
2026,II,In the planet going wrong;
2027,II,"So appeared the God of Light,"
2028,II,God of Passion still and white;
2029,II,Came to help us lift the weight
2030,II,Of the planetary fate;
2031,II,Came and taught the one relief
2032,II,For the gray primeval grief—
2033,II,"Taught that Love, though deified,"
2034,II,Could not set the Law aside.

2040,II,
2041,II,
2042,II,"I think of that friend of the people that lady of long ago,"
2043,II,That high-born dame of Hungary who felt the common woe—
2044,II,"Who loved the work-worn multitude whose pillow is a stone,"
2045,II,And felt beat in upon her heart their sorrow as her own.
2046,II,"She bent to lift, for in her blood ran some heroic strain"
2047,II,Of simple serving majesty strayed down from Charlemagne.
2048,II,"Queen of a hundred legends, star of a misty past,"
2049,II,"While cities rise and cities fade, her memory will last."
2050,II,
2051,II,"It was upon a Christmas eve, and all the world was white"
2052,II,With snow that sent an awesome hush on hollow and on height;
2053,II,
2054,II,"And green boughs bended with hoar weight, and under them the birds"
2055,II,"Huddled together, making friends with little hornèd herds."
2056,II,"And far from soundless gorges in the soundless forest deep,"
2057,II,The wild boar humped up closer in the hollow of his heap;
2058,II,"And workers huddled in their huts among the stiffened trees,"
2059,II,"The doorstones blue with ice, the eaves with frosty filigrees."
2060,II,
2061,II,"And Horsel’s peak hung ghostly still upon the wintry sky,"
2062,II,"But Wartburg’s castle-hall was filled with many a joyous cry,"
2063,II,"With hurrying feet and merry fleer of scullion, churl, and maid,"
2064,II,
2065,II,For now within a happy hour the banquet must be laid.
2066,II,"Pert pages in their purfled shoes went twinkling in and out,"
2067,II,And from the towers came snatch of song and many a ruddy shout.
2068,II,"Elizabeth was there above, among her maiden band,"
2069,II,Spinning the new-cut wool to warm the naked of her land.
2070,II,"(O serving queen, I honor thee—queen of a day gone down,"
2071,II,Who carried dimly in thy heart the meaning of the crown!)
2072,II,
2073,II,"And now the steward gave a sign, and on the frosty moats"
2074,II,The sceptered heralds blew again their crisp and crinkling notes.
2075,II,There fell a momentary hush upon the corridors;
2076,II,
2077,II,"Then stir of feet, then whisper of silk gowns across the floors"
2078,II,Came onward like the tumult of white barley in the breeze;
2079,II,"Then young Elizabeth the Moon, leading her Pleiades!"
2080,II,"Their robes were shot with thread of gold that into blossom broke,"
2081,II,And jewels darkling in their hair at every motion woke—
2082,II,
2083,II,"Yolinda, Bertrade, Thekla, Brune, Bertilla, Hildegarde,"
2084,II,"And Kinga, tallest of the seven, and by her side the bard,"
2085,II,"Gray Vogelweide, the lyric swan, telling with flash of youth,"
2086,II,How once he stood against the world for Hungary and truth—
2087,II,
2088,II,"How singing in this knightly hall, circled by courtly throng,"
2089,II,He fought the star of Austria in Wartburg’s War of Song.
2090,II,
2091,II,Then the young sovereign Lewis and his guests swept glowing in—
2092,II,"Lord, liegeman, shaggy baron, gallant knight and paladin,"
2093,II,Each with a winsome lady and a wreath of storied days:
2094,II,Dark Rudolph home from Holy War with Lion Richard’s praise;
2095,II,"Walter the Falconer, and Franz, the flower of Hesse’s men,"
2096,II,Who brought Elizabeth a sword torn from a Saracen;
2097,II,"Hellgraf with jewelled glove agleam high in his helmet’s hold,"
2098,II,
2099,II,A glove she gave a beggar once and he bought back with gold.
2100,II,"And so the throng came eddying in, and with the splendor went"
2101,II,Ripple of silver laughter and of whispered compliment.
2102,II,
2103,II,"The torches flamed and faltered, sending up white whirls of smoke,"
2104,II,To hang as twilight in the roof raftered with crookèd oak.
2105,II,Up from the chimney log the notes of many woodlands sang;
2106,II,Quick through the flame the colors of a hundred summers sprang.
2107,II,"The blaze threw on the arrased wall a gush of golden light,"
2108,II,"Where hung Saint Stephen’s shield between two angels in still flight,"
2109,II,
2110,II,"Forever moving upward toward the cherubs overhead,"
2111,II,Now sinking into shade and now breaking to rosy red.
2112,II,
2113,II,"A swinging door, a spicy smell, and beaming Hugolin"
2114,II,With smoking boar’s head lifted high came proudly panting in.
2115,II,And as the sparkling feast went on the board began to stir
2116,II,"With talk of knightly valor and the Holy Sepulchre,"
2117,II,With prattle of the tidings from Jerusalem and Rome;
2118,II,"But sweet Elizabeth, her thoughts were not so far from home."
2119,II,"In spite of rosy radiance, in spite of trumpet calls,"
2120,II,The Sorrow of the People sent its shadow through the walls.
2121,II,
2122,II,
2123,II,For sitting there beside her lord a sudden silence came
2124,II,"Upon her soul, and all the voices and the horn’s acclaim"
2125,II,"Died; and the glowing pageant broke and faded into air,"
2126,II,And only the faces of the poor whose tables are so bare
2127,II,"Pressed in upon her soul that night, pressed in that gala night;"
2128,II,Only the toilers’ cheerless homes rose on her inward sight.
2129,II,
2130,II,And then a graver thought let in a darkness on her heart—
2131,II,A thought of all the feasts they spread of which they have no part—
2132,II,"A thought, too, of this splendor on this holy Christmas eve,"
2133,II,
2134,II,A splendor wrung from toiling hands by those that tax and thieve.
2135,II,Of all those fragrant dishes only two would not profane;
2136,II,Only the bread and water there had come of honest gain;
2137,II,These only were not pilfered from the toiler’s lean supply;
2138,II,"And these she took with happy hands, but let the rest go by."
2139,II,
2140,II,"And so the table roared away into the winter night,"
2141,II,Until the toasts went round the board with laughter at the height.
2142,II,"They drank to saints and prophets old, to Peter and Isadore,"
2143,II,"To Stephen, Vincent, Boniface, and to a dozen more."
2144,II,Then valiant Wolfram in his turn upstarted with a cry:
2145,II,
2146,II,"“Drink to Archangel Michael, that good fighter in the sky,"
2147,II,That prince of God that all the hosts of Satan could not tame!”
2148,II,Up to their feet the feasters sprang at that great angel’s name.
2149,II,"Clinking their cups from side to side, they made, in the torches’ flare,"
2150,II,The sign of the cross with their jewelled cups high flashing in the air.
2151,II,
2152,II,Now cried the duke: “Not all the saints have felt the wind of death;
2153,II,"Come, drink to one who walks the Earth, my wife Elizabeth;"
2154,II,And I will pledge her beauty with this water in her cup.”
2155,II,"So stooping down he caught and swung her golden goblet up,"
2156,II,
2157,II,"And tasted—paused—tasted again, for lo, it was rare wine!"
2158,II,More strangely sweet than any juice pressed from an earthly vine.
2159,II,"“Ho, varlet, from what pipe this wine and from what cellar shelf?”"
2160,II,"“From good Saint Kilian’s well, sire, and I drew it up myself!”"
2161,II,"She flushed; the table stared; the duke looked foolishly about,"
2162,II,The hall so still they heard far bells breaking the night without.
2163,II,
2164,II,Then up spake Helias the Seer: “I saw the water poured—
2165,II,"Saw, too, an angel bending by our lady at the board,"
2166,II,"Pouring with courteous gesture from a flagon of red wine,"
2167,II,
2168,II,Then fading in the brightness of the firelight’s dancing shine.”
2169,II,She heard in glad amaze: he wins God’s favor unawares
2170,II,"Who, self-forgot in brother love, a brother’s burden bears."
2171,II,
2172,II,*       *       *       *       *
2173,II,
2174,II,And this seven centuries ago. And now her sainted feet
2175,II,"Are on the fields of Paradise, making its old paths sweet."
2176,II,"And there she has her fill of love where the Friendly City is,"
2177,II,Her warm hands white with labor in God’s busy palaces.

2199,II,"Youth answered, “I am blind and I would see;"
2200,II,Open my eyes and let me look on thee.”
2201,II,"‘Twas done: he saw the face of Life, and then"

2212,II,What boy with his face to the Ægean Sea
2213,II,"Went threading his way over mountain and plain,"
2214,II,With a spirit as glad as a blossoming tree?
2215,II,"It was Bacchus, now pure as the wild white rain,"
2216,II,"But soon to be worshiped by mortals, with passion and sorrow and pain."
2217,II,
2218,II,"He had found a vine on the forest ways,"
2219,II,And a skeleton bird in a rocky pass
2220,II,To shelter the leaf from the sunny rays;
2221,II,"But it grew till he sheltered them both, alas,"
2222,II,"In the hollow skull of a lion, and then in the skull of an ass!"
2223,II,
2224,II,"As he lay at noon in a mossy rest,"
2225,II,The vine had shot up all a-tremble with light.
2226,II,Now he bears it home—(O the doom unguessed!)
2227,II,
2228,II,"On, on, while the hills swing away out of sight—"
2229,II,"Till the misty far mountains rise dimly, and pass in a silent flight."
2230,II,
2231,II,"At last when his garden was furrowed, he found"
2232,II,That the bones were all twined by the lusty root;
2233,II,"So he planted the whole in the deep-stirred ground,"
2234,II,"And lightly danced to his Lydian flute,"
2235,II,While the leafy depths of the eerie vine purpled with clustering fruit.
2236,II,
2237,II,Then he made him wine—for it was the grape—
2238,II,"And darkened its depths with a perilous spell,"
2239,II,"And gave it to man with the angel shape,"
2240,II,When lo! a wonder and terror befell—
2241,II,Was it a wonder from Heaven—was it a terror from Hell?
2242,II,
2243,II,
2244,II,For he drinks—and he carols and sings like a bird!
2245,II,"And drinking again of the magical glass,"
2246,II,He is proud as a lion when passion-stirred!
2247,II,"But drinking once more of the liquor, alas,"
2248,II,"He loses the shape of the angel, and takes on the shape of an ass!"

2257,II,"Swirled round me, ash of pearl and amethyst,"
2258,II,"How, in an unknown, difficult, high place,"
2259,II,"I pushed the green boughs backward from my face,"
2260,II,"And with a fire along the blood, a cry,"
2261,II,Rode out upon a headland in the sky.
2262,II,
2263,II,I know not in what world it was—Mirak
2264,II,"Or Algol, or some further Zodiac!"
2265,II,I looked down on a sea of fog below;
2266,II,"Saw strange lands rise, strange waters furl and flow,"
2267,II,Breaking on newly lifted reefs and shores—
2268,II,"New Africas, new Indies, new Azores—"
2269,II,"Lands that allured me to illustrious deed,"
2270,II,"Past Roland’s fame, and all his knightly breed—"
2271,II,"Fringes of lands no foot had ever found,"
2272,II,Where billows climbed and burst without a sound;

2284,II,"To him the wonder never dies,"
2285,II,For youth is looking through his eyes.
2286,II,"Pale listener at the heart of things,"
2287,II,He hears the voices and the wings:
2288,II,He hears the skylark overhead—
2289,II,Hears the far footfalls of the dead.
2290,II,
2291,II,"When the swift Muses seize their child,"
2292,II,Then God has gladness rich and wild;
2293,II,"For when the bard is caught and hurled,"
2294,II,A splendor breaks across the world.
2295,II,His song distils a saving power
2296,II,"From foot-worn stone, from wayside flower."
2297,II,
2298,II,"He knows the gospel of the trees,"
2299,II,The whispered message of the seas;
2300,II,Finds in some beetle on the road
2301,II,A power to lift the human load;
2302,II,"Sees, in some dead leaf dried and curled,"
2303,II,The deeper meaning of the world;
2304,II,Hears through the roar of mortal things
2305,II,The God’s immortal whisperings;
2306,II,"Sees the world-wonder rise and fall,"
2307,II,And knows that Beauty made it all.
2308,II,
2309,II,"He walks the circle of the sun,"
2310,II,And sees the bright Powers laugh and run.
2311,II,"He feels the motion of the sphere,"
2312,II,And builds his song in sacred fear.
2313,II,He finds the faithful witness hid
2314,II,In poppy-head and Pyramid.
2315,II,The Golden Heaven or the Pit—
2316,II,He shakes the music out of it.
2317,II,All things yield up their souls to him

2325,II,
2326,II,"Friar Hilary, of Barbizon,"
2327,II,(Rest to his soul where his soul has gone!)
2328,II,Was a man whose life was long perplexed
2329,II,By pious juggles with the text.
2330,II,The logic of St. Thomas’ books
2331,II,Was fastened to his mind with hooks.
2332,II,He knew Tertullian’s work complete—
2333,II,That treatise on the Paraclete.
2334,II,He knew the words Chrysostom hurled
2335,II,In golden thunder on the world;
2336,II,And he could commentate and quote
2337,II,The thirteen books Saint Cyril wrote.
2338,II,"The controversies of Jerome,"
2339,II,"He could recite them, tome by tome."
2340,II,
2341,II,"The friar was tall and spare and spent,"
2342,II,Like a cedar of Lebanon bare and bent.
2343,II,"His eyes were sunken and burned too bright,"
2344,II,Like restless stars in the pit of night.
2345,II,
2346,II,"The friar had built a tower of stone,"
2347,II,And dwelt far up in a cell alone;
2348,II,"And from the turret, gray in air,"
2349,II,"He called to God with psalm and prayer,"
2350,II,To come as he did to the wise of old—
2351,II,To come as the ancient voice foretold.
2352,II,All day the hawk swung overhead;
2353,II,All day the holy page was read.
2354,II,
2355,II,"One bleak December he fasted sore,"
2356,II,That Christ might knock at his low door—
2357,II,Lord Jesus shine across the floor.
2358,II,For he was hungry to be fed
2359,II,"With the holy love, with the mystic bread."
2360,II,"Yet Christ came not to sup with him,"
2361,II,And Christmas Eve fell chilly and dim.
2362,II,"“Where art Thou?” he would cry and hark,"
2363,II,While echoes answered in the dark....
2364,II,"Where was the Lord—was he afar,"
2365,II,Throned calmly on the central star?
2366,II,
2367,II,Now suddenly there came a cry
2368,II,As of a mortal like to die.
2369,II,"Up sprang the friar, the doors of oak"
2370,II,He flung asunder at a stroke.
2371,II,"Down stair by stair his quick feet flew,"
2372,II,"Startling the owls that the rafters knew,"
2373,II,"Breaking the webs that barred the way,"
2374,II,Crushing the mosses that fear the day.
2375,II,Into the pitiless street he ran
2376,II,"To find a stricken fellow-man,"
2377,II,"And carry him in upon his breast,"
2378,II,With many a halt on the stairs for rest.
2379,II,
2380,II,"He washed the feet and stroked the hair,"
2381,II,And for the once forgot his prayer.
2382,II,He gave him wine that the Pope had sent
2383,II,For some great day of the Sacrament;
2384,II,"And looking up, behold, at his side"
2385,II,Was bending also the Crucified!
2386,II,"He had come at last to the lonesome place,"
2387,II,"And standing there with a courteous grace,"
2388,II,Threw sainted light on the friar’s face.
2389,II,
2390,II,"And then the Master said: “My son,"
2391,II,My children on my errands run;
2392,II,And when you flung the psalter by
2393,II,"And hurried to a brother’s cry,"
2394,II,"You turned at last your rusty key,"
2395,II,And left the door ajar for Me.”
