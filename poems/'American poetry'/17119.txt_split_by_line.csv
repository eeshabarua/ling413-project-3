147,ELMWOOD.,
148,ELMWOOD.,
149,ELMWOOD.,"About half a mile from the Craigie House in Cambridge, Massachusetts,"
150,ELMWOOD.,"on the road leading to the old town of Watertown, is Elmwood, a"
151,ELMWOOD.,"spacious square house set amongst lilac and syringa bushes, and"
152,ELMWOOD.,"overtopped by elms. Pleasant fields are on either side, and from the"
153,ELMWOOD.,windows one may look out on the Charles River winding its way among
154,ELMWOOD.,the marshes. The house itself is one of a group which before the war
155,ELMWOOD.,for independence belonged to Boston merchants and officers of the
156,ELMWOOD.,crown who refused to take the side of the revolutionary party. Tory
157,ELMWOOD.,Row was the name given to the broad winding road on which the houses
158,ELMWOOD.,"stood. Great farms and gardens were attached to them, and some sign of"
159,ELMWOOD.,their roomy ease still remains. The estates fell into the hands of
160,ELMWOOD.,"various persons after the war, and in process of time Longfellow came"
161,ELMWOOD.,to occupy Craigie House. Elmwood at that time was the property of the
162,ELMWOOD.,"Reverend Charles Lowell, minister of the West Church in Boston, and"
163,ELMWOOD.,"when Longfellow thus became his neighbor, James Russell Lowell was a"
164,ELMWOOD.,"junior in Harvard College. He was born at Elmwood, February 22, 1819."
165,ELMWOOD.,Any one who will read _An Indian Summer Reverie_ will discover how
166,ELMWOOD.,affectionately Lowell dwelt on the scenes of nature and life amidst
167,ELMWOOD.,"which he grew up. Indeed, it would be a pleasant task to draw from the"
168,ELMWOOD.,full storehouse of his poetry the golden phrases with which he
169,ELMWOOD.,"characterizes the trees, meadows, brooks, flowers, birds, and human"
170,ELMWOOD.,companions that were so near to him in his youth and so vivid in his
171,ELMWOOD.,"recollection. In his prose works also a lively paper, _Cambridge"
172,ELMWOOD.,"Thirty Years Ago_, contains many reminiscences of his early life."
173,ELMWOOD.,
174,ELMWOOD.,"To know any one well it is needful to inquire into his ancestry, and"
175,ELMWOOD.,two or three hints may be given of the currents that met in this poet.
176,ELMWOOD.,On his father's side he came from a succession of New England men who
177,ELMWOOD.,for the previous three generations had been in professional life. The
178,ELMWOOD.,"Lowells traced their descent from Percival Lowell,--a name which"
179,ELMWOOD.,"survives in the family,--of Bristol, England, who settled in Newbury,"
180,ELMWOOD.,"Massachusetts, in 1639. The great-grandfather was a minister in"
181,ELMWOOD.,"Newburyport, one of those, as Dr. Hale says, ""who preached sermons"
182,ELMWOOD.,"when young men went out to fight the French, and preached sermons"
183,ELMWOOD.,"again in memory of their death when they had been slain in battle."""
184,ELMWOOD.,"The grandfather was John Lowell, a member of the Constitutional"
185,ELMWOOD.,Convention of Massachusetts in 1780. It was he who introduced into the
186,ELMWOOD.,"Bill of Rights a phrase from the Bill of Rights of Virginia, ""All men"
187,ELMWOOD.,"are created free and equal,"" with the purpose which it effected of"
188,ELMWOOD.,setting free every man then held as a slave in Massachusetts. A son of
189,ELMWOOD.,John Lowell and brother of the Rev. Charles Lowell was Francis Cabot
190,ELMWOOD.,"Lowell, who gave a great impetus to New England manufactures, and from"
191,ELMWOOD.,"whom the city of Lowell took its name. Another son, and thus also an"
192,ELMWOOD.,"uncle of the poet, was John Lowell, Jr., whose wise and far-sighted"
193,ELMWOOD.,provision gave to Boston that powerful centre of intellectual
194,ELMWOOD.,"influence, the Lowell Institute. Of the Rev. Charles Lowell, his son"
195,ELMWOOD.,"said, in a letter written in 1844, ""He is Doctor Primrose in the"
196,ELMWOOD.,"comparative degree, the very simplest and charmingest of"
197,ELMWOOD.,"sexagenarians, and not without a great deal of the truest"
198,ELMWOOD.,"magnanimity."" It was characteristic of Lowell thus to go to _The Vicar"
199,ELMWOOD.,of Wakefield_ for a portrait of his father. Dr. Lowell lived till
200,ELMWOOD.,"1861, when his son was forty-two."
201,ELMWOOD.,
202,ELMWOOD.,"[Illustration: Elmwood, Mr. Lowell's home in Cambridge.]"
203,ELMWOOD.,
204,ELMWOOD.,"Mrs. Harriet Spence Lowell, the poet's mother, was of Scotch origin, a"
205,ELMWOOD.,"native of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She is described as having ""a"
206,ELMWOOD.,"great memory, an extraordinary aptitude for language, and a passionate"
207,ELMWOOD.,"fondness for ancient songs and ballads."" It pleased her to fancy"
208,ELMWOOD.,"herself descended from the hero of one of the most famous ballads, Sir"
209,ELMWOOD.,"Patrick Spens, and at any rate she made a genuine link in the Poetic"
210,ELMWOOD.,"Succession. In a letter to his mother, written in 1837, Lowell says:"
211,ELMWOOD.,"""I am engaged in several poetical effusions, one of which I have"
212,ELMWOOD.,"dedicated to you, who have always been the patron and encourager of my"
213,ELMWOOD.,"youthful muse."" The Russell in his name seems to intimate a strain of"
214,ELMWOOD.,Jewish ancestry; at any rate Lowell took pride in the name on this
215,ELMWOOD.,"account, for he was not slow to recognize the intellectual power of"
216,ELMWOOD.,"the Hebrew race. He was the youngest of a family of five, two"
217,ELMWOOD.,daughters and three sons. An older brother who outlived him a short
218,ELMWOOD.,"time, was the Rev. Robert Traill Spence Lowell, who wrote besides a"
219,ELMWOOD.,"novel, _The New Priest in Conception Bay_, which contains a delightful"
220,ELMWOOD.,"study of a Yankee, some poems, and a story of school-boy life."
221,ELMWOOD.,
222,ELMWOOD.,"Not long before his death, Lowell wrote to an English friend a"
223,ELMWOOD.,"description of Elmwood, and as he was very fond of the house in which"
224,ELMWOOD.,"he lived and died, it is agreeable to read words which strove to set"
225,ELMWOOD.,"it before the eyes of one who had never seen it. ""'Tis a pleasant old"
226,ELMWOOD.,"house, just about twice as old as I am, four miles from Boston, in"
227,ELMWOOD.,what was once the country and is now a populous suburb. But it still
228,ELMWOOD.,"has some ten acres of open about it, and some fine old trees. When the"
229,ELMWOOD.,worst comes to the worst (if I live so long) I shall still have four
230,ELMWOOD.,"and a half acres left with the house, the rest belonging to my"
231,ELMWOOD.,"brothers and sisters or their heirs. It is a square house, with four"
232,ELMWOOD.,"rooms on a floor, like some houses of the Georgian era I have seen in"
233,ELMWOOD.,"English provincial towns, only they are of brick, and this is of wood."
234,ELMWOOD.,"But it is solid with its heavy oaken beams, the spaces between which"
235,ELMWOOD.,"in the four outer walls are filled in with brick, though you mustn't"
236,ELMWOOD.,"fancy a brick-and-timber house, for outwardly it is sheathed with"
237,ELMWOOD.,wood. Inside there is much wainscot (of deal) painted white in the
238,ELMWOOD.,"fashion of the time when it was built. It is very sunny, the sun"
239,ELMWOOD.,rising so as to shine (at an acute angle to be sure) through the
240,ELMWOOD.,"northern windows, and going round the other three sides in the course"
241,ELMWOOD.,of the day. There is a pretty staircase with the quaint old twisted
242,ELMWOOD.,"banisters,--which they call balusters now; but mine are banisters. My"
243,ELMWOOD.,library occupies two rooms opening into each other by arches at the
244,ELMWOOD.,sides of the ample chimneys. The trees I look out on are the earliest
245,ELMWOOD.,things I remember. There you have me in my new-old quarters. But you
246,ELMWOOD.,"must not fancy a large house--rooms sixteen feet square, and on the"
247,ELMWOOD.,"ground floor, nine high. It was large, as things went here, when it"
248,ELMWOOD.,"was built, and has a certain air of amplitude about it as from some"
249,ELMWOOD.,"inward sense of dignity."" In an earlier letter he wrote: ""Here I am in"
250,ELMWOOD.,"my garret. I slept here when I was a little curly-headed boy, and used"
251,ELMWOOD.,"to see visions between me and the ceiling, and dream the so often"
252,ELMWOOD.,recurring dream of having the earth put into my hand like an orange.
253,ELMWOOD.,"In it I used to be shut up without a lamp,--my mother saying that none"
254,ELMWOOD.,"of her children should be afraid of the dark,--to hide my head under"
255,ELMWOOD.,"the pillow, and then not be able to shut out the shapeless monsters"
256,ELMWOOD.,"that thronged around me, minted in my brain.... In winter my view is a"
257,ELMWOOD.,"wide one, taking in a part of Boston. I can see one long curve of the"
258,ELMWOOD.,"Charles and the wide fields between me and Cambridge, and the flat"
259,ELMWOOD.,"marshes beyond the river, smooth and silent with glittering snow. As"
260,ELMWOOD.,"the spring advances and one after another of our trees puts forth, the"
261,ELMWOOD.,"landscape is cut off from me piece by piece, till, by the end of May,"
262,ELMWOOD.,"I am closeted in a cool and rustling privacy of leaves."" In two of his"
263,ELMWOOD.,"papers especially, _My Garden Acquaintance_ and _A Good Word for"
264,ELMWOOD.,"Winter_, has Lowell given glimpses of the out-door life in the midst"
265,ELMWOOD.,of which he grew up.

275,EDUCATION.,His acquaintance with books and his schooling began early. He learned
276,EDUCATION.,"his letters at a dame school. Mr. William Wells, an Englishman, opened"
277,EDUCATION.,a classical school in one of the spacious Tory Row houses near
278,EDUCATION.,"Elmwood, and, bringing with him English public school thoroughness and"
279,EDUCATION.,"severity, gave the boy a drilling in Latin, which he must have made"
280,EDUCATION.,almost a native speech to judge by the ease with which he handled it
281,EDUCATION.,afterward in mock heroics. Of course he went to Harvard College. He
282,EDUCATION.,"lived at his father's house, more than a mile away from the college"
283,EDUCATION.,"yard; but this could have been no great privation to him, for he had"
284,EDUCATION.,"the freedom of his friends' rooms, and he loved the open air. The Rev."
285,EDUCATION.,Edward Everett Hale has given a sketch of their common life in
286,EDUCATION.,"college. ""He was a little older than I,"" he says, ""and was one class"
287,EDUCATION.,"in advance of me. My older brother, with whom I lived in college, and"
288,EDUCATION.,he were most intimate friends. He had no room within the college
289,EDUCATION.,"walls, and was a great deal with us. The fashion of Cambridge was then"
290,EDUCATION.,"literary. Now the fashion of Cambridge runs to social problems, but"
291,EDUCATION.,then we were interested in literature. We read Byron and Shelley and
292,EDUCATION.,"Keats, and we began to read Tennyson and Browning. I first heard of"
293,EDUCATION.,"Tennyson from Lowell, who had borrowed from Mr. Emerson the little"
294,EDUCATION.,first volume of Tennyson. We actually passed about Tennyson's poems in
295,EDUCATION.,"manuscript. Carlyle's essays were being printed at the time, and his"
296,EDUCATION.,_French Revolution_. In such a community--not two hundred and fifty
297,EDUCATION.,"students all told,--literary effort was, as I say, the fashion, and"
298,EDUCATION.,"literary men, among whom Lowell was recognized from the very first,"
299,EDUCATION.,"were special favorites. Indeed, there was that in him which made him a"
300,EDUCATION.,"favorite everywhere."""
301,EDUCATION.,
302,EDUCATION.,Lowell was but fifteen years old when he entered college in the class
303,EDUCATION.,"which graduated in 1838. He was a reader, as so many of his fellows"
304,EDUCATION.,"were, and the letters which he wrote shortly after leaving college"
305,EDUCATION.,show how intent he had been on making acquaintance with the best
306,EDUCATION.,"things in literature. He began also to scribble verse, and he wrote"
307,EDUCATION.,both poems and essays for college magazines. His class chose him
308,EDUCATION.,"their poet for Class Day, and he wrote his poem; but he was careless"
309,EDUCATION.,about conforming to college regulations respecting attendance at
310,EDUCATION.,morning prayers; and for this was suspended from college the last term
311,EDUCATION.,"of his last year, and not allowed to come back to read his poem. ""I"
312,EDUCATION.,"have heard in later years,"" says Dr. Hale, ""what I did not know then,"
313,EDUCATION.,"that he rode down from Concord in a canvas-covered wagon, and peeped"
314,EDUCATION.,out through the chinks of the wagon to see the dancing around the
315,EDUCATION.,tree. I fancy he received one or two visits from his friends in the
316,EDUCATION.,wagon; but in those times it would have been treason to speak of
317,EDUCATION.,"this."" He was sent to Concord for his rustication, and so passed a few"
318,EDUCATION.,weeks of his youth amongst scenes dear to every lover of American
319,EDUCATION.,letters.

328,FIRST VENTURE.,
329,FIRST VENTURE.,"After his graduation he set about the study of law, and for a short"
330,FIRST VENTURE.,time even was a clerk in a counting-room; but his bent was strongly
331,FIRST VENTURE.,toward literature. There was at that time no magazine of commanding
332,FIRST VENTURE.,"importance in America, and young men were given to starting magazines"
333,FIRST VENTURE.,with enthusiasm and very little other capital. Such a one was the
334,FIRST VENTURE.,"_Boston Miscellany_, launched by Nathan Hale, Lowell's college friend,"
335,FIRST VENTURE.,"and for this Lowell wrote gaily. It lived a year, and shortly after"
336,FIRST VENTURE.,"Lowell himself, with Robert Carter, essayed _The Pioneer_ in 1843. It"
337,FIRST VENTURE.,lived just three months; but in that time printed contributions by
338,FIRST VENTURE.,"Lowell, Hawthorne, Whittier, Story, Poe, and Dr. Parsons,--a group"
339,FIRST VENTURE.,which it would be hard to match in any of the little magazines that
340,FIRST VENTURE.,"hop across the world's path to-day. Lowell had already collected, in"
341,FIRST VENTURE.,"1841, the poems which he had written and sometimes contributed to"
342,FIRST VENTURE.,periodicals into a volume entitled _A Year's Life_; but he retained
343,FIRST VENTURE.,very little of the contents in later editions of his poems. The book
344,FIRST VENTURE.,"has a special interest, however, from its dedication in veiled phrase"
345,FIRST VENTURE.,"to Maria White. He became engaged to this lady in the fall of 1840,"
346,FIRST VENTURE.,and the next twelve years of his life were profoundly affected by her
347,FIRST VENTURE.,"influence. Herself a poet of delicate power, she brought into his life"
348,FIRST VENTURE.,"an intelligent sympathy with his work; it was, however, her strong"
349,FIRST VENTURE.,"moral enthusiasm, her lofty conception of purity and justice, which"
350,FIRST VENTURE.,kindled his spirit and gave force and direction to a character which
351,FIRST VENTURE.,"was ready to respond, and yet might otherwise have delayed active"
352,FIRST VENTURE.,expression. They were not married until 1844; but they were not far
353,FIRST VENTURE.,"apart in their homes, and during these years Lowell was making those"
354,FIRST VENTURE.,"early ventures in literature, and first raids upon political and moral"
355,FIRST VENTURE.,"evil, which foretold the direction of his later work, and gave some"
356,FIRST VENTURE.,hint of its abundance.
357,FIRST VENTURE.,
358,FIRST VENTURE.,"About the time of his marriage, he published two books which, by their"
359,FIRST VENTURE.,"character, show pretty well the divided interest of his life. His bent"
360,FIRST VENTURE.,from the beginning was more decidedly literary than that of any
361,FIRST VENTURE.,"contemporary American poet. That is to say, the history and art of"
362,FIRST VENTURE.,"literature divided his interest with the production of literature, and"
363,FIRST VENTURE.,"he carried the unusual gift of a rare critical power, joined to hearty"
364,FIRST VENTURE.,spontaneous creation. It may indeed be guessed that the keenness of
365,FIRST VENTURE.,judgment and incisiveness of wit which characterize his examination of
366,FIRST VENTURE.,"literature sometimes interfered with his poetic power, and made him"
367,FIRST VENTURE.,liable to question his art when he would rather have expressed it
368,FIRST VENTURE.,unchecked. One of the two books was a volume of poems; the other was a
369,FIRST VENTURE.,"prose work, _Conversations on Some of the Old Poets_. He did not keep"
370,FIRST VENTURE.,this book alive; but it is interesting as marking the enthusiasm of a
371,FIRST VENTURE.,"young scholar treading a way then almost wholly neglected in America,"
372,FIRST VENTURE.,and intimating a line of thought and study in which he afterward made
373,FIRST VENTURE.,"most noteworthy venture. Another series of poems followed in 1848, and"
374,FIRST VENTURE.,in the same year _The Vision of Sir Launfal_. Perhaps it was in
375,FIRST VENTURE.,reaction from the marked sentiment of his poetry that he issued now a
376,FIRST VENTURE.,"_jeu d'esprit, A Fable for Critics_, in which he hit off, with a rough"
377,FIRST VENTURE.,"and ready wit, the characteristics of the writers of the day, not"
378,FIRST VENTURE.,forgetting himself in these lines:
379,FIRST VENTURE.,
380,FIRST VENTURE.,"There is Lowell, who's striving Parnassus to climb"
381,FIRST VENTURE.,With a whole bale of _isms_ tied together with rhyme;
382,FIRST VENTURE.,"He might get on alone, spite of brambles and boulders,"
383,FIRST VENTURE.,But he can't with that bundle he has on his shoulders;
384,FIRST VENTURE.,The top of the hill he will ne'er come nigh reaching
385,FIRST VENTURE.,Till he learns the distinction 'twixt singing and preaching;
386,FIRST VENTURE.,"His lyre has some chords that would ring pretty well,"

390,FIRST VENTURE.,
391,FIRST VENTURE.,"This, of course, is but a half serious portrait of himself, and it"
392,FIRST VENTURE.,touches but a single feature; others can say better that Lowell's
393,FIRST VENTURE.,ardent nature showed itself in the series of satirical poems which
394,FIRST VENTURE.,"made him famous, _The Biglow Papers_, written in a spirit of"
395,FIRST VENTURE.,"indignation and fine scorn, when the Mexican War was causing many"
396,FIRST VENTURE.,Americans to blush with shame at the use of the country by a class for
397,FIRST VENTURE.,"its own ignoble ends. Lowell and his wife, who brought a fervid"
398,FIRST VENTURE.,"anti-slavery temper as part of her marriage portion, were both"
399,FIRST VENTURE.,contributors to the _Liberty Bell_; and Lowell was a frequent
400,FIRST VENTURE.,"contributor to the _Anti-Slavery Standard_, and was, indeed, for a"
401,FIRST VENTURE.,"while a corresponding editor. In June, 1846, there appeared one day in"
402,FIRST VENTURE.,the _Boston Courier_ a letter from Mr. Ezekiel Biglow of Jaalam to the
403,FIRST VENTURE.,"editor, Hon. Joseph T. Buckingham, inclosing a poem of his son, Mr."
404,FIRST VENTURE.,Hosea Biglow. It was no new thing to seek to arrest the public
405,FIRST VENTURE.,attention with the vernacular applied to public affairs. Major Jack
406,FIRST VENTURE.,"Downing and Sam Slick had been notable examples, and they had many"
407,FIRST VENTURE.,imitators; but the reader who laughed over the racy narrative of the
408,FIRST VENTURE.,"unlettered Ezekiel, and then took up Hosea's poem and caught the gust"
409,FIRST VENTURE.,"of Yankee wrath and humor blown fresh in his face, knew that he was in"
410,FIRST VENTURE.,at the appearance of something new in American literature. The force
411,FIRST VENTURE.,which Lowell displayed in these satires made his book at once a
412,FIRST VENTURE.,"powerful ally of an anti-slavery sentiment, which heretofore had been"
413,FIRST VENTURE.,ridiculed.

423,VERSE AND PROSE.,"A year in Europe, 1851-1852, with his wife, whose health was then"
424,VERSE AND PROSE.,"precarious, stimulated his scholarly interests, and gave substance to"
425,VERSE AND PROSE.,"his study of Dante and Italian literature. In October, 1853, his wife"
426,VERSE AND PROSE.,"died; she had borne him three children: the first-born, Blanche, died"
427,VERSE AND PROSE.,"in infancy; the second, Walter, also died young; the third, a"
428,VERSE AND PROSE.,"daughter, Mrs. Burnett, survived her parents. In 1855 he was chosen"
429,VERSE AND PROSE.,successor to Longfellow as Smith Professor of the French and Spanish
430,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Languages and Literature, and Professor of Belles Lettres in Harvard"
431,VERSE AND PROSE.,College. He spent two years in Europe in further preparation for the
432,VERSE AND PROSE.,"duties of his office, and in 1857 was again established in Cambridge,"
433,VERSE AND PROSE.,"and installed in his academic chair. He married, also, at this time"
434,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Miss Frances Dunlap, of Portland, Maine."
435,VERSE AND PROSE.,
436,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Lowell was now in his thirty-ninth year. As a scholar, in his"
437,VERSE AND PROSE.,"professional work, he had acquired a versatile knowledge of the"
438,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Romance languages, and was an adept in old French and Provençal"
439,VERSE AND PROSE.,poetry; he had given a course of twelve lectures on English poetry
440,VERSE AND PROSE.,"before the Lowell Institute in Boston, which had made a strong"
441,VERSE AND PROSE.,"impression on the community, and his work on the series of _British"
442,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Poets_ in connection with Professor Child, especially his biographical"
443,VERSE AND PROSE.,"sketch of Keats, had been recognized as of a high order. In poetry he"
444,VERSE AND PROSE.,had published the volumes already mentioned. In general literature he
445,VERSE AND PROSE.,had printed in magazines the papers which he afterward collected into
446,VERSE AND PROSE.,"his volume, _Fireside Travels_. Not long after he entered on his"
447,VERSE AND PROSE.,"college duties, _The Atlantic Monthly_ was started, and the editorship"
448,VERSE AND PROSE.,given to him. He held the office for a year or two only; but he
449,VERSE AND PROSE.,"continued to write for the magazine, and in 1862 he was associated"
450,VERSE AND PROSE.,with Mr. Charles Eliot Norton in the conduct of _The North American
451,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Review_, and continued in this charge for ten years. Much of his prose"
452,VERSE AND PROSE.,was contributed to this periodical. Any one reading the titles of the
453,VERSE AND PROSE.,papers which comprise the volumes of his prose writings will readily
454,VERSE AND PROSE.,"see how much literature, and especially poetic literature, occupied"
455,VERSE AND PROSE.,"his attention. Shakespeare, Dryden, Lessing, Rousseau, Dante, Spenser,"
456,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Wordsworth, Milton, Keats, Carlyle, Percival, Thoreau, Swinburne,"
457,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Chaucer, Emerson, Pope, Gray,--these are the principal subjects of his"
458,VERSE AND PROSE.,"prose, and the range of topics indicates the catholicity of his"
459,VERSE AND PROSE.,taste.
460,VERSE AND PROSE.,
461,VERSE AND PROSE.,"In these papers, when studying poetry, he was very alive to the"
462,VERSE AND PROSE.,"personality of the poets, and it was the strong interest in humanity"
463,VERSE AND PROSE.,"which led Lowell, when he was most diligent in the pursuit of"
464,VERSE AND PROSE.,"literature, to apply himself also to history and politics. Several of"
465,VERSE AND PROSE.,"his essays bear witness to this, such as _Witchcraft, New England Two"
466,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Centuries Ago, A Great Public Character_ (Josiah Quincy), _Abraham"
467,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Lincoln_, and his great _Political Essays_. But the most remarkable of"
468,VERSE AND PROSE.,his writings of this order was the second series of _The Biglow
469,VERSE AND PROSE.,"Papers_, published during the war for the Union. In these, with the"
470,VERSE AND PROSE.,"wit and fun of the earlier series, there was mingled a deeper strain"
471,VERSE AND PROSE.,of feeling and a larger tone of patriotism. The limitations of his
472,VERSE AND PROSE.,style in these satires forbade the fullest expression of his thought
473,VERSE AND PROSE.,"and emotion; but afterward in a succession of poems, occasioned by the"
474,VERSE AND PROSE.,"honors paid to student soldiers in Cambridge, the death of Agassiz,"
475,VERSE AND PROSE.,and the celebration of national anniversaries during the years 1875
476,VERSE AND PROSE.,"and 1876, he sang in loftier, more ardent strains. The most famous of"
477,VERSE AND PROSE.,these poems was his noble Commemoration Ode.

487,PUBLIC LIFE.,"It was at the close of this period, when he had done incalculable"
488,PUBLIC LIFE.,"service to the Republic, that Lowell was called on to represent the"
489,PUBLIC LIFE.,"country, first in Madrid, where he was sent in 1877, and then in"
490,PUBLIC LIFE.,"London, to which he was transferred in 1880. Eight years were thus"
491,PUBLIC LIFE.,spent by him in the foreign service of the country. He had a good
492,PUBLIC LIFE.,knowledge of the Spanish language and literature when he went to
493,PUBLIC LIFE.,Spain; but he at once took pains to make his knowledge fuller and his
494,PUBLIC LIFE.,"accent more perfect, so that he could have intimate relations with the"
495,PUBLIC LIFE.,best Spanish men of the time. In England he was at once a most welcome
496,PUBLIC LIFE.,"guest, and was in great demand as a public speaker. No one can read"
497,PUBLIC LIFE.,his dispatches from Madrid and London without being struck by his
498,PUBLIC LIFE.,"sagacity, his readiness in emergencies, his interest in and quick"
499,PUBLIC LIFE.,perception of the political situation in the country where he was
500,PUBLIC LIFE.,"resident, and his unerring knowledge as a man of the world. Above all,"
501,PUBLIC LIFE.,"he was through and through an American, true to the principles which"
502,PUBLIC LIFE.,"underlie American institutions. His address on _Democracy_, which he"
503,PUBLIC LIFE.,"delivered in England, is one of the great statements of human liberty."
504,PUBLIC LIFE.,"A few years later, after his return to America, he gave another"
505,PUBLIC LIFE.,address to his own countrymen on _The Place of the Independent in
506,PUBLIC LIFE.,"Politics_. It was a noble defense of his own position, not without a"
507,PUBLIC LIFE.,trace of discouragement at the apparently sluggish movement in
508,PUBLIC LIFE.,"American self-government of recent years, but with that faith in the"
509,PUBLIC LIFE.,substance of his countrymen which gave him the right to use words of
510,PUBLIC LIFE.,honest warning.
511,PUBLIC LIFE.,
512,PUBLIC LIFE.,The public life of Mr. Lowell made him more of a figure before the
513,PUBLIC LIFE.,world. He received honors from societies and universities; he was
514,PUBLIC LIFE.,decorated by the highest honors which Harvard could pay officially;
515,PUBLIC LIFE.,"and Oxford and Cambridge, St. Andrews and Edinburgh and Bologna, gave"
516,PUBLIC LIFE.,"gowns. He established warm personal relations with Englishmen, and,"
517,PUBLIC LIFE.,"after his release from public office, he made several visits to"
518,PUBLIC LIFE.,"England. There, too, was buried his wife, who died in 1885. The"
519,PUBLIC LIFE.,"closing years of his life in his own country, though touched with"
520,PUBLIC LIFE.,domestic loneliness and diminished by growing physical infirmities
521,PUBLIC LIFE.,"that predicted his death, were rich also with the continued expression"
522,PUBLIC LIFE.,of his large personality. He delivered the public address in
523,PUBLIC LIFE.,commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Harvard
524,PUBLIC LIFE.,University; he gave a course of lectures on the Old English Dramatists
525,PUBLIC LIFE.,before the Lowell Institute; he collected a volume of his poems; he
526,PUBLIC LIFE.,"wrote and spoke on public affairs; and, the year before his death,"
527,PUBLIC LIFE.,"revised, rearranged, and carefully edited a definitive series of his"
528,PUBLIC LIFE.,"writings in ten volumes. He died at Elmwood, August 12, 1891. Since"
529,PUBLIC LIFE.,his death three small volumes have been added to his collected
530,PUBLIC LIFE.,"writings, and Mr. Norton has published _Letters of James Russell"
531,PUBLIC LIFE.,"Lowell_, in two volumes."

541,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Lowell was in his thirtieth year when he wrote and published _The
542,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Vision of Sir Launfal_. It appeared when he had just dashed off his
543,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"_Fable for Critics_, and when he was in the thick of the anti-slavery"
544,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"fight, writing poetry and prose for _The Anti-Slavery Standard_, and"
545,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,sending out his witty _Biglow Papers_. He had married four years
546,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"before, and was living in the homestead at Elmwood, walking in the"
547,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"country about, and full of eagerness at the prospect which lay before"
548,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"him. In a letter to his friend Charles F. Briggs, written in December,"
549,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"1848, he says: ""Last night ... I walked to Watertown over the snow,"
550,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,with the new moon before me and a sky exactly like that in Page's
551,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"evening landscape. Orion was rising behind me, and, as I stood on the"
552,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"hill just before you enter the village, the stillness of the fields"
553,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"around me was delicious, broken only by the tinkle of a little brook"
554,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,which runs too swiftly for Frost to catch it. My picture of the brook
555,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,in _Sir Launfal_ was drawn from it. But why do I send you this
556,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"description,--like the bones of a chicken I had picked? Simply because"
557,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"I was so happy as I stood there, and felt so sure of doing something"
558,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,that would justify my friends. But why do I not say that I have done
559,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,something? I believe that I have done better than the world knows yet;
560,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,but the past seems so little compared with the future.... I am the
561,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"first poet who has endeavored to express the American Idea, and I"
562,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"shall be popular by and by."""
563,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
564,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,It is not very likely that Lowell was thinking of _Sir Launfal_ when
565,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"he wrote this last sentence, yet it is not straining language too far"
566,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,to say that when he took up an Arthurian story he had a different
567,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"attitude toward the whole cycle of legends from that of Tennyson, who"
568,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,had lately been reviving the legends for the pleasure of
569,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,English-reading people. The exuberance of the poet as he carols of
570,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,June in the prelude to Part First is an expression of the joyous
571,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"spring which was in the veins of the young American, glad in the sense"
572,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,of freedom and hope. As Tennyson threw into his retelling of Arthurian
573,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"romance a moral sense, so Lowell, also a moralist in his poetic"
574,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"apprehension, made a parable of his tale, and, in the broadest"
575,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"interpretation of democracy, sang of the leveling of all ranks in a"
576,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,common divine humanity. There is a subterranean passage connecting the
577,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,_Biglow Papers_ with _Sir Launfal_; it is the holy zeal which attacks
578,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"slavery issuing in this fable of a beautiful charity, Christ in the"
579,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,guise of a beggar.
580,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
581,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"The invention is a very simple one, and appears to have been suggested"
582,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"by Tennyson's _Sir Galahad_, though Lowell had no doubt read Sir"
583,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Thomas Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_. The following is the note which
584,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"accompanied _The Vision_ when first published in 1848, and retained by"
585,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Lowell in all subsequent editions:--
586,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
587,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"""According to the mythology of the Romancers, the San Greal,"
588,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"or Holy Grail, was the cup out of which Jesus Christ partook"
589,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,of the last supper with his disciples. It was brought into
590,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"England by Joseph of Arimathea, and remained there, an"
591,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"object of pilgrimage and adoration, for many years in the"
592,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,keeping of his lineal descendants. It was incumbent upon
593,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought, word,"
594,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and deed; but, one of the keepers having broken this"
595,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"condition, the Holy Grail disappeared. From that time it was"
596,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,a favorite enterprise of the Knights of Arthur's court to go
597,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,in search of it. Sir Galahad was at last successful in
598,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"finding it, as may be read in the seventeenth book of the"
599,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Romance of King Arthur. Tennyson has made Sir Galahad the
600,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems.

1781,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,As with her nectar Hebe Autumn fills                             5
1782,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The bowl between me and those distant hills,"
1783,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"And smiles and shakes abroad her misty, tremulous hair!"
1784,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
1785,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"No more the landscape holds its wealth apart,"
1786,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Making me poorer in my poverty,"
1787,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,But mingles with my senses and my heart;                        10
1788,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,My own projected spirit seems to me
1789,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,In her own reverie the world to steep;
1790,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"'Tis she that waves to sympathetic sleep,"
1791,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Moving, as she is moved, each field and hill and tree."
1792,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,

1799,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,And floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms.
1800,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
1801,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Far distant sounds the hidden chickadee
1802,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Close at my side; far distant sound the leaves;
1803,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The fields seem fields of dream, where Memory"
1804,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Wanders like gleaning Ruth; and as the sheaves                    25
1805,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
1806,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Of Boaz as the maiden's glow went by,"

1821,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Then drops his nut, and, with a chipping bound,                 40"
1822,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Whisks to his winding fastness underground;
1823,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere.
1824,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
1825,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,O'er yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows

1835,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,And hints at her foregone gentilities
1836,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,With some saved relics of her wealth of leaves;
1837,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The swamp-oak, with his royal purple on,"
1838,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Glares red as blood across the sinking sun,                     55"
1839,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,As one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves.

1845,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"Sees the hushed wood the city's flare replace,"
1846,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The wounded turf heal o'er the railway's trace,"
1847,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,And roams the savage Past of his undwindled rights.
1848,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,
1849,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"The red-oak, softer-grained, yields all for lost,"
1850,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"And, with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry,                     65"
1851,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,"After the first betrayal of the frost,"
1852,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE.,Rebuffs the kiss of the relenting sky;

2254,PROMETHEUS.,[The classic legend of Prometheus underwent various changes in

2256,PROMETHEUS.,"the same: that Prometheus, whose name signifies Forethought, stole"
2257,PROMETHEUS.,"fire from Zeus, or Jupiter, or Jove, and gave it as a gift to man. For"
2258,PROMETHEUS.,"this, the angry god bound him upon Mount Caucasus, and decreed that a"
2259,PROMETHEUS.,"vulture should prey upon his liver, destroying every day what was"

2261,PROMETHEUS.,from the tyranny of fear and superstition and all monsters of the
2262,PROMETHEUS.,imagination is illustrated in the myth. The myth is one which has been
2263,PROMETHEUS.,"a favorite with modern poets, as witness Goethe, Shelley, Mrs."

2293,PROMETHEUS.,A shape as of a woman: very pale
2294,PROMETHEUS.,"It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move,"
2295,PROMETHEUS.,"And mine moved not, but only stared on them."

2302,PROMETHEUS.,"Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought"
2303,PROMETHEUS.,"Some doom was close upon me, and I looked"

2305,PROMETHEUS.,"Just setting, and it seemed as it were falling,"

2307,PROMETHEUS.,And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged
2308,PROMETHEUS.,"Into the rising surges of the pines,"
2309,PROMETHEUS.,"Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins"
2310,PROMETHEUS.,"Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength,"
2311,PROMETHEUS.,"Sent up a murmur in the morning wind,                               45"

2313,PROMETHEUS.,"All day and night to high Olympus soars,"

2358,PROMETHEUS.,"That seems but apt to stir a maiden's hair,"
2359,PROMETHEUS.,Sways huge Oceanus from pole to pole;
2360,PROMETHEUS.,"For I am still Prometheus, and foreknow"
2361,PROMETHEUS.,In my wise heart the end and doom of all.
2362,PROMETHEUS.,
2363,PROMETHEUS.,"Yes, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown                           95"
2364,PROMETHEUS.,"By years of solitude,--that holds apart"
2365,PROMETHEUS.,"The past and future, giving the soul room"
2366,PROMETHEUS.,"To search into itself,--and long commune"
2367,PROMETHEUS.,"With this eternal silence;--more a god,"
2368,PROMETHEUS.,In my long-suffering and strength to meet                          100
2369,PROMETHEUS.,"With equal front the direst shafts of fate,"
2370,PROMETHEUS.,"Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism,"
2371,PROMETHEUS.,Girt with thy baby-toys of force and wrath.
2372,PROMETHEUS.,"Yes, I am that Prometheus who brought down"
2373,PROMETHEUS.,"The light to man, which thou, in selfish fear,                     105"
2374,PROMETHEUS.,"Hadst to thyself usurped,--his by sole right,"
2375,PROMETHEUS.,"For Man hath right to all save Tyranny,--"
2376,PROMETHEUS.,And which shall free him yet from thy frail throne.
2377,PROMETHEUS.,"Tyrants are but the spawn of Ignorance,"

2380,PROMETHEUS.,"And see that Tyranny is always weakness,"
2381,PROMETHEUS.,"Or Fear with its own bosom ill at ease,"
2382,PROMETHEUS.,Would laugh away in scorn the sand-wove chain
2383,PROMETHEUS.,Which their own blindness feigned for adamant.                     115
2384,PROMETHEUS.,"Wrong ever builds on quicksands, but the Right"
2385,PROMETHEUS.,To the firm centre lays its moveless base.
2386,PROMETHEUS.,"The tyrant trembles, if the air but stirs"
2387,PROMETHEUS.,"The innocent ringlets of a child's free hair,"
2388,PROMETHEUS.,"And crouches, when the thought of some great spirit,               120"
2389,PROMETHEUS.,"With world-wide murmur, like a rising gale,"
2390,PROMETHEUS.,"Over men's hearts, as over standing corn,"
2391,PROMETHEUS.,"Rushes, and bends them to its own strong will."
2392,PROMETHEUS.,"So shall some thought of mine yet circle earth,"

2403,PROMETHEUS.,"A sorrow-taught, unconquered Titan-heart."
2404,PROMETHEUS.,"Men, when their death is on them, seem to stand"
2405,PROMETHEUS.,On a precipitous crag that overhangs

2407,PROMETHEUS.,"As in a glass, the features dim and vast"
2408,PROMETHEUS.,"Of things to come, the shadows, as it seems,"
2409,PROMETHEUS.,Of what had been. Death ever fronts the wise;
2410,PROMETHEUS.,"Not fearfully, but with clear promises"

2414,PROMETHEUS.,Even to the very source and end of things.
2415,PROMETHEUS.,Such am I now: immortal woe hath made

2417,PROMETHEUS.,Between the substance and the shadow of Truth.
2418,PROMETHEUS.,"The sure supremeness of the Beautiful,"
2419,PROMETHEUS.,By all the martyrdoms made doubly sure
2420,PROMETHEUS.,"Of such as I am, this is my revenge,"
2421,PROMETHEUS.,"Which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch,                        150"
2422,PROMETHEUS.,Through which I see a sceptre and a throne.
2423,PROMETHEUS.,"The pipings of glad shepherds on the hills,"
2424,PROMETHEUS.,"Tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee,--"
2425,PROMETHEUS.,The songs of maidens pressing with white feet
2426,PROMETHEUS.,"The vintage on thine altars poured no more,--                      155"
2427,PROMETHEUS.,"The murmurous bliss of lovers, underneath"
2428,PROMETHEUS.,"Dim grapevine bowers, whose rosy bunches press"
2429,PROMETHEUS.,"Not half so closely their warm cheeks, unpaled"
2430,PROMETHEUS.,"By thoughts of thy brute lust,--the hive-like hum"
2431,PROMETHEUS.,"Of peaceful commonwealths, where sunburnt Toil                     160"
2432,PROMETHEUS.,Reaps for itself the rich earth made its own
2433,PROMETHEUS.,"By its own labor, lightened with glad hymns"
2434,PROMETHEUS.,To an omnipotence which thy mad bolts
2435,PROMETHEUS.,"Would cope with as a spark with the vast sea,--"

2437,PROMETHEUS.,"Duty's sure recompense through life and death,--"
2438,PROMETHEUS.,These are such harvests as all master-spirits
2439,PROMETHEUS.,"Reap, haply not on earth, but reap no less"
2440,PROMETHEUS.,Because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs;
2441,PROMETHEUS.,These are the bloodless daggers wherewithal                        170
2442,PROMETHEUS.,"They stab fallen tyrants, this their high revenge:"
2443,PROMETHEUS.,"For their best part of life on earth is when,"

2447,PROMETHEUS.,"When, like the moon, herself behind a cloud,"
2448,PROMETHEUS.,"They shed down light before us on life's sea,"
2449,PROMETHEUS.,That cheers us to steer onward still in hope.
2450,PROMETHEUS.,Earth with her twining memories ivies o'er
2451,PROMETHEUS.,"Their holy sepulchres; the chainless sea,                          180"
2452,PROMETHEUS.,"In tempest or wide calm, repeats their thoughts;"
2453,PROMETHEUS.,"The lightning and the thunder, all free things,"
2454,PROMETHEUS.,Have legends of them for the ears of men.
2455,PROMETHEUS.,"All other glories are as falling stars,"
2456,PROMETHEUS.,But universal Nature watches theirs:                               185
2457,PROMETHEUS.,Such strength is won by love of human-kind.
2458,PROMETHEUS.,
2459,PROMETHEUS.,"Not that I feel that hunger after fame,"
2460,PROMETHEUS.,Which souls of a half-greatness are beset with;

2463,PROMETHEUS.,And keeps the heart of Man forever up
2464,PROMETHEUS.,To the heroic level of old time.
2465,PROMETHEUS.,To be forgot at first is little pain
2466,PROMETHEUS.,To a heart conscious of such high intent

2468,PROMETHEUS.,"But, having been a name, to sink and be"

2472,PROMETHEUS.,"A cup of bitterness the worst to taste,                            200"
2473,PROMETHEUS.,And this thy heart shall empty to the dregs.

2481,PROMETHEUS.,"Which might have made me, scarcely less than thou,"
2482,PROMETHEUS.,"A god among my brethren weak and blind,--                          210"
2483,PROMETHEUS.,"Scarce less than thou, a pitiable thing"
2484,PROMETHEUS.,To be down-trodden into darkness soon.
2485,PROMETHEUS.,"But now I am above thee, for thou art"
2486,PROMETHEUS.,"The bungling workmanship of fear, the block"
2487,PROMETHEUS.,That awes the swart Barbarian; but I                               215
2488,PROMETHEUS.,"Am what myself have made,--a nature wise"
2489,PROMETHEUS.,"With finding in itself the types of all,--"

2493,PROMETHEUS.,"Wise with the history of its own frail heart,"

2506,PROMETHEUS.,"Clear as a silver trumpet, to awake"
2507,PROMETHEUS.,Huge echoes that from age to age live on
2508,PROMETHEUS.,"In kindred spirits, giving them a sense                            235"
2509,PROMETHEUS.,Of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung:
2510,PROMETHEUS.,And many a glazing eye shall smile to see
2511,PROMETHEUS.,The memory of my triumph (for to meet
2512,PROMETHEUS.,"Wrong with endurance, and to overcome"

2516,PROMETHEUS.,"Evil springs up, and flowers, and bears no seed,"
