35,LEAVES,=Autumn Leaves= was in the hands of the Publisher (BRUCE BROUGH) at the
36,LEAVES,"time of the Great Fire of April, 1906, and not a single page of the"
37,LEAVES,"original manuscript was saved. I could only recall a few titles, and"
38,LEAVES,"a line or two here and there, not knowing though where they belonged."
39,LEAVES,"I began to rewrite on the 12th of June, 1908, and on the 12th of"
40,LEAVES,"September, 1908, it was ready for publication. It has given _me_ new"
41,LEAVES,"courage, and by searching, perhaps _you_ may find one leaf among my"
42,LEAVES,"=Autumn Leaves= that you will feel was painted expressly for you, and"
43,LEAVES,is worthy to be pressed upon the tablet of your heart.

54,TO MY MOTHER,
55,TO MY MOTHER,Who ever watched with loving care
56,TO MY MOTHER,My childhood’s tender years.
57,TO MY MOTHER,"She ever soothed my little woes,"
58,TO MY MOTHER,And kissed away my tears.
59,TO MY MOTHER,
60,TO MY MOTHER,"She guided me o’er Life’s rough road,"
61,TO MY MOTHER,"And pointed out the snares,"
62,TO MY MOTHER,And pitfalls that are e’er in life;
63,TO MY MOTHER,"And all the many tares,"
64,TO MY MOTHER,
65,TO MY MOTHER,"And brambles that beset Life’s paths,"
66,TO MY MOTHER,"And if I fell by way,"
67,TO MY MOTHER,"She helped me up with loving hands,"
68,TO MY MOTHER,And tender words alway.
