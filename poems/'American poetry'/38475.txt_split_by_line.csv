68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,The present edition of the poetical works of Philip Freneau was begun at
70,PREFACE,the advice of the late lamented Moses Coit Tyler. In his opinion there
71,PREFACE,"were few fields in American history that needed exploring more, and few"
72,PREFACE,that would require on the part of the explorer more of the Columbus
73,PREFACE,spirit.
74,PREFACE,
75,PREFACE,It would be almost impossible for a poet to pass more completely into
76,PREFACE,the shadow than has Freneau during the century since his activities
77,PREFACE,"closed. His poems are, almost all of them in their earliest editions,"
78,PREFACE,exceedingly rare and costly and only to be read by those who can have
79,PREFACE,"access to the largest libraries, his letters and papers have almost"
80,PREFACE,"entirely disappeared, and his biography in almost every book of"
81,PREFACE,reference has been so distorted by misstatement and omission as to be
82,PREFACE,really grotesque.
83,PREFACE,
84,PREFACE,"This neglect has resulted not from lack of real worth in the man, but"
85,PREFACE,from prejudices born during one of the most bitter and stormy eras of
86,PREFACE,partisan politics that America has ever known. What Sidney Smith said of
87,PREFACE,"Scotland at this period was true here: ""The principles of the French"
88,PREFACE,Revolution were fully afloat and it is impossible to conceive a more
89,PREFACE,"violent and agitated state of society."" Freneau was a victim of this"
90,PREFACE,intense era. New England rejected him with scorn and all admirers of
91,PREFACE,"Washington echoed his epithet, ""that rascal Freneau."" Thus it has become"
92,PREFACE,"the tradition to belittle his work, to vilify his character, and to sum"
93,PREFACE,"up his whole career, as a prominent New Englander has recently done, by"
94,PREFACE,"alluding to him as a ""creature of the opposition."""
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,"Unprejudiced criticism, however, has always exalted Freneau's work. The"
97,PREFACE,"great Scotch dictator Jeffrey, with all his scorn for American"
98,PREFACE,"literature, could say that ""the time would arrive when his poetry, like"
99,PREFACE,"that of Hudibras, would command a commentator like Gray;"" and Sir Walter"
100,PREFACE,"Scott once declared that ""Eutaw Springs [was] as fine a thing as there"
101,PREFACE,"is of the kind in the language."" E. A. Duyckinck did not hesitate to"
102,PREFACE,"group him as one of ""four of the most original writers whom the country"
103,PREFACE,"has produced,"" and S. G. W. Benjamin could say in 1887: ""In all the"
104,PREFACE,"history of American letters, or of the United States press, there is no"
105,PREFACE,"figure more interesting or remarkable, no career more versatile and"
106,PREFACE,"varied than that of Philip Freneau."" Such testimony might be multiplied."
107,PREFACE,"Surely had the poet been an ordinary man, Jefferson would never have"
108,PREFACE,"said ""his paper has saved our Constitution,"" Madison would not have"
109,PREFACE,"pronounced him a man of genius, and Adams would hardly have admitted"
110,PREFACE,that he was a leading element in his defeat.
111,PREFACE,
112,PREFACE,I have endeavored not only to rescue the most significant of Freneau's
113,PREFACE,"poems, but to arrange them as far as possible in their order of"
114,PREFACE,"composition, or at least in the order in which they first appeared in"
115,PREFACE,print. It has seemed to me highly important to do this since such an
116,PREFACE,"arrangement, especially with a poet like Freneau, who drew his themes"
117,PREFACE,"almost wholly from the range of his own observation, would be virtually"
118,PREFACE,"an autobiography, and since it would also furnish a running commentary"
119,PREFACE,upon the history of a stirring period in our annals. The task has been
120,PREFACE,no slight one. It has necessitated a search through the files of a large
121,PREFACE,proportion of the early newspapers and periodicals and a minute
122,PREFACE,investigation of every other source of possible information.
123,PREFACE,
124,PREFACE,"Much material has been rescued that, as far as the public was concerned,"
125,PREFACE,had practically become extinct. I have introduced the unique fragment of
126,PREFACE,"an unpublished drama, ""The Spy,"" which I was the first to explore. I"
127,PREFACE,have taken pains to reproduce the poet's early poetical pamphlets
128,PREFACE,"dealing with the first year of the Revolution, not one of which has ever"
129,PREFACE,been republished. The revisions of many of these used by Freneau in his
130,PREFACE,later collections were so thoroughgoing as to be in reality entirely new
131,PREFACE,"poems. ""The Voyage to Boston,"" for instance, published during the siege"
132,PREFACE,"of Boston, was cut down for the 1786 edition from six hundred and five"
133,PREFACE,"lines to three hundred and six lines, and of these more than half were"
134,PREFACE,"entirely changed. From the standpoint of the historian, at least, the"
135,PREFACE,original version is much more valuable than that made several years
136,PREFACE,after the war was over. This is true of all the earlier pamphlet poems.
137,PREFACE,Aside from their value as specimens of Freneau's earlier muse they are
138,PREFACE,valuable commentaries on the history of the stormy times that called
139,PREFACE,"them forth, and I have not hesitated to reprint them verbatim in"
140,PREFACE,"connection with the revised versions. The pamphlet poems ""American"
141,PREFACE,"Liberty"" and ""General Gage's Confession,"" (until recently supposed to"
142,PREFACE,have been lost) exist only in unique copies. Freneau never attempted to
143,PREFACE,"revise them. Some of the other early poems, notably ""The House of"
144,PREFACE,"Night,"" I have annotated with care, showing the evolution of the poem"
145,PREFACE,from its first nucleus to its final fragmentary form. In the case of a
146,PREFACE,"few of the more important poems, especially those dealing with the"
147,PREFACE,"Revolution, I have given variorum readings."
148,PREFACE,
149,PREFACE,"Aside from this early material, which has a real historical value, I"
150,PREFACE,have introduced very few poems not included in Freneau's collected
151,PREFACE,"editions of 1786, 1788, 1795, 1809 and 1815. Previous to 1795 the poet"
152,PREFACE,reprinted with miserly care almost all the verses which he had
153,PREFACE,contributed to the press. In his later years he was more prodigal of his
154,PREFACE,"creations. I have, however, reprinted from newspapers very few poems not"
155,PREFACE,"found elsewhere, and these few only on the best evidence that they were"
156,PREFACE,"genuine, for it has been my experience that when a poem is not to be"
157,PREFACE,found in the collected editions of the poet it is almost certain that it
158,PREFACE,"is not genuine. In justice to Freneau, who had the welfare of his"
159,PREFACE,"writings much at heart, and who cut and pruned and remodeled with"
160,PREFACE,"tireless hand, I have usually given the latest version."
161,PREFACE,
162,PREFACE,I wish to acknowledge here my great indebtedness to the descendants of
163,PREFACE,"Philip Freneau, especially Miss Adele M. Sweeney, Mr. Weymer J. Mills,"
164,PREFACE,"Mrs. Helen K. Vreeland, and Mrs. Eleanor F. Noël, who have allowed me to"
165,PREFACE,consult freely all the papers and literary remains of the poet and have
166,PREFACE,supplied me with all possible information. I would also express my great
167,PREFACE,"obligation to many librarians, collectors, and scholars, who have"
168,PREFACE,"cheerfully aided me, especially to Mr. Wilberforce Eames, of the New"
169,PREFACE,"York Public Library, the late Paul Leicester Ford, Mr. Robert H. Kelby,"
170,PREFACE,"of the New York Historical Society, Mr. John W. Jordan, of the"
171,PREFACE,"Pennsylvania Historical Society, Mr. A. S. Salley, Jr., of Charleston,"
172,PREFACE,"S. C., Mr. E. M. Barton, of the American Antiquarian Society, and Dr. E."
173,PREFACE,"C. Richardson, of Princeton University, who with their courteous"
174,PREFACE,helpfulness have made possible the work. I wish also to express my
175,PREFACE,"thanks to Professor A. Howry Espenshade, and Mr. John Rogers Williams,"
176,PREFACE,to whose careful and patient work upon the proofs the accuracy of the
177,PREFACE,text depends.

258,I.,
259,I.,In the possession of the Freneau descendants there is an old French
260,I.,"Bible, printed in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1587, which preserves an"
261,I.,unbroken roll of the heads of the family back to the original owner of
262,I.,"the book, Philip Fresneau, who on his death-bed in La Chapelle, France,"
263,I.,"in 1590, gave it into the hands of his eldest son. For five generations"
264,I.,"the book remained in the little suburban village, its possessors sturdy,"
265,I.,"industrious tradesmen, who stood high in the esteem of their community"
266,I.,and yet who on account of their Protestant faith were often imposed upon
267,I.,and at times even persecuted. It was doubtless this feeling of
268,I.,"insecurity, if not positive persecution, which compelled André Fresneau,"
269,I.,"like so many of his fellow Huguenots, to leave his native village and to"
270,I.,seek a home in a more tolerant land.
271,I.,
272,I.,"He landed in New York in 1707. He was in his thirty-sixth year, an"
273,I.,"active, handsome man, almost brilliant in certain directions, of"
274,I.,"pleasing address, and skilled from his youth in the handling of affairs."
275,I.,He became at once a leader in the little Huguenot Colony whose center
276,I.,"was the quaint old church ""du St. Esprit"" on Pine street. He was soon in"
277,I.,"the midst of a thriving shipping business, dealing largely in imported"
278,I.,"wines, and in 1710, three years after his arrival, he was able to"
279,I.,"furnish a beautiful home on Pearl street, near Hanover Square, for his"
280,I.,"young bride, Mary Morin, a daughter of Pierre Morin, of the French"
281,I.,Congregation. Of the comfort and hospitality of this home there are many
282,I.,"contemporary references. John Fontaine, the French traveller, was"
283,I.,entertained here in 1716 and he speaks highly of his host and his
284,I.,entertainment.[1]
285,I.,
286,I.,"In 1721 Mrs. Fresneau died at the early age of twenty-seven, leaving"
287,I.,"behind a family of five children, the oldest only nine years of age."
288,I.,Four years later the father followed. But the young family was far from
289,I.,destitute. The business house in New York had grown to be very
290,I.,"profitable and there was a large landed estate in eastern New Jersey, a"
291,I.,"part of which was sold in 1740. Soon the two eldest sons, Andrew, born"
292,I.,"1712, and Pierre, born January 22, 1718, were able to continue their"
293,I.,father's business. For years their firm name was familiar in New York.
294,I.,
295,I.,"Pierre Freneau (the family seem to have dropped the ""s"" about 1725) was"
296,I.,"married in 1748 to Agnes Watson, daughter of Richard Watson, of"
297,I.,"Freehold, whose property bordered upon the Freneau estate. They made"
298,I.,"their home in Frankfort street, New York, and here on January 2 (O. S.),"
299,I.,"1752, was born their eldest child, Philip Morin Freneau, the subject of"
300,I.,"our sketch. Four other children came from their union, of whom only one,"
301,I.,"Peter, born April 5, 1757, who in later years became a prominent figure"
302,I.,"in Charleston, S. C., need be mentioned."
303,I.,
304,I.,The home of the Freneau's was one of comfort and even refinement. There
305,I.,"was a large and well selected library, the pride of its owner. ""There,"""
306,I.,"he would say to his visitors, pointing to his books, ""use them freely,"
307,I.,"for among them you will find your truest friends."" He delighted in men"
308,I.,"of refinement, and his home became a social center for the lovers of"
309,I.,books and of culture. He looked carefully after the education of his
310,I.,children; and all of them early became omnivorous readers. In such an
311,I.,environment the young poet passed his first ten years.
312,I.,
313,I.,In 1762 the family decided to leave New York and to make their home
314,I.,"permanently on their estate, ""Mount Pleasant,"" near Middletown Point, N."
315,I.,"J. The estate at this time contained nearly a thousand acres, and with"
316,I.,"its large buildings, its slaves and its broad area under cultivation,"
317,I.,was in many respects like a southern plantation. Heretofore the elder
318,I.,Freneau had made it of secondary importance. He had used it as a summer
319,I.,"resort, and as a pleasant relief to the monotony of his city business,"
320,I.,"but now, perhaps on account of failing health, he determined to devote"
321,I.,to it all of his energies. Philip was left behind in New York. For the
322,I.,"next three years he lived at a boarding school in the city, going home"
323,I.,only during the long vacations. At the age of thirteen he was sent to
324,I.,"the Latin school at Penolopen, then presided over by the Rev. Alexander"
325,I.,"Mitchell, to prepare for college."
326,I.,
327,I.,"The father of the family died Oct. 17, 1767. This, however, did not"
328,I.,"disturb the plans of the eldest son, and on Nov. 7, 1768, he entered the"
329,I.,sophomore class at Princeton so well prepared that President Witherspoon
330,I.,is said to have sent a letter of congratulation to his mother.
331,I.,
332,I.,
333,II.,II.
334,II.,
335,II.,Of the college life of Philip Freneau we have only fragmentary records.
336,II.,"He was in his sixteenth year when he entered, a somewhat dreamy youth"
337,II.,"who had read very widely, especially in the English poets and the Latin"
338,II.,"classics, and who already commanded a facile pen, especially in the"
339,II.,field of heroic verse. During the year in which he entered Princeton he
340,II.,"composed two long poems, ""The History of the Prophet Jonah,"" and ""The"
341,II.,"Village Merchant,""--surely notable work for the pen of a college"
342,II.,"sophomore. During the following year he wrote ""The Pyramids of Egypt,"""
343,II.,"and before his graduation he had completed several other pieces, some of"
344,II.,them full of real poetic inspiration.
345,II.,
346,II.,The period during which Freneau resided at Princeton was a most
347,II.,"significant one. In the same class with him were James Madison, H. H."
348,II.,"Brackenridge, the author of ""Modern Chivalry"" and a conspicuous figure"
349,II.,"in later Pennsylvania history, and Samuel Spring, who was to become"
350,II.,widely influential in religious circles. In the class below him were the
351,II.,refined and scholarly William Bradford and the brilliant Aaron Burr. The
352,II.,shadow of the coming struggle with Great Britain was already lengthening
353,II.,over the Colonies and nowhere was its presence more manifest than in the
354,II.,"colleges, always the most sensitive areas in times of tyranny and"
355,II.,"oppression. On August 6, 1770, the senior class at Princeton voted"
356,II.,unanimously to appear at commencement dressed in American manufactures.
357,II.,
358,II.,"Another circumstance made the period a notable one. On June 24, 1769, a"
359,II.,"little band of students, headed by Madison, Brackenridge, Bradford and"
360,II.,"Freneau, organized an undergraduate fraternity to be called the"
361,II.,"American Whig Society. One year later The Well Meaning Club, a rival"
362,II.,"literary organization founded in 1765, became the Cliosophic Society."
363,II.,"The act was the signal for a war, the echoes of which have even yet not"
364,II.,"died away at Princeton. There exists a manuscript book,[2] rescued from"
365,II.,"the papers of William Bradford, in which are preserved the poetic"
366,II.,"tirades, called forth in this first onset. Its title page is as follows:"
367,II.,
368,II.,"""Satires | against the Tories. | Written in the last War between the"
369,II.,Whigs & Cliosophians | in which | the former obtained a compleat
370,II.,Victory.
371,II.,
372,II.,--Arm'd for virtue now we point the pen
373,II.,"Brand the bold front of shameless, guilty men"
374,II.,Dash the proud Tory in his gilded Car
375,II.,"Bare the mean heart that hides beneath a star."""
376,II.,
377,II.,"It opens with ten ""pastorals"" by Brackenridge, of which the ninth begins"
378,II.,thus:
379,II.,
380,II.,"""Spring's Soliloquy that morning before he hung himself."
381,II.,
382,II.,O World adieu! the doleful time draws nigh
383,II.,I cannot live and yet I fear to die
384,II.,Warford is dead! and in his turn Freneau
385,II.,Will send me headlong to the shades below.
386,II.,What raging fury or what baleful Star
387,II.,Did find--ingulph me in the whiggish war
388,II.,The deeds of darkness which my soul hath done
389,II.,Are now apparent as the noon-day sun
390,II.,A Thousand things as yet remain untold
391,II.,"My secret practice and my sins of old."""
392,II.,
393,II.,"Then follow several satires by Freneau, full of fire and invective, but"
394,II.,"like the work of all the others, not always refined or quotable in"
395,II.,"print. His satire, ""McSwiggen,"" printed in 1775, contains nearly half"
396,II.,"of the poems,--the only lines indeed which are of any real merit. The"
397,II.,"three concluding poems of the collection, and these by all means the"
398,II.,"worst of the lot, are from no less a pen than Madison's. No patriotic"
399,II.,citizen will ever venture to resurrect them.
400,II.,
401,II.,There is a tradition very widely current that Freneau was for a time the
402,II.,"room-mate of Madison. However this may be, there is no question as to"
403,II.,who was his most intimate friend. With Brackenridge he had much in
404,II.,"common. Both had dreams of a literary life, both had read largely in"
405,II.,"polite literature, both scribbled constantly in prose and verse. In the"
406,II.,same manuscript volume with the Clio-Whig satires there is an extensive
407,II.,"fragment of a novel written alternately by Brackenridge and Freneau,"
408,II.,"between September 20th and October 22d, 1770. Its manuscript title page"
409,II.,is as follows:
410,II.,
411,II.,"""Father Bombo's | Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia. | Vol. II. |"
412,II.,Wherein is given a true account of the innumerable and | surprizing
413,II.,adventures which befell him in the course of that | long and
414,II.,"tedious Journey, | Till he once more returned safe to his native"

636,III.,
637,III.,"In the early summer of 1775, Freneau suddenly appeared in New York as a"
638,III.,publicist of remarkable fluency. Before November he had issued no less
639,III.,"than eight long poems as separate publications, nearly all of them"
640,III.,called forth by the new crisis in American affairs. Beginning with
641,III.,"""American Liberty,"" issued by Anderson, the editor of the new patriotic"
642,III.,"weekly, _The Constitutional Gazette_, he published pamphlet after"
643,III.,"pamphlet in rapid succession, all of them throwing upon Gage and the"
644,III.,British cause in Boston all the satire and invective which he had used
645,III.,so mercilessly in the old society war at Princeton. Two of these were
646,III.,"published by Hugh Gaine, and another, ""The Voyage to Boston,"" first"
647,III.,"issued by Anderson, was reprinted at once in Philadelphia. All of them"
648,III.,"have fared hardly during the years. Several, like ""General Gage's"
649,III.,"Soliloquy,"" and ""Timothy Taurus,"" which recounts the story of a journey"
650,III.,"made by Freneau to Passaic Falls, near Paterson, New Jersey, in August,"
651,III.,"have disappeared entirely, one of them, the ""General Gage's Confession,"""
652,III.,"has never been republished in any form, and all the others were cut down"
653,III.,and altered by the author for later editions until they were almost in
654,III.,every respect entirely new poems.
655,III.,
656,III.,"That these voluminous and vigorous tirades, which their author evidently"
657,III.,"poured forth with perfect ease, were criticised and condemned by the"
658,III.,fastidious we have no evidence. Certain it is that judging by the
659,III.,"contemporary newspaper press they were exceedingly popular. Yet, in"
660,III.,"November we find Freneau in a sad state of discouragement, ready to give"
661,III.,"up forever all association with the muses. Some one, envious of his"
662,III.,"rising fame, has criticised him unmercifully. He seeks out the old"
663,III.,Clio-Whig satires and after adapting and reshaping them he hurls them at
664,III.,the head of his enemy whom he designates as McSwiggen.
665,III.,
666,III.,Great Jove in wrath a spark of genius gave
667,III.,"And bade me drink the mad Pierian wave,"
668,III.,"Hence came those rhymes with truth ascribed to me,"
669,III.,That urge your little soul to jealousy.

674,III.,Who bade your foolish muse with us engage?
675,III.,"Against a windmill would you try your might,"
676,III.,Against a castle would a pigmy fight?
677,III.,
678,III.,The young poet had begun to realize how barren was the new world in
679,III.,poetic appreciation; how impossible it was for even a true poet to
680,III.,"practice his art where few could appreciate, and none really cared:"
681,III.,
682,III.,Alone I stand to meet the foul-mouthed train
683,III.,Assisted by no poets of the plain.
684,III.,
685,III.,He looked longingly across the water where poets were appreciated:
686,III.,
687,III.,"Long have I sat on this disastrous shore,"
688,III.,And sighing sought to gain a passage o'er
689,III.,"To Europe's towns, where as our travellers say"
690,III.,"Poets may flourish, or perhaps they may."
691,III.,
692,III.,The poem was a valedictory.
693,III.,
694,III.,"I to the sea with weary steps descend,"
695,III.,"Quit the mean conquest, that such swine must yield"
696,III.,And leave McSwiggen to enjoy the field.
697,III.,In distant isles some happier scene I'll choose
698,III.,And court in softer shades the unwilling muse.
699,III.,
700,III.,Freneau had determined to spend the winter in the West Indies. He had
701,III.,become acquainted during the autumn with a West Indian gentleman by the
702,III.,"name of Hanson, who owned large estates in the islands, and who sailed"
703,III.,master of his own vessel. Upon his invitation Freneau became a passenger
704,III.,late in November for the Island of Santa Cruz. Early in the voyage the
705,III.,"mate died, and the young poet, his education outweighing his"
706,III.,"inexperience in nautical matters, was chosen to fill his place. The"
707,III.,"study of navigation, made necessary by this step, doubtless turned the"
708,III.,direction of his whole life.
709,III.,
710,III.,For the next two years Freneau made his home on Captain Hanson's estate
711,III.,on the Island of Santa Cruz. A selection from one of his letters
712,III.,charmingly describes the spot.
713,III.,
714,III.,"""The town at the west end is but mean and ordinary, consisting of a"
715,III.,fort and perhaps 80 or 90 wooden houses. The harbor is nothing but
716,III.,"an open road, where, however, ships lie in the utmost security at"
717,III.,"their moorings, the bottom being good for anchorage and the wind"
718,III.,"always off shore. About two miles to the eastward of this town,"
719,III.,"along the seashore, is the estate of Capt. Hanson, into which the"
720,III.,"sea has formed a beautiful little bay, called Buttler's Bay, about"
721,III.,"100 yards across; it has a sandy shore and an excellent landing,"
722,III.,though all the rest of the shore is sharp craggy rocks. My
723,III.,"agreeable residence at this place for above two years, off and on"
724,III.,"during the wars in America, renders the idea of it all too"
725,III.,"pleasing, and makes me feel much the same anxiety at a distance"
726,III.,from it as Adam did after he was banished from the bowers of
727,III.,"Eden.""[5]"
728,III.,
729,III.,He seems to have been employed at intervals by Captain Hanson in voyages
730,III.,"about the islands. Thus he records of the Island of St. James, that ""I"
731,III.,"went over July 13, 1777, and remained there eight days. We loaded our"
732,III.,"vessel with coral rock, which is used in these islands for burning lime"
733,III.,"of a very excellent quality."""
734,III.,
735,III.,It was while at the ideal retreat at Butler's Bay that Freneau wrote
736,III.,"three of his most significant poems, ""Santa Cruz,"" ""The House of Night,"""
737,III.,"and ""The Jamaica Funeral,"" the first two of which were contributed to"
738,III.,"the _United States Magazine_ in 1779. Of these the ""House of Night"" is"
739,III.,"the most significant, containing as it does evidence of a high creative"
740,III.,"power and a romantic imagination, rare indeed in English poetry in 1776."
741,III.,There are evidences that Freneau composed the first draught of the poem
742,III.,"before leaving for the West Indies, but the point is not an important"
743,III.,"one. For the edition of 1786 he nearly doubled the original version,"
744,III.,"but in 1795 he cut it down to a few stanzas, taking from it nearly"
745,III.,everything which had made it a notable creation.
746,III.,
747,III.,"On April 1, 1778, Freneau sailed from Santa Cruz for the Bermuda"
748,III.,"Islands, where for a time he was the guest of the English Governor. In"
749,III.,"an elaborate letter to Brackenridge, dated Bermuda, May 10, afterward"
750,III.,"published in the _United States Magazine_, he describes at length the"
751,III.,"islands. ""These,"" he says in conclusion, ""are a few particulars"
752,III.,"concerning this little country where I resided upwards of five weeks,"
753,III.,"and if this slight description gives you any satisfaction, it will amply"
754,III.,"repay me for the fatigues I underwent in sailing thither."""
755,III.,
756,III.,On June 6th he was again in Santa Cruz; on the 15th he set out on his
757,III.,"homeward voyage, after an absence of nearly three years. The run home"
758,III.,was destined to be eventful. Off the Delaware capes the vessel was taken
759,III.,"by the British, but Freneau, being a passenger, was landed on July 9th"
760,III.,and allowed to go his way.
761,III.,
762,III.,"The young poet now retired to Mount Pleasant, where doubtless he quietly"
763,III.,"remained until the autumn of the following year. In August, 1778, he"
764,III.,"published with Bell in Philadelphia the pamphlet poem ""America"
765,III.,"Independent."" On January 1, 1779, Brackenridge issued in Philadelphia"
766,III.,"the first number of the _United States Magazine_,[6] and Freneau at once"
767,III.,became an important contributor. His work in prose and verse may be
768,III.,"found in nearly every number. There are prose papers on the West Indies,"
769,III.,"purporting to be extracts from the letters of ""a young philosopher and"
770,III.,_bel esprit_ just returned from several small voyages amongst these
771,III.,"islands."" There are several early poems for the first time put into"
772,III.,"print, like ""Columbus to Ferdinand"" and ""The Dying Elm,"" and there are"
773,III.,"several notable long poems, like ""Santa Cruz"" and ""The House of Night."""
774,III.,At least three of the poetical contributions were written expressly for
775,III.,"the magazine: ""George the Third's Soliloquy,"" ""Psalm cxxxvii"
776,III.,"Imitated,""--signed ""Monmouth, Sept. 10,""--and the ""Dialogue between"
777,III.,"George and Fox."" It is evident, however, that Freneau, though his work"
778,III.,"very greatly strengthened the periodical, was only a ""valued"
779,III.,"contributor."" The psalm in the September issue, the first of the poems"
780,III.,"to bear his name, had a foot-note explaining that the author was ""a"
781,III.,young gentleman to whom in the course of this work we are greatly
782,III.,"indebted."""
783,III.,
784,III.,The _United States Magazine_ is a notable landmark in American literary
785,III.,"history. Its methods, as we view them to-day, seem singularly modern,"
786,III.,and its materials and arrangement are indeed remarkable when we view
787,III.,"them against the background of their times. It was a spirited, intensely"
788,III.,"patriotic, and highly literary periodical; the single fact that ""The"
789,III.,"House of Night"" first appeared in its columns is enough to stamp it as"
790,III.,"no ordinary work. It died with its twelfth issue, owing to the troubled"
791,III.,"state of the country and the unsettled nature of the currency. Then,"
792,III.,"too, the audience to which it appealed was found to be a small one. In"
793,III.,his valedictory the editor complains bitterly of the unliterary
794,III.,"atmosphere in America. A large class, he declares, ""inhabit the region"
795,III.,"of stupidity, and cannot bear to have the tranquility of their repose"
796,III.,disturbed by the villanous shock of a book. Reading is to them the worst
797,III.,"of all torments, and I remember very well that at the commencement of"
798,III.,"the work it was their language, 'Art thou come to torment us before the"
799,III.,"time?' We will now say to them, 'Sleep on and take your rest.'"""
800,III.,
801,III.,"Late in September, 1779, Freneau shipped as super-cargo on the brig"
802,III.,"_Rebecca_, Captain Chatham, bound for the Azores. After an exciting"
803,III.,"voyage, during which they were several times chased by British ships,"
804,III.,"they arrived at Santa Cruz, in the island of Teneriffe, where they"
805,III.,remained two months. A part of Freneau's notebook during this voyage has
806,III.,been preserved. It shows him to have been a careful and conscientious
807,III.,"student of navigation, making each day an observation of his own and"
808,III.,minutely tabulating his results. His cash account with the crew during
809,III.,the stay in the islands is interesting and suggestive.
810,III.,
811,III.,"The early spring of 1780 was spent by the poet at the old home, but his"
812,III.,mind was evidently tossing upon the ocean. He longed to visit again his
813,III.,"beloved West Indies, and accordingly on the 25th of May he took passage"
814,III.,"at Philadelphia, in the ship _Aurora_, for St. Eustatia. Freneau's"
815,III.,account of this voyage and its after results is still extant.[7] A few
816,III.,quotations will tell the story.
817,III.,
818,III.,"""On the 25th of May, in beating down the Delaware Bay, we"
819,III.,unfortunately retook a small sloop from the refugees loaded with
820,III.,"corn, which hindered us from standing out to sea that night,"
821,III.,whereby in all probability we should have avoided the enemy which
822,III.,afterwards captured us.
823,III.,
824,III.,"""Friday morning, May 26. The air very smoky and the wind somewhat"
825,III.,"faintish, though it afterward freshened up. The wind was so that we"
826,III.,"stood off E.S.E., after putting the pilot on board the small sloop,"
827,III.,"handcuffing the prisoners, and sending the prize to Cape May."
828,III.,About three o'clock in the afternoon we discovered three sail
829,III.,bearing from us about E.N.E.; they were not more than five leagues
830,III.,from us when we discovered them from the foretop; at the same time
831,III.,we could see them from the quarter-deck. One appeared to be a
832,III.,"pretty large ship, the other two brigs. We soon found they were in"
833,III.,"chase of us; we therefore tacked immediately, set all sail we could"
834,III.,"crowd, and stood back from the bay. My advice to the officers was"
835,III.,"to stand for Egg Harbor or any part of the Jersey shore, and run"
836,III.,"the ship on the flats, rather than be taken; but this was"
837,III.,disregarded. We continued to stand in till we saw Cape Henlopen;
838,III.,"the frigate, in the meantime, gaining on us apace; sun about half"
839,III.,"an hour high. We were abreast of the Cape, close in, when the wind"
840,III.,"took us aback, and immediately after we were becalmed; the ebb of"
841,III.,"the tide at the same time setting very strong out of the bay, so"
842,III.,"that we rather drifted out. Our design was, if possible, to get"
843,III.,"within the road around the point, and then run the ship on shore;"
844,III.,"but want of wind and the tide being against us, hindered from"
845,III.,putting this into execution. We were now within three hundred yards
846,III.,of the shore. The frigate in the meantime ran in the bay to leeward
847,III.,of us about one-quarter of a mile (her distance from the Cape
848,III.,hindering it from becalming her as it did us) and began to bring
849,III.,her cannon to bear on us. Her two prizes hove to; one we knew to be
850,III.,"the brig _Active_, Captain Mesnard; the other, as we afterward"
851,III.,"learned, was a Salem brig from the West Indies. The frigate was the"
852,III.,"_Iris_, returning from Charleston to New York, with the express of"
853,III.,the former's being taken. We now began to fire upon each other at
854,III.,the distance of about three hundred yards. The frigate hulled us
855,III.,"several times. One shot went betwixt wind and water, which made the"
856,III.,"ship leak amazingly, making twenty-four inches in thirty minutes."
857,III.,"We found our four-pounders were but trifles against the frigate, so"
858,III.,"we got our nine-pounder, the only one we had, pointed from the"
859,III.,"cabin windows, with which we played upon the frigate for about half"
860,III.,"an hour. At last a twelve-pound shot came from the frigate, and,"
861,III.,"striking a parcel of oars lashed upon the starboard quarter, broke"
862,III.,"them all in two, and continuing its destructive course, struck"
863,III.,"Captain Laboyteaut in the right thigh, which it smashed to atoms,"
864,III.,tearing part of his belly open at the same time with the splinters
865,III.,"from the oars; he fell from the quarter-deck close by me, and for"
866,III.,some time seemed very busily engaged in setting his legs to rights.
867,III.,"He died about eleven the same night, and next day was sewed up in"
868,III.,his hammock and sunk. Every shot seemed now to bring ruin with it.
869,III.,A lad named Steel had his arm broken and some others complained of
870,III.,"slight wounds; whereupon, finding the frigate ready and in a"
871,III.,"position to give us a broadside, we struck, after having held a"
872,III.,very unequal contest with her for about an hour.... As soon as we
873,III.,"struck, one Squires with some midshipmen came on board and took"
874,III.,"possession of the vessel."""
875,III.,
876,III.,"Freneau at first supposed that, being a passenger, he would be taken"
877,III.,"with the prize to New York and there released; but despite his protests,"
878,III.,he was driven into the barge with the other prisoners and taken to the
879,III.,"_Iris_. All his baggage was left behind, and he was destined never to"
880,III.,"see it again. Arriving on board, the prisoners were driven between"
881,III.,"decks, where the air was hot and stifling."
882,III.,
883,III.,"""There were about one hundred prisoners forward, the stench of whom"
884,III.,was almost intolerable. So many melancholy sights and dismal
885,III.,countenances made it a pretty just representation of the infernal
886,III.,region. I marched through a torrent of cursing and blasphemy to my
887,III.,"station, viz., at the blacksmith's vice, where the miserable"
888,III.,prisoners were handcuffed two and two. At last it came my turn.
889,III.,"'Pray,' said I, 'is it your custom to handcuff passengers? The"
890,III.,"Americans, I am confident, never used the English so.'"
891,III.,
892,III.,"""'Are you a passenger?' said the blacksmith. At the same time"
893,III.,"happening to look up, I saw Hugh Ray looking steadily at me, who"
894,III.,"immediately seized my hand, and asked me how I did. 'Do you know"
895,III.,"him?' said Holmes, the master-at-arms. 'Then you are free from"
896,III.,irons; come over among the gentlemen.'
897,III.,
898,III.,"""This was an unexpected deliverance from a cursed disgrace which I"
899,III.,hardly knew how I should get clear of. After this I was used well
900,III.,"by everybody."""
901,III.,
902,III.,On the 29th the _Iris_ reached New York and the common prisoners were
903,III.,"sent to the prison ships in the harbor. Freneau, however, was retained"
904,III.,with the officers. He had been promised his liberty at the first
905,III.,"possible moment, but on Thursday, June 1st, at the Commissioner's"
906,III.,"office, the charge was brought by the second mate that Freneau had been"
907,III.,among those stationed at the guns during the fight. He was refused
908,III.,"parole, though he promised security in any amount up to ten thousand"
909,III.,"pounds, and the same day was placed on board the _Scorpion_ prison ship,"
910,III.,"""lying off the college in the North River."""
911,III.,
912,III.,Freneau's experiences during his stay upon the _Scorpion_ have been
913,III.,"described by him in graphic style in his poem, ""The Prison Ship."""
914,III.,
915,III.,"""On the night of June 4th, thirty-five of the prisoners formed a"
916,III.,"design of making their escape, in which they were favored by a"
917,III.,large schooner accidentally alongside of us. She was one that was
918,III.,"destined for the expedition to Elizabeth Town, and anchored just"
919,III.,"astern of us. We were then suffered to continue upon deck, if we"
920,III.,"chose, till nine o'clock. We were all below at that time except the"
921,III.,"insurgents, who rushed upon the sentries and disarmed them in a"
922,III.,"moment; one they tied by his neck-stock to the quarter rails, and"
923,III.,carried off his musquet with them (they were all Hessians); the
924,III.,rest they drove down with their arms into the cabin and rammed the
925,III.,sentry box down the companion in such a manner that no one could
926,III.,"get it up or down. One, Murphy, possessed himself of Gauzoo's"
927,III.,"silver-hilted sword, and carried it off with him. When the sentries"
928,III.,"were all silent, they manned the ship's boat and boarded the"
929,III.,"schooner, though the people on board attempted to keep them off"
930,III.,with handspikes. The wind blowing fresh at south and the flood of
931,III.,"tide being made, they hoisted sail and were out of sight in a few"
932,III.,"minutes. Those particulars we learned from some who were on duty,"
933,III.,but were unsuccessful in getting into the boat. As soon as the
934,III.,"sentries got possession of the vessel again, which they had no"
935,III.,"difficulty in doing, as there was no resistance made, they posted"
936,III.,themselves at each hatchway and most basely and cowardly fired fore
937,III.,"and aft among us, pistols and musquets, for a full quarter of an"
938,III.,hour without intermission. By the mercy of God they touched but
939,III.,"four, one mortally.... After this no usage seemed severe enough for"
940,III.,"us."""
941,III.,
942,III.,"On June 22d, Freneau, who was weak with fever, was taken to the _Hunter_"
943,III.,"hospital ship, lying in the East River. Here he languished with an"
944,III.,"intermittent fever, that threatened constantly to become ""putrid"" and"
945,III.,"fatal, until July 12th, when:"
946,III.,
947,III.,"""The flag came alongside and cleared the hospital ship. But the"
948,III.,miseries we endured in getting to Elizabeth Town were many. Those
949,III.,"that were very bad, of which the proportion was great, naturally"
950,III.,took possession of the hold. No prisoner was allowed to go to the
951,III.,"cabin, so that I, with twenty or thirty others, were obliged to"
952,III.,"sleep out all night, which was uncommonly cold for the season."
953,III.,"About ten next morning we arrived at Elizabeth Town Point, where we"
954,III.,"were kept in the burning sun several hours, till the Commissary"
955,III.,came to discharge us.
956,III.,
957,III.,"""I was afflicted with such pains in my joints, I could scarcely"
958,III.,"walk, and besides was weakened with a raging fever; nevertheless I"
959,III.,walked two miles to Elizabeth Town; here I got a passage in a wagon
960,III.,"to within a mile of Crow's Ferry, which I walked; got a passage"
961,III.,"over the ferry and walked on as far as Molly Budleigh's, where I"
962,III.,"stayed all night. Next morning, having breakfasted on some bread"
963,III.,"and milk, I set homeward; when I came to Obadiah Budleigh's corner"
964,III.,"I turned to the right and came home round about through the woods,"
965,III.,for fear of terrifying the neighbors with my ghastly looks had I
966,III.,"gone through Mount Pleasant."""
967,III.,
968,III.,Some days later he despatched the following note to his friend at Santa
969,III.,Cruz:
970,III.,
971,III.,"""SIR:--I take this opportunity to inform you that instead of"
972,III.,"arriving, as I fondly promised myself, at the fragrant groves and"
973,III.,"delectable plains of Santa Cruz, to enjoy the fruits and flowers of"
974,III.,"that happy clime, I was unfortunately taken and confined on board a"
975,III.,"prison ship at New York, and afterwards in a Hospital Ship, where"
976,III.,the damnable draughts of a German doctor afforded far different
977,III.,feelings to my stomach than the juice of the orange or more
978,III.,"nourishing milk of the cocoa."""
979,III.,
980,III.,
981,IV.,IV.
982,IV.,
983,IV.,"On April 25, 1781, there was established in Philadelphia a new weekly"
984,IV.,"newspaper, the _Freeman's Journal or North American Intelligencer_,"
985,IV.,"which was to be ""open to all parties but influenced by none,"" and which"
986,IV.,"had for its object ""To encourage genius, to deter vice, and disrobe"
987,IV.,"tyranny and misrule of every plumage."" The proprietor and printer of"
988,IV.,"this paper was Mr. Francis Bailey, who not long before had removed his"
989,IV.,"office from Lancaster, Pa. The editor and ruling spirit, although his"
990,IV.,"name during three years did not once appear in its columns, was Philip"
991,IV.,Freneau. The mark of the young poet is upon every page. Its opening
992,IV.,"editorial, which was from his pen, sounded a note that was not once"
993,IV.,lowered or weakened while he was in control.
994,IV.,
995,IV.,"""At no period of time, in no era of important events from the first"
996,IV.,"establishment of social government, have the liberties of man, have"
997,IV.,"the rights even of human nature, been more deeply interested than"
998,IV.,"at the time in which we presume to address you. While Liberty, the"
999,IV.,"noblest ornament of society, and without which no community can be"
1000,IV.,"well organized, seemed to pine and sicken under the trammels of"
1001,IV.,despotic restraint in every one of the ancient nations of the
1002,IV.,"earth, it fairly promises to resume its pristine majesty here, and"
1003,IV.,the new world begins to emerge from the fangs and tyranny of the
1004,IV.,old.... One of the first sources of her decline in those countries
1005,IV.,where she last resided spring from the wanton and unhallowed
1006,IV.,restraints which the jealous arm of despotism hath imposed on the
1007,IV.,freedom of the press....
1008,IV.,
1009,IV.,"""That freemen may be made acquainted with the real state of their"
1010,IV.,"affairs, and that the characters of their public servants, both"
1011,IV.,"individually and collectively, be made manifest, is our object."
1012,IV.,"With this patriotic view, and under the tutelage of law and the"
1013,IV.,"constitution, has the subscriber opened a Free Press, universally"
1014,IV.,"free to every citizen indiscriminately, whose principles coincide"
1015,IV.,"with those of the Revolution, and whose object is confessedly known"
1016,IV.,"to point at public or private good."""
1017,IV.,
1018,IV.,"From this time until June, 1784, Freneau resided principally in"
1019,IV.,"Philadelphia, and edited the journal. During all of this time his muse"
1020,IV.,"was exceedingly active. He followed carefully the last years of the war,"
1021,IV.,"and put into satiric verse every movement of the ""insolent foe."" He sang"
1022,IV.,"the victory of Jones, and mourned in plaintive numbers the dead at Eutaw"
1023,IV.,Springs. He voiced his indignation over the destructive career of
1024,IV.,"Cornwallis, and burst into a _Laus Deo_ at his fall. The ludicrous"
1025,IV.,"plight of Rivington and Gaine, the distress of the Tories, and the final"
1026,IV.,"departure of the British filled him with glee, which he poured out in"
1027,IV.,song after song. It was his most prolific and spontaneous period.
1028,IV.,
1029,IV.,"He wrote, too, an abundance of prose. The series of graceful papers"
1030,IV.,"entitled ""The Pilgrim"" is from his pen, besides many a political study"
1031,IV.,and literary sketch signed with a sounding name. Everywhere are manifest
1032,IV.,his love of true literature and his desire to lead a merely literary
1033,IV.,"life, but here and there are notes of discouragement. ""Barbers cannot"
1034,IV.,"possibly exist as such,"" he writes, ""among a people who have neither"
1035,IV.,"hair nor beards. How, then, can a poet hope for success in a city where"
1036,IV.,"there are not three persons possessed of elegant ideas?"""
1037,IV.,
1038,IV.,During the year 1783 Freneau's pen was very busy in various lines of
1039,IV.,"work. It is probable that he assisted Bailey in many ways,--writing"
1040,IV.,introductions to publications issued by the office and performing the
1041,IV.,various other duties incumbent upon the literary editor of a publishing
1042,IV.,"house. During this year he translated the ""New Travels through North"
1043,IV.,"America,"" which had just been issued by the Abbé Robin, one of the"
1044,IV.,"chaplains of the French Army in America, and the translation was issued"
1045,IV.,first by Bailey and later by Powers and Willis of Boston. Freneau's
1046,IV.,introduction is characteristic:
1047,IV.,
1048,IV.,"""Most of those accounts of North America, given to the public by"
1049,IV.,"British explorators and others, previous to the Revolution, are"
1050,IV.,"generally taken up, with the recitals of wonderful adventures, in"
1051,IV.,"the woods beyond the Lakes, or with the Histories and records of"
1052,IV.,"the wild Indian nations, so that by the time the reader gets"
1053,IV.,"through one of those performances, he never fails to be better"
1054,IV.,"acquainted with the _Ottagnies_, _Chereokees_, _Miamees_,"
1055,IV.,"_Nadouwessians_, and a hundred others, with their various customs"
1056,IV.,"of _paw-wawing_, or methods of making _wampum_, than with the most"
1057,IV.,interesting particulars relative to the _inhabitants_ of the then
1058,IV.,colonies _these_ were but rarely thought worthy mentioning by those
1059,IV.,"gentlemen, and when they are, it is mortifying enough to see them"
1060,IV.,"constantly considered as mere beasts of burden, calculated solely"
1061,IV.,"for the support of the grandeur, wealth and omnipotence of"
1062,IV.,"Great-Britain, than as men and Free-Men."
1063,IV.,
1064,IV.,"""Our French Author is more liberal--two years before the present"
1065,IV.,peace he considered the United States as a great independent
1066,IV.,"nation, advancing with hasty strides to the summit of power and"
1067,IV.,"sovereignty."""
1068,IV.,
1069,IV.,"It was during this year that the poet, for the first time, met with"
1070,IV.,"positive opposition and abuse. Oswald, the editor of the newly"
1071,IV.,"established _Gazette_, quarrelled with Bailey, and a poetical battle was"
1072,IV.,one phase of the contest. The details of this affair will be found in
1073,IV.,"the proper place, and I need not recount them here, but suffice it to"
1074,IV.,say that Freneau soon found his muse assailed by the meanest of all
1075,IV.,critics. His extremely sensitive nature could brook no criticism. His
1076,IV.,"Celtic temperament could fight fiercely in the presence of an open foe,"
1077,IV.,but it was easily depressed and discouraged by criticism and covert
1078,IV.,"attack. He lost heart in his work, and at the end of the third volume he"
1079,IV.,quietly withdrew from his editorship.
1080,IV.,
1081,IV.,The three volumes of the _Journal_ which bear his impress are notable
1082,IV.,"for their vigor of policy, their high ideals, their unswerving"
1083,IV.,"patriotism, and their real literary merit. It is to be hoped that a"
1084,IV.,selection from Freneau's prose writings during this critical era in our
1085,IV.,history may sometime be made. Nowhere else can we gain so distinct a
1086,IV.,"picture of the man, with his sanguine, impetuous temperament, his proud"
1087,IV.,"spirit, and his intense hatred of every form of tyranny. He wrote"
1088,IV.,"vigorously not only on British oppression, but on such topics as the"
1089,IV.,"wrongs of negro slavery, cruelty to animals, the wanton destruction of"
1090,IV.,"trees, the evils of intemperance, and the rights of woman."
1091,IV.,
1092,IV.,"The ""Epistle to Sylvius"" was his valedictory. In it he deplores the lack"
1093,IV.,"of literary taste in America, and the sad fate which has befallen his"
1094,IV.,"youthful poetic dreams. The age is grown mercantile, and Sejanus the"
1095,IV.,"mighty tradesman,--"
1096,IV.,
1097,IV.,"""Sejanus has in house declared"
1098,IV.,"'These States, as yet, can boast no bard,"
1099,IV.,And all the sing-song of our clime
1100,IV.,"Is merely nonsense fringed with rhyme.'"""
1101,IV.,
1102,IV.,"A bard with more Teutonic blood, if he knew within himself that he was"
1103,IV.,"indeed a poet, and the only real poet of his time, would have staid at"
1104,IV.,"his post and made himself heard, despite narrow criticism and mean"
1105,IV.,"abuse, but Freneau was too proud to fight for recognition. The people"
1106,IV.,"had crowned him, to be sure, but if the critics, those who should be the"
1107,IV.,"real judges, rejected him, he would strive no longer. He would leave the"
1108,IV.,field.
1109,IV.,
1110,IV.,"""Then, Sylvius, come--let you and I"
1111,IV.,"On Neptune's aid, once more rely:"
1112,IV.,Perhaps the muse may still impart
1113,IV.,The balm to ease the aching heart.
1114,IV.,"Though cold might chill and storms dismay,"
1115,IV.,"Yet Zoilus will be far away."""
1116,IV.,
1117,IV.,"On June 24, 1784, Freneau sailed from Middletown Point as master of the"
1118,IV.,"brig _Dromilly_, bound for Jamaica. The voyage was indeed a memorable"
1119,IV.,"one. On the night of July 30, while off the end of the island, the ship"
1120,IV.,"encountered a violent hurricane. According to contemporary accounts, ""No"
1121,IV.,more than eight out of one hundred and fifty sail of vessels in the
1122,IV.,"ports of Kingston and Port Royal were saved."" The _Dromilly_ survived"
1123,IV.,"the storm, but it was a mere wreck when the next morning it crept into"
1124,IV.,Kingston Harbor.
1125,IV.,
1126,IV.,"Freneau remained in Jamaica until September 24, when he left for"
1127,IV.,"Philadelphia in the brig _Mars_, arriving November 4. His experiences in"
1128,IV.,"trying to fit out the wrecked _Dromilly_ are not recorded, but the one"
1129,IV.,"incident of his poetic reply to the keeper of the King's water works,"
1130,IV.,"who had refused him a puncheon of water, is characteristic."
1131,IV.,
1132,IV.,"From this time until 1790, Freneau's life is redolent of the ocean. A"
1133,IV.,complete itinerary of this wandering era may be compiled from the
1134,IV.,"shipping news of the various seaport newspapers, but it is useless to go"
1135,IV.,"into details. He was master for a time of the sloop _Monmouth_, plying"
1136,IV.,"for freight between Charleston, S. C., New York, and Savannah. His"
1137,IV.,"brother Peter, in Charleston, had become a man not only of influence,"
1138,IV.,"but of means, and together they owned the vessel and shared its profits."
1139,IV.,For several years advertisements like this appeared in the Charleston
1140,IV.,papers:
1141,IV.,
1142,IV.,"""For freight to any part of this State or Georgia; for charter in"
1143,IV.,"any free port in the West Indies, the sloop _Monmouth_, Philip"
1144,IV.,"Freneau, Master, burden about 40 tons. She is new, stanch,"
1145,IV.,well-formed and draws six feet when loaded. Will carry about one
1146,IV.,hundred barrels of rice. For further particulars inquire of said
1147,IV.,"master on board at Mrs. Motte's wharf or Peter Freneau."""
1148,IV.,
1149,IV.,"On the 1st of June, 1786, there was issued from Bailey's press the first"
1150,IV.,collected edition of Freneau's poetry. During the entire year its author
1151,IV.,was at sea almost continuously. It is evident that he had little to do
1152,IV.,with the edition. The copy furnished to Bailey consisted of the
1153,IV.,"manuscript of a few early poems, revised copies of the 1775 pamphlets,"
1154,IV.,and corrected and enlarged versions of his contributions to the _United
1155,IV.,States Magazine_. The bulk of the book is made up of Freneau's
1156,IV.,"contributions to the _Freeman's Journal_, printed _seriatim_ and without"
1157,IV.,"change. The poem ""Rivington's Confessions"" is even divided into two"
1158,IV.,"parts, with another poem between, as it first appeared in the paper. An"
1159,IV.,index of the poetry in the first four volumes of the _Journal_ is a
1160,IV.,"nearly perfect index of the 1786 edition, after the poem ""The Prison"
1161,IV.,"Ship."""
1162,IV.,
1163,IV.,Bailey wrote for the edition the following introduction:
1164,IV.,
1165,IV.,"""The pieces now collected and printed in the following sheets, were"
1166,IV.,"left in my hands, by the author, above a year ago, with permission"
1167,IV.,to publish them whenever I thought proper. A considerable number of
1168,IV.,"the performances contained in this volume, as many will recollect,"
1169,IV.,have appeared at different times in Newspapers (particularly the
1170,IV.,Freeman's Journal) and other periodical publications in the
1171,IV.,"different States of America, during the late war, and since; and"
1172,IV.,from the avidity and pleasure with which they generally appear to
1173,IV.,"have been read by persons of the best taste, the Printer now the"
1174,IV.,"more readily gives them to the world in their present form,"
1175,IV.,(without troubling the reader with any affected apologies for their
1176,IV.,supposed or real imperfections) in hopes they will afford a high
1177,IV.,"degree of satisfaction to the lovers of poetical wit, and elegance"
1178,IV.,"of expression."""
1179,IV.,
1180,IV.,This edition is the most spontaneous and poetic of the poet's works. In
1181,IV.,"it we see Freneau before he has lost his early poetic dream, before he"
1182,IV.,has become hardened by close contact with the world of affairs and the
1183,IV.,"cold, practical round of political life. This and the 1788 edition"
1184,IV.,contain by far the most valuable part of his poetic work.
1185,IV.,
1186,IV.,"In those days before the invention of book reviews, the fate of a book"
1187,IV.,turned largely upon its immediate reception by the reading public.
1188,IV.,Criticism was by word of mouth: the poems were discussed in polite
1189,IV.,circles and over the morning coffee. Thus we have nothing to quote to
1190,IV.,"show how America received her bard. We know, however, that the poems"
1191,IV.,were successful even beyond Bailey's expectations. In less than five
1192,IV.,"months he was out with proposals for ""an additional collection of"
1193,IV.,entertaining original performances in prose and verse by Philip
1194,IV.,"Freneau."" The book was to be published as soon as five hundred"
1195,IV.,"subscribers could be secured, and the subscribers' names were to be"
1196,IV.,printed at the beginning of the volume.
1197,IV.,
1198,IV.,"""Such persons as are disposed to encourage American authors"
1199,IV.,(particularly at a time when we are surfeited with stale
1200,IV.,publications retailed to us from British presses) and are not
1201,IV.,unwilling to be known as promoters of polite literature and the
1202,IV.,fine arts in these Republican States are requested to deliver in
1203,IV.,"their names."""
1204,IV.,
1205,IV.,"One bit of contemporary praise, however, has been preserved. On June"
1206,IV.,"8th, one week after the appearance of Freneau's first volume, Col. Parke"
1207,IV.,"of Philadelphia composed the following, which was first published in the"
1208,IV.,"_Journal_ of June 21st, and afterward included in his volume of ""The"
1209,IV.,"Lyric Works of Horace, ... to which are added a Number of Original"

1282,IV.,of the United Slates in hopes they will prove at least equally
1283,IV.,acceptable with his volume of poems published last year. Some few
1284,IV.,of the pieces in this volume have heretofore appeared in American
1285,IV.,"newspapers; but through a fatality, not unusually attending"
1286,IV.,"publications of that kind, are now, perhaps, forgotten; and, at any"
1287,IV.,"time, may possibly never have been seen or attended to but by very"
1288,IV.,"few."""
1289,IV.,
1290,IV.,"Of the forty-nine poems in the volume, one, ""Slender's Journey,"" had"
1291,IV.,"been published separately by Bailey early in 1787, and nearly half of"

1293,IV.,"1788, in the columns of the _Freeman's Journal_. The greater number of"
1294,IV.,the others were doubtless printed from the poet's manuscripts. A few of

1311,IV.,
1312,IV.,"""I have the mortification to inform you that, after leaving"
1313,IV.,"New-York on the 21st of July, I had the misfortune to have my"
1314,IV.,"vessel dismasted, thrown on her beam ends, shifted and ruined the"
1315,IV.,"bulk of her cargo, lost every sail, mast, spar, boat, and almost"
1316,IV.,"every article upon deck, on the Wednesday afternoon following, in"
1317,IV.,one of the hardest gales that ever blew upon this coast. Capt.
1318,IV.,"William Cannon, whom I think you know, who was going passenger with"
1319,IV.,"me to Charleston, and Mr. Joseph Stillwell, a lad of a reputable"
1320,IV.,"family in New-Jersey, were both washed overboard and drowned,"
1321,IV.,"notwithstanding every effort to save them. All my people besides,"
1322,IV.,"except one, an old man who stuck fast in one of the scuttles, were"
1323,IV.,"several times overboard, but had the fortune to regain the wreck,"
1324,IV.,"and with considerable difficulty save their lives.--As to myself, I"
1325,IV.,found the vessel no longer under any guidance--I took refuge in the
1326,IV.,"main weather shrouds, where indeed I saved myself from being washed"
1327,IV.,"into the sea, but was almost staved to pieces in a violent fall I"
1328,IV.,"had upon the main deck, the main-mast having given way six feet"
1329,IV.,"above the deck, and gone overboard--I was afterward knocked in the"
1330,IV.,"head by a violent stroke of the tiller, which entirely deprived me"
1331,IV.,of sensation for (I was told) near a quarter of an hour.--Our pumps
1332,IV.,"were now so choaked with corn that they would no longer work,"
1333,IV.,"upward of four feet of water was in the hold, fortunately our"
1334,IV.,"bucket was saved, and with this we went to baling, which alone"
1335,IV.,prevented us from foundering in one of the most dismal nights that
1336,IV.,ever man witnessed.
1337,IV.,
1338,IV.,"""The next morning the weather had cleared away and the wind came"
1339,IV.,round to the N. E. which during the gale had been E. N. E.--the
1340,IV.,"land was then in sight, about 5 miles distant, latitude at noon"
1341,IV.,"36-17, I then rigged out a broken boom, and set the fore top-sail,"
1342,IV.,"the only sail remaining, and steered for cape Henry; making however"
1343,IV.,"but very little way, the vessel being very much on one side and"
1344,IV.,"ready to sink with her heavy cargo of iron, besides other weighty"
1345,IV.,"articles. We were towed in next day, Friday, by the friendly"
1346,IV.,"assistance of capt. Archibald Bell, of the ship Betsey, from"
1347,IV.,London--I have since arrived at this port by the assistance of a
1348,IV.,"Potowmac pilot.--Nothing could exceed our distress--no fire, no"
1349,IV.,"candle, our beds soaked with sea water, the cabbin torn to pieces,"
1350,IV.,"a vast quantity of corn damaged and poisoning us to death, &c. &c."
1351,IV.,"&c. As we entered this port, on the 29th of July, the very dogs"
1352,IV.,"looked at us with an eye of commiseration--the negros pitied us,"
1353,IV.,and almost every one shewed a disposition to relieve us. In the
1354,IV.,midst of all this vexation the crew endeavoured to keep up their
1355,IV.,"spirits with a little grog, while I have recourse to my old"
1356,IV.,"expedient of philosophy and reflection. I have unloaded my cargo,"
1357,IV.,"partly damaged, partly otherwise--This day I also begin to refit my"
1358,IV.,"vessel, and mean to proceed back to New-York as soon as refitted,"
1359,IV.,"which cannot be sooner than the 25th, perhaps the 30th of this"
1360,IV.,"month. It is possible, however, that I may be ordered to sell the"
1361,IV.,"vessel here; if so, I shall take a passage to Baltimore, and go to"
1362,IV.,"New-York by the way of Philadelphia, to look out for another more"
1363,IV.,fortunate barque than that which I now command.

1366,IV.,
1367,IV.,"I cannot forbear quoting another letter[9] written nearly a year later,"
1368,IV.,since it gives us a charming glimpse of the Freneau of this period:
1369,IV.,
1370,IV.,"""Yamacraw, Savanna, March 14th, 1789."
1371,IV.,
1372,IV.,"""SIR: Amongst a number of my good natured acquaintance, who have"
1373,IV.,"lately sympathized with me, on account of what they term my"
1374,IV.,"misfortunes, during great part of last year, I know of no one more"
1375,IV.,"entitled to my acknowledgments, on the occasion, than yourself."
1376,IV.,"When an old woman talks of witches, ghosts, or blue devils, we"
1377,IV.,"naturally make an allowance for bad education, or the imbicility of"
1378,IV.,"intellect, occasioned by age. When one man seriously supposes"
1379,IV.,"another unfortunate, for the sake of two or three successive"
1380,IV.,"disasters, which no prudence or foresight could have avoided, the"
1381,IV.,"same allowance ought to be made, provided the same excuses could be"
1382,IV.,assigned.
1383,IV.,
1384,IV.,"""Can you be serious, then in advising me to quit all future"
1385,IV.,"intercourse with an element, that has for some years, with all its"
1386,IV.,"dangers and losses, afforded to your humble servant attractions,"
1387,IV.,"far more powerful than those of Apollo! Formerly, when I wrote"
1388,IV.,"poetry, most of those that attended to it, would not allow my"
1389,IV.,verses to be good. I gave credit to what I deemed the popular
1390,IV.,"opinion, and made a safe retreat in due time, to the solitary"
1391,IV.,"wastes of Neptune. I am not, however, inclined to believe people so"
1392,IV.,"readily now, when they alledge my vessel is not sound, and when"
1393,IV.,"several gentlemen, for reasons best known to themselves, and"
1394,IV.,perhaps not over willing to risque the uncertainties of the world
1395,IV.,"to come, effect to doubt of her ability to waft their carcases in"
1396,IV.,safety.
1397,IV.,
1398,IV.,But my ambition is greatly concerned in this matter: a schooner is
1399,IV.,"confided to my care, humble, indeed, when compared to those lofty"
1400,IV.,"piles which I have seen you so much admire, but which is,"
1401,IV.,"nevertheless, really capable of an European, nay of an India"
1402,IV.,"voyage. Read all history, ransack libraries, call tradition to your"
1403,IV.,"aid, search all records, examine a million of manuscripts on"
1404,IV.,"vellum, on parchment, on paper, on marble, on what you please, and"
1405,IV.,"I defy you to find the most distant hint of any _poet_, in any age"
1406,IV.,"or country, from Hesiod down to Peter Pindar, having been trusted"
1407,IV.,with the controul or possession of anything fit to be mentioned or
1408,IV.,"compared with the same barque, which you say, _I have the"
1409,IV.,misfortune to command._
1410,IV.,
1411,IV.,"""To be serious: misfortune ought to be only the topic of such men"
1412,IV.,"as do not think or reason with propriety, upon the nature of"
1413,IV.,"things. Some writer says, it is but another name for carelessness"
1414,IV.,"or inattention: Though that may not at all times be the case, it is"
1415,IV.,in the power of every man to place himself beyond the supposed
1416,IV.,"baneful influence of this inexorable deity, by _assuming_ a dignity"
1417,IV.,"of mind, (if it be not the gift of nature) that will, in the end,"
1418,IV.,"get the better of the untoward events, that may frequently cross"
1419,IV.,"our best purposes. Indeed, the _sea_ is the _best_ school for"
1420,IV.,philosophy (I mean of the moral kind); in thirteen or fourteen
1421,IV.,"years' acquaintance with this element, I am convinced a man ought"
1422,IV.,"to imbibe more of your right genuine _stoical_ stuff, than could be"
1423,IV.,"gained in half a century on shore.--I must add that, be our"
1424,IV.,"occupations what they may, or our fortunes what they will, there is"
1425,IV.,"a certain delectable, inexpressible satisfaction in now and then"
1426,IV.,"encountering the rubs and disasters of life, and I am entirely of"
1427,IV.,the opinion which (says Dr. Langhorne)

1433,IV.,"""I must now conclude this scrawl, with telling you, that I am"
1434,IV.,"receiving on board my vessel a small cargo of lumber, at a place"
1435,IV.,"called Yamacraw, a little above Savanna. The weather is extremely"
1436,IV.,"warm, I am tired of my letter, and must, of course, conclude. I do"
1437,IV.,not know whether you ever mean to make a voyage to sea--if you
1438,IV.,"should, thrice welcome shall you be to such accommodations as my"
1439,IV.,"little embarkation affords. Poets and philosophers, shall ever"
1440,IV.,travel with me at a cheap rate indeed! Not only because they are
1441,IV.,"not generally men of this world, but because, even supposing the"
1442,IV.,"barque that bears them, should make an external exit to the bottom"
1443,IV.,"of the ocean, the busy world, as things go, will regret the loss of"
1444,IV.,"most of them very little, perhaps not at all."

1447,IV.,
1448,IV.,"On the 24th of April, 1789, when Washington arrived in New York to enter"
1449,IV.,"upon the duties of the presidency, in the fleet that accompanied him"
1450,IV.,"from Elizabethtown Point was the schooner _Columbia_, Capt. Freneau,"
1451,IV.,eight days from Charleston. In June the _Columbia_ again entered New
1452,IV.,"York Harbor, and on December 28th she was at Sunbury, Georgia. On"
1453,IV.,"February 12th, 1790, Freneau arrived in New York, passenger from"
1454,IV.,"Middletown Point in the brig _Betsy_, Capt. Motley, to become editor of"
1455,IV.,Child and Swaine's _New York Daily Advertiser_. For several months
1456,IV.,negotiations had been pending. Every appearance of the poet in New York
1457,IV.,for a year past had been marked by a small budget of poems in the
1458,IV.,"_Advertiser_ from the pen of ""Capt. Freneau,"" but it was not until"
1459,IV.,"February, 1790, that he was induced to leave his beloved _Columbia_ and"
1460,IV.,"settle down to a life upon shore. The poem ""Neversink,"" written some"
1461,IV.,"months later, is his valedictory to the ocean."

1472,IV.,
1473,IV.,"The poem ""Constantia"" may record the poet's reasons for leaving the"
1474,IV.,"ocean, for on the 19th of May, 1790, there appeared in Peter Freneau's"
1475,IV.,"Charleston paper, the _City Gazette_, _or the Daily Advertiser_, the"
1476,IV.,following:
1477,IV.,
1478,IV.,"""_Married_, on the fifteenth of April, at Middletown Point, East"
1479,IV.,"New Jersey, Capt. Philip Freneau to Miss Eleanor Forman, daughter"
1480,IV.,"of Mr. Samuel Forman, of that place."""
1481,IV.,
1482,IV.,The Forman family with which the poet allied himself was one of great
1483,IV.,respectability and even prominence in New Jersey. Its record during the
1484,IV.,"Revolution had been a conspicuous one, and its connection included the"
1485,IV.,"Ledyards, the Seymours, and many other prominent families. Mrs. Freneau,"
1486,IV.,"in the words of her daughter, ""was remarkable for her gentle, lady-like"
1487,IV.,"manners, amiable disposition and finely informed mind. She was affable"
1488,IV.,"and sprightly in her conversation, and there were, even when she had"
1489,IV.,"reached the advanced age of eighty-seven, few handsomer women."" In her"
1490,IV.,"early years she dabbled a little in poetry herself, and there is a"
1491,IV.,tradition in the family that the prenuptial correspondence was for a
1492,IV.,long time wholly in verse.
1493,IV.,
1494,IV.,"Freneau was now fairly settled in life, and for the next seven or eight"
1495,IV.,years he was engaged almost continuously in newspaper work.
1496,IV.,

1498,V.,V.
1499,V.,
1500,V.,"During the next year and more Freneau, as editor of the _Daily"
1501,V.,"Advertiser_, brought to bear upon the paper all the vigor and literary"
1502,V.,skill which had so marked the _Freeman's Journal_. The tone of the
1503,V.,"editorial comment was patriotic and spirited. The note of reform, of"
1504,V.,"opposition to everything that was degrading to high ideals, or that in"
1505,V.,"any way threatened personal liberty, was never absent. Despite the"
1506,V.,"manifold duties incumbent upon the editor of a city daily, he found time"
1507,V.,to write finished prose sketches and to woo the muses. His poetry of
1508,V.,this period is notable both as to quantity and quality. Some of it was
1509,V.,"drawn from the notebooks of his years of wandering, but the greater part"
1510,V.,dealt with more timely topics. In June he published the advertisement:
1511,V.,
1512,V.,"""Mr. Freneau proposes publishing a volume of original poems, to"
1513,V.,"contain about two hundred and fifty pages, 12mo, neatly"
1514,V.,printed.... As soon as there appears a sufficiency of subscribers
1515,V.,"to defray the expenses of paper and printing, the collection shall"
1516,V.,"be put to press."""
1517,V.,
1518,V.,Judging from several poems of this period which were printed as from the
1519,V.,"author's new volume, ""The Rising Empire,"" this was to be the title of"
1520,V.,"the book. The advertisement was dropped in October, and ""The Rising"
1521,V.,"Empire"" never appeared, though most of its poems were printed in the"
1522,V.,edition of 1795.
1523,V.,
1524,V.,"On September 20, 1791, Freneau's daughter, Eleanor, was born at Mount"
1525,V.,Pleasant. His salary as editor of the _Advertiser_ was not large; the
1526,V.,"little family, it appears, was in straightened circumstances. A"
1527,V.,"letter[10] from Aedanus Burke of Charleston to Madison, dated September"
1528,V.,"13, 1801, throws light upon the period."
1529,V.,
1530,V.,"""I remember, it was about the last fortnight that we served"
1531,V.,"together in Congress, in 1791, I one day called you aside, and"
1532,V.,"mentioned the name of Mr. Phillip Freneau to you, as one I knew you"
1533,V.,"esteemed, and then lay strugling under difficulties, with his"
1534,V.,"family. My memory brings to my recollection, that you mentioned the"
1535,V.,"matter to the Secretary of State, Mr. Jefferson. Freneau was"
1536,V.,"invited from N. York, and had the place of interpreter, with a mere"
1537,V.,"trifle of Salary. Little did William Smith know, that you were the"
1538,V.,author or cause of bringing Freneau from New York; or he might
1539,V.,"have turned against you, his terrible battery of the slanders and"
1540,V.,invectives which he poured forth against Mr. Jefferson for three or
1541,V.,"four years afterwards."""
1542,V.,
1543,V.,"Madison acted promptly. On the 28th of February, 1791, Jefferson wrote"
1544,V.,to Freneau as follows:
1545,V.,
1546,V.,"""SIR: The clerkship for foreign languages in my office is vacant"
1547,V.,"the salary indeed is very low, being but two hundred & fifty"
1548,V.,dollars a year; but also it gives so little to do as not to
1549,V.,"interfere with any other calling the person may chuse, which would"
1550,V.,not absent him from the seat of government. I was told a few days
1551,V.,"ago that it might perhaps be convenient to you to accept it--if so,"
1552,V.,it is at your service. It requires no other qualification than a
1553,V.,moderate knowledge of the French. Should anything better turn up
1554,V.,"within my department that might suit you, I should be very happy to"
1555,V.,"bestow it as well. Should you conclude to accept the present, you"
1556,V.,"may consider it as engaged to you, only be so good as to drop me a"

1651,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","arrangement were neat and attractive; its news columns were well filled,"
1652,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",and its literary department was carefully attended to. Its success was
1653,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","all that had been predicted by Madison. On May 7, 1792, the editor"
1654,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",announced that the subscription to the _Gazette_ had succeeded beyond
1655,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",his most sanguine expectations.
1656,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1657,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",The period covered by the two years of the _National Gazette_ was one of
1658,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",singular unrest in America. The French Revolution was in progress;
1659,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",everything seemed tottering. America believed that all Europe was soon
1660,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",to cast off its chains of monarch; she believed that the torch of the
1661,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Rights of Man had been lighted in America, and she looked with almost"
1662,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",paternal interest on the progress of the Revolution. In his poetical
1663,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","salutatory in the first number of the _Gazette_, Freneau writes:"
1664,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1665,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","""From the spark that we kindled, a flame has gone forth"
1666,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",To astonish the world and enlighten mankind:
1667,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","With a code of new doctrines the universe rings,"
1668,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","And Paine is addressing strange sermons to Kings."""
1669,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1670,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",The columns of the _Gazette_ are full of ringing words on the Rights of
1671,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Man, the Age of Reason, the final doom of monarchy. In poem after poem"
1672,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",the editor pours out his sympathy for republicanism and the cause of the
1673,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",French insurgents. That the French had been largely instrumental in the
1674,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","gaining of our own independence, increased the interest. ""On the"
1675,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Fourteenth of July,"" ""On the French Republicans,"" ""On the Anniversary of"
1676,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","the Storming of the Bastile,"" ""Ode to Liberty,"" and ""Demolition of the"
1677,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","French Monarchy,"" are a few of the poems that Freneau poured forth"
1678,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",during this incendiary period. It is significant that he included none
1679,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",of these verses in his edition of 1809. That he was honest to the core
1680,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",in his belief cannot for a moment be doubted. His impulsive Celtic
1681,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",temperament threw his whole soul into his work.
1682,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1683,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","""Ah! while I write, dear France allied,"
1684,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","My ardent wish I scarce restrain,"
1685,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",To throw these sybil leaves aside

1687,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1688,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",The frenzy among the American Republicans culminated with the arrival of
1689,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Citizen Genet, in 1793. At the Republican dinner given Genet, May 18th,"
1690,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",Citizen Freneau was elected by acclamation to translate Pichon's ode. On
1691,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","June 1st, at the civic feast, Freneau's ode, ""God Save the Rights of"
1692,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Man,"" was received with thunderous applause."
1693,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1694,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",One must study carefully this incendiary period of Freneau's life before
1695,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",he can understand fully the much discussed episode of the _National
1696,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",Gazette_. The wine of French Republicanism was sadly intoxicating. It
1697,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",could make Freneau write such a stanza as this:
1698,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1699,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","""_Virtue, Order and Religion_,"
1700,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Haste, and seek some other region;"

1702,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Destroy the mitre, rend the gown,"
1703,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","And that vile b-tc-h--Philosophy--restore,"
1704,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Did ever paper plan so much before?"""
1705,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1706,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","And then explain it by saying that ""_The National Gazette_ is the"
1707,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","vehicle of party spleen and opposition to the great principles of order,"
1708,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","virtue and religion."""
1709,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1710,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","In view of all this, it is not strange that he should have been"
1711,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","impatient with the conservative party, who not only did not grow"
1712,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","enthusiastic over the French Revolution, but even looked upon it with"
1713,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","actual disapprobation. From the very first, the editor of the _Gazette_"
1714,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","criticised the leading Federalists, especially Adams and Hamilton, and"
1715,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","he even mildly rebuked Washington, the hero of his earlier muse. The"
1716,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","administration, in his mind, was leaning toward monarchial ideas."
1717,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Washington, in his opinion, had exceeded his power in the matter of the"
1718,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","banks, and the precedent was a dangerous one. The ceremonials with which"
1719,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",the President had hedged himself about were greatly at variance with
1720,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","simple democratic ideas; and, to crown all, the ingratitude of the"
1721,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",administration (to the extremists it could have no other name) in its
1722,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",attitude toward Genet and the French people hurt him deeply. I believe
1723,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",that Freneau was fundamentally honest in his position. It is almost
1724,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","impossible to believe that a note like this, in the _Jersey Chronicle_"
1725,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","of 1795, is not sincere:"
1726,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1727,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","""The conduct of the Federal Executive of this country toward the"
1728,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Republic of France, so far as it may appear inimical, has given"
1729,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",great and general disgust to the citizens of the United States....
1730,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",It would be well if some that might be mentioned would recollect
1731,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",the nation that supported us in the late war when our infant

1735,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","In regard to Adams, who had danced at the King's ball in a scarlet suit,"
1736,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","and Hamilton, the father of the Federalists, Freneau had no scruples."
1737,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",The attacks of the _Gazette_ became more and more pointed with every
1738,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","issue, though much of the more incendiary matter was not from Freneau's"
1739,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","pen. The ""Probationary Odes,"" for instance, attributed to him by"
1740,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","contemporary enemies, and in later years quoted by Buckingham and"
1741,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Duyckinck as from his pen, were written by St. George Tucker. They were"
1742,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",published in book form by Tucker in 1796. In the sensitive state of
1743,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","party politics at this time, such frank criticism could not fail to"
1744,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",raise a tempest of rebuttal and of counter abuse. It was soon noted that
1745,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","the _Gazette_, in its attacks upon the administration, spared the State"
1746,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",department. Jefferson was never mentioned except for praise. The
1747,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","inference was obvious: either he had ""muzzled"" the paper by granting it"
1748,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","certain favors, or he was making use of it as a weapon against the very"
1749,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",administration of which he was a member.
1750,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.",
1751,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","Hamilton naturally inclined toward the latter view, and much bitterness"
1752,"""DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.","was the result. On July 25, 1792, he inserted this anonymous bit in"

1838,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",yourself and them of a juster view of the affairs of Europe than
1839,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",could be obtained from any other public source. This I had
1840,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","ineffectually attempted through the press of Mr. Fenno, while in"

1844,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","essayed it for me in Philadelphia, but his being a daily paper, did"
1845,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","not circulate sufficiently in the other States. He even tried, at"

1869,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","of a good Whig, that he would give free place to pieces written"
1870,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",against the aristocratical and monarchial principles these papers
1871,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","had inculcated. This having been in my mind, it is likely enough I"
1872,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","may have expressed it in conversation with others, though I do not"
1873,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","recollect that I did. To Freneau I think I could not, because I had"
1874,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","still seen him but once, and that at a public table, at breakfast,"
1875,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","at Mrs. Elsworth's, as I passed through New York the last year. And"
1876,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",I can safely declare that my expectations looked only to the
1877,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","chastisement of the aristocratical and monarchial writers, and not"

1879,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Hamilton can see no motive for any appointment, but that of making"

1883,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","to which they are fitted; and that Freneau, as a man of genius,"
1884,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","might find a preference in my eye to be a translating clerk, and"

1887,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","some before it appeared, and as I have with pleasure done for the"

1889,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","distinguishing excellences of elective over hereditary successions,"
1890,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",that the talents which nature has provided in sufficient
1891,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","proportion, should be selected by the society for the government of"
1892,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","their affairs, rather than this should be transmitted through the"
1893,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","loins of knaves and fools, passing from the debauches of the table"
1894,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","to those of the bed. Colonel Hamilton, alias 'Plain Facts,' says,"
1895,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",that Freneau's salary began before he resided in Philadelphia. I do
1896,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",not know what quibble he may have in reserve on the word
1897,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",'residence.' He may mean to include under that idea the removal of
1898,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","his family; for I believe he removed himself before his family did,"
1899,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",to Philadelphia. But no act of mine gave commencement to his salary
1900,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","before he so far took up his abode in Philadelphia, as to be"
1901,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",sufficiently in readiness for the duties of the office. As to the
1902,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","merits or demerits of his paper, they certainly concern me not. He"
1903,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",and Fenno are rivals for the public favor. The one courts them by
1904,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","flattery, the other by censure, and I believe it will be admitted"

2156,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Freneau's essays contributed to the _Chronicle_ are among the most

2159,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Monarchy,"" and discussed at length the leading arguments for and against"
2160,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Jay's Treaty with England. On May 23d he began to publish a series of
2161,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","papers entitled ""Tomo Cheeki, the Creek Indian in Philadelphia,"" in"
2162,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",which the manners and absurdities of the Americans are described from
2163,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",the standpoint of an observant savage. In nearly every issue of the
2164,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",paper there was an elaborate essay on some political subject. Of poetry
2165,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",there was very little. The _National Gazette_ had contained little
2166,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","poetry from the editor's pen, save earlier verses reprinted, and a few"
2167,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",political satires and republican lyrics. The influence of Peter Pindar
2168,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",was becoming more and more manifest in the poet's style. Politics and
2169,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",party strife had for a time displaced the muse. This is nowhere more
2170,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",evident than in the collected edition of his poems printed on his own
2171,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","press and issued in June, 1795."
2172,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2173,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",In many respects this is the most interesting of Freneau's collections:
2174,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",it brings us into the very presence of the poet. The earlier editions
2175,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","had been published without his supervision, the material for this one"
2176,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",passed all of it under the author's critical eye. Scarcely a poem
2177,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",escaped revision. After noting the scrupulous care with which he changed
2178,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","adjectives, improved rhymes, added new stanzas, or cut out old ones,"
2179,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","repunctuated sentences, and rearranged material, one cannot join the"
2180,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",somewhat large band of hasty and superficial critics who allude
2181,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",flippantly to the poet as a hasty and careless improviser of ephemeral
2182,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","trash. As a matter of fact, Freneau was a miser with his verses. When a"
2183,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","newspaper poem suspected to be his, especially in the period previous to"
2184,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","1795, cannot be found in any of his collections, grave doubts at once"
2185,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","arise as to whether the poem is his. He was never tired of revising, and"
2186,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","cutting, and pruning. The poems so carefully edited in 1795 were again"
2187,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",carefully revised in 1809. As an instance of his concern for the fate of
2188,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","his poems let me quote a letter, written August 29, 1781, to Matthew"
2189,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Carey:
2190,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2191,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","""I see by this day's paper that my verses on General Washington's"
2192,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","arrival, etc., are to appear in your next _Museum_. If it is not"
2193,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","too late, I would request the favour of you to rectify an error"
2194,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",(which was entirely of the press) in the fifth line of the
2195,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","thirteenth stanza, as it materially affects the sense. Instead of"
2196,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","'whom' please to read 'who.'"""
2197,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2198,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",The 1795 edition is interesting from another standpoint. The resources
2199,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",of the little country office were taxed to the utmost in the production
2200,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",of the book. At best it is a crude piece of printing. There is manifest
2201,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","everywhere an effort to keep the work within bounds, to economize"
2202,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","space. Titles are abbreviated, mottoes dropped, foot notes cut out, and"
2203,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","many earlier poems reduced, or omitted entirely. The list of omissions"
2204,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","is very suggestive: scenes one and two were cut from the ""Pictures of"
2205,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Columbus,"" the long song of Ismenius was dropped from ""The Monument of"
2206,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Phaon,"" ""The Jamaica Funeral,"" and ""The House of Night"" were reduced to"
2207,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","mere fragments, ""Female Frailty"" was dropped save for the opening lyric,"
2208,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",and there were other notable changes. In every case it will be found
2209,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","that the poet threw overboard the light and imaginative element, the"
2210,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",purely poetic.
2211,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2212,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",The reason for these omissions has been often sought. Prof. C. F.
2213,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Richardson in particular has wondered at the dropping of the intensely
2214,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","original and weirdly strong poem ""The House of Night,""--in his opinion"
2215,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",the best thing Freneau ever did. It is not difficult to answer the
2216,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",question after a careful study of the evolution of Freneau's poetic
2217,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",ideals. He began to write poetry after a thorough course of reading in
2218,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",the Latin and English classics. His early work is redolent of Virgil's
2219,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","""Eclogues,"" of Horace, of Shakespeare, of Milton's minor poems, of"
2220,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Gray's ""Elegy."" If ever there was a sensitive, beauty-loving, poetic"
2221,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","soul, the young Freneau was one. In his early inexperience he even"
2222,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",dreamed of a poetic career in which he might perhaps win a place beside
2223,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","the great masters of song. His early work like the ""Ode to Fancy,"" and"
2224,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","similar pieces, and the strong and original ""House of Night"" and ""Santa"
2225,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Cruz"" show what he might have done in another environment."
2226,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2227,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",But Revolutionary America had little encouragement for an imaginative
2228,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",poet. There was something in the air that seemed to put into men the
2229,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Franklin spirit. It was the era of common-sense, of stern reality, of"
2230,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",practical affairs. Madison voiced the age when in 1774 he advised
2231,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","Bradford, the cultured and imaginative young lover of poetry and all"
2232,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","art, to turn to sterner things:"
2233,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2234,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","""I was afraid you would not easily have loosened your affections"
2235,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",from the Belles Lettres. A Delicate Taste and warm imagination
2236,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",like yours must find it hard to give up such refined & exquisite
2237,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",enjoyments for the coarse and dry study of the Law. It is like
2238,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",leaving a pleasant flourishing field for a barren desert; perhaps
2239,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",I should not say barren either because the Law does bear fruit but
2240,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",it is sour fruit that must be gathered and pressed and distilled
2241,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",before it can bring pleasure or profit.... I myself use to have
2242,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",too great a hankering after those amusing studies. Poetry wit and
2243,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Criticism Romances Plays &c captivated me much: but I begin to
2244,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",discover that they deserve but a moderate portion of a _mortal's_
2245,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Time and that something more substantial more durable more
2246,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",profitable befits our riper age. It would be exceeding improper
2247,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",for a labouring man to have nothing but flowers in his Garden or
2248,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",to determine to eat nothing but sweet-meats and confections.
2249,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",Equally absurd would it be for a Scholar and man of Business to

2252,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",
2253,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","The first half of Freneau's life, as we have seen, was one of"
2254,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","disillusion. It took twenty-five years to kill the spark in his breast,"
2255,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",but the process though slow was sure. After the fierce period of the
2256,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",_National Gazette_ he thought of himself only as a worker in the tide of
2257,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","practical affairs, a champion of the rights of man, a protestor against"
2258,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","tyranny and wrong, and his muse had become a mere drudge, aiding by"
2259,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",satire and song what he now conceived to be his life work. He had taken
2260,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","a deliberate though sorrowful leave of his early muse in 1787, one year"
2261,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",after the appearance of his first volume of poems:

2286,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.",One cannot read long the columns of the _Jersey Chronicle_ without

2293,"""PHILIP FRENEAU.","The poem ""To the Americans of the United States,"" written in 1797, gives"

2484,VI.,The quiet period after the anxiety and stress of editorship in a great
2485,VI.,city was for a time grateful to the poet. He managed the farm in a
2486,VI.,"desultory way, but his main occupation was composing verses under his"
2487,VI.,favorite locust tree which had been planted by his father and which had
2488,VI.,"increased in size and numbers until in the words of his daughter, ""it"
2489,VI.,was a complete grove of locust trees surrounding a house grown old with
2490,VI.,"its time worn owner, his venerable mother and maiden sister beloved and"
2491,VI.,"respected for her many virtues. Her decease, which took place a few"
2492,VI.,"years previous to his own, he says in an obituary, he can say no more"
2493,VI.,"nor less than that 'she was as good and innocent as an angel.'"" This"
2494,VI.,"sister, Mary Freneau, a beautiful woman, had been wooed at one time by"
2495,VI.,"Madison, but for some reason she had refused him."

2499,VI.,"Margaret Alaire, born June 10, 1801. Eleanor married a Mr. Hammill, and"
2500,VI.,the four daughters of this union died unmarried; Agnes married Dr.
2501,VI.,"Edward Leadbeater, and the eldest son of this union, at the earnest"
2502,VI.,"request of the poet, was christened Philip Leadbeater Freneau, his"
2503,VI.,"grandfather putting into his infant hands the ancestral Bible, which was"
2504,VI.,the family treasure. The descendants of Agnes Freneau and Dr. Leadbeater
2505,VI.,are very numerous. The two younger daughters of the poet never married.

2507,VI.,"The active pen of Freneau, so long practiced in discussing the affairs"
2508,VI.,"of the day, could not rest idle during his period of retirement. He"
2509,VI.,"began a series of letters to the Philadelphia _Aurora_ and other papers,"
2510,VI.,"and on December 30, 1799, issued them in a volume entitled ""Letters on"

2515,VI.,"breezy, colloquial style, and the simple-minded old cobbler is well"
2516,VI.,characterized. Freneau has actually succeeded in making him a living
2517,VI.,"creature, and his opinions and ""whim whams"" are full of hard sense and"
2518,VI.,practical wisdom. The book is by all means the best prose that Freneau
2519,VI.,ever wrote. So easy is the style and so natural is the characterization
2520,VI.,that I cannot forbear quoting at some length from a chapter chosen
2521,VI.,almost at random:

2526,"MR. EDITOR,","MR. EDITOR,"
2527,"MR. EDITOR,",
2528,"MR. EDITOR,",Having heard that there was a tavern at about the distance of a
2529,"MR. EDITOR,","mile or so from my favourite country spot, where now and then a few"
2530,"MR. EDITOR,","neighbours meet to spit, smoke segars, drink apple whiskey, cider"
2531,"MR. EDITOR,","or cider-royal, and read the news--a few evenings ago, I put on my"
2532,"MR. EDITOR,","best coat, combed out my wig, put my spectacles in my pocket, and a"
2533,"MR. EDITOR,",quarter dollar--This I thought was right; for although Mrs. Slender
2534,"MR. EDITOR,","told me eleven-pence was enough, says I, I'll e'en take the quarter"
2535,"MR. EDITOR,","dollar, for a man always feels himself of more consequence when he"
2536,"MR. EDITOR,",has got good money in his pocket--so out I walks with a good stout
2537,"MR. EDITOR,","stick in my hand, which I always make a point to carry with me,"
2538,"MR. EDITOR,",lest the dogs should make rather freer with my legs than I could
2539,"MR. EDITOR,","wish. But I had not gone more than half the way, when, by making a"
2540,"MR. EDITOR,","false step, I splash'd my stocking from knee to the ancle. Odds my"
2541,"MR. EDITOR,","heart, said I, see what a hand I have made of my stocking; I'll be"
2542,"MR. EDITOR,","bail, added I, I'll hear of this in both sides of my head--but it"
2543,"MR. EDITOR,","can't now be helped--this, and a thousand worse accidents, which"
2544,"MR. EDITOR,","daily happen, are all occasioned by public neglect, and the"
2545,"MR. EDITOR,","misapplication of the public's money--Had I, said I, (talking to"
2546,"MR. EDITOR,",myself all the while) the disposal of but half the income of the
2547,"MR. EDITOR,","United States, I could at least so order matters, that a man might"
2548,"MR. EDITOR,",walk to his next neighbour's without splashing his stockings or
2549,"MR. EDITOR,","being in danger of breaking his legs in ruts, holes, gutts, and"
2550,"MR. EDITOR,","gullies. I do not know, says I to myself, as I moralized on my"
2551,"MR. EDITOR,","splash'd stocking, but money might with more profit be laid out in"
2552,"MR. EDITOR,","repairing the roads, than in marine establishments, supporting a"
2553,"MR. EDITOR,","standing army, useless embassies, exorbitant salaries, given to"
2554,"MR. EDITOR,","many flashy fellows that are no honour to us, or to themselves, and"
2555,"MR. EDITOR,",chartering whole ships to carry a single man to another
2556,"MR. EDITOR,","nation--Odds my life, continued I, what a number of difficulties a"
2557,"MR. EDITOR,","man labours under, who has never read further than Lilly's"
2558,"MR. EDITOR,","grammar, and has but a poor brain--had I been favoured with a good"
2559,"MR. EDITOR,","education, I could no doubt readily see the _great usefulness_ of"
2560,"MR. EDITOR,","all these measures of government, that now appear to me so"
2561,"MR. EDITOR,","unaccountable--I could then, said I, still talking to myself, see"
2562,"MR. EDITOR,","the reason why the old patriots, whose blood flowed so freely in"
2563,"MR. EDITOR,","purchasing our independence, are cast aside, like a broken pitcher,"
2564,"MR. EDITOR,",(as the scripture says) and why the old tories and active refugees
2565,"MR. EDITOR,","are advanced to places of power, honour and trust--I could then be"
2566,"MR. EDITOR,","able to explain why Robbins, an American citizen, for killing an"
2567,"MR. EDITOR,","Englishman who held him a slave, and so gaining his liberty, was"
2568,"MR. EDITOR,","delivered to the English to be hanged--and Sterret, who killed a"
2569,"MR. EDITOR,","veteran sailor, who had formerly fought and bled in the cause of"
2570,"MR. EDITOR,","his country, and then was bravely doing his duty, yet, remains"
2571,"MR. EDITOR,","unpunished.... As I said this, by accident I looked up, and"
2572,"MR. EDITOR,","perceived to my surprise, that if I had gone but one step further,"
2573,"MR. EDITOR,",I would have actually knocked my nose against the sign-post--I
2574,"MR. EDITOR,","declare, said I, here I am, this is a tavern indeed. I then felt in"
2575,"MR. EDITOR,","my pocket, if I had my quarter dollar, which to my joy I found--I"
2576,"MR. EDITOR,","then unbuttoned my coat, to shew my silk waistcoat, pulled my watch"
2577,"MR. EDITOR,","chain a good piece longer out of my pocket, fixed my hat a little"
2578,"MR. EDITOR,",better on my head--and then advanced boldly into the tavern--But I
2579,"MR. EDITOR,","see I am got to the end of my page, and therefore must defer the"
2580,"MR. EDITOR,","remainder of my adventure to another opportunity."""
2581,"MR. EDITOR,",
2582,"MR. EDITOR,","In the advertisement of the book, the author made the half promise of"

2589,"MR. EDITOR,","the public attention."""
2590,"MR. EDITOR,",
2591,"MR. EDITOR,",The volume was never published. The little family at Mount Pleasant
2592,"MR. EDITOR,","could not subsist alone on letters and poems, however brilliant. The"
2593,"MR. EDITOR,","outlook was not a bright one, as the following letter[17] to his brother"
2594,"MR. EDITOR,","Peter, in Charleston, dated March 1, 1801, would indicate:"
2595,"MR. EDITOR,",
2596,"MR. EDITOR,","""Having been here [New York] a day or two and finding the brig"

2599,"MR. EDITOR,",
2600,"MR. EDITOR,","""I left all well at home last Thursday, and the place, etc., as"
2601,"MR. EDITOR,",well as could be expected after my poor mother's absence. I have
2602,"MR. EDITOR,",been and shall be for some time busy in repairing old fences and
2603,"MR. EDITOR,","making new ones, and some other small improvements, as far as I"
2604,"MR. EDITOR,",personally can with the money you let me have. Helen goes to school
2605,"MR. EDITOR,","here, the other two girls are at home, but Agnes is to come here"
2606,"MR. EDITOR,",next month for the same purpose for awhile. There are more cares
2607,"MR. EDITOR,","and vexations coming on, but still they must be got through with at"
2608,"MR. EDITOR,",some rate. Probably I shall have to embark on some new expedition
2609,"MR. EDITOR,","or plan before long wherever or to whatever the devil, etc., shall"
2610,"MR. EDITOR,",see fit to drive me. But I shall attempt nothing if I can before I
2611,"MR. EDITOR,","see you here, in April or May, as you promised."
2612,"MR. EDITOR,",
2613,"MR. EDITOR,","""I return this morning to Jersey. Mr. Hunn, Peggy, Mamma and Polly"
2614,"MR. EDITOR,",all desire their love to you. My love and respects to Mrs. Freneau
2615,"MR. EDITOR,","and Miss Dora with her mother and family. Remembrances, love, etc.,"
2616,"MR. EDITOR,","to Mr. Davis, and may I expect to have a line from you by Capt."
2617,"MR. EDITOR,","Peter."""
2618,"MR. EDITOR,",
2619,"MR. EDITOR,",Freneau was at best a half-hearted farmer. A little anecdote told by the
2620,"MR. EDITOR,","family is eloquent. One day the poet and his wife, who had walked"
2621,"MR. EDITOR,","together into the field to inspect the work, found a slave asleep in the"
2622,"MR. EDITOR,",young corn. Mrs. Freneau seizing his hoe declared that she would show
2623,"MR. EDITOR,","him how to work. At the very first attempt, however, she cut down a hill"
2624,"MR. EDITOR,","of corn, whereupon the slave remarked gleefully: ""Ho, ho, Missie"
2625,"MR. EDITOR,","Freneau, if that's the way you hoe, the corn'll never grow."" She threw"
2626,"MR. EDITOR,","down the hoe in disgust, declaring that ""No wonder the farm doesn't pay"
2627,"MR. EDITOR,","when even the slaves talk in rhymes."""
2628,"MR. EDITOR,",
2629,"MR. EDITOR,",The affairs of the poet were soon such as to give real concern to his
2630,"MR. EDITOR,","friends. In a letter dated September 13, 1801, a part of which we have"
2631,"MR. EDITOR,","already quoted, Aedanus Burke wrote Madison:"
2632,"MR. EDITOR,",
2633,"MR. EDITOR,","""I am sorry to have it to say that Freneau, with his wife and two"
2634,"MR. EDITOR,","children, is still in embarrassed circumstances. He is a virtuous,"
2635,"MR. EDITOR,","honest man, and an undeviating Republican; yet utterly incapable"
2636,"MR. EDITOR,",of soliciting anything for himself. The best apology I can offer
2637,"MR. EDITOR,","for mentioning it, is that I know you have great regard for him."
2638,"MR. EDITOR,","You were at College together, as I heard you often say."""
2639,"MR. EDITOR,",
2640,"MR. EDITOR,","However this letter may have been received, Freneau obtained no"
2641,"MR. EDITOR,","appointment either from Madison or Jefferson, though there is a"
2642,"MR. EDITOR,",persistent tradition among his descendants that he was offered a good
2643,"MR. EDITOR,",position under President Jefferson but refused it on the ground that the
2644,"MR. EDITOR,","latter had deserted him in the _National Gazette_ affair. On October 23,"
2645,"MR. EDITOR,","1803, his old-time friend, Francis Bailey, addressed Madison:"
2646,"MR. EDITOR,",
2647,"MR. EDITOR,","""My dear sir: The death of Col. Bauman of New York has left the"
2648,"MR. EDITOR,",Post Office without a Master. I know of no man in the United States

2650,"MR. EDITOR,","than Philip Freneau."""
2651,"MR. EDITOR,",
2652,"MR. EDITOR,","As far as we know, there was no response, though the family declare that"
2653,"MR. EDITOR,","Madison sent for him and that the poet proudly said, ""James Madison"
2654,"MR. EDITOR,","knows where I live, let him come to see me."""
2655,"MR. EDITOR,",
2656,"MR. EDITOR,","The ""expedition"" to mend his fortunes, which he had mentioned to his"
2657,"MR. EDITOR,","brother as a disagreeable possibility, became at length inevitable. On"
2658,"MR. EDITOR,","Saturday, November 27th, he embarked at New York as Master of the"
2659,"MR. EDITOR,","schooner _John_, bound for Fredericksburg, Virginia, with a cargo of"
2660,"MR. EDITOR,",salt. A minute log book of this voyage is still to be seen.[18] After an
2661,"MR. EDITOR,","exceedingly hard experience he returned to New York, January 12, 1803,"
2662,"MR. EDITOR,","and the last entry in the log reads ""Finished discharging the"
2663,"MR. EDITOR,",wheat--1264 bushels at 17 cents a bushel freight--214 dollars and 88
2664,"MR. EDITOR,","cents."""
2665,"MR. EDITOR,",
2666,"MR. EDITOR,",This was the opening voyage of his last period at sea. His brother Peter
2667,"MR. EDITOR,","had fitted out at Charleston a new brig for the Madeira trade, and until"
2668,"MR. EDITOR,",1807 Freneau was busy plying between Charleston and the Azores. In one
2669,"MR. EDITOR,",of his books of navigation is inscribed the following:
2670,"MR. EDITOR,",
2671,"MR. EDITOR,","""Sailed from Charleston for Maderia with brig Washington, May 12,"
2672,"MR. EDITOR,",1803. Got there June 23. Arrived back at Charleston Aug. 16.

2674,"MR. EDITOR,","""Sailed in ditto from Charleston Jan. 25, 1804. Arrived in Maderia"
2675,"MR. EDITOR,","March 7th following. A hurricane of wind the whole way. April 12,"
2676,"MR. EDITOR,",sailed from Funchal Road for Teneriff. Arrived at Santa Cruz the
2677,"MR. EDITOR,","15th; at Arasava, 22nd. Sailed May 11th. Arrived in Charleston,"
2678,"MR. EDITOR,","June 10."""
2679,"MR. EDITOR,",
2680,"MR. EDITOR,","On June 30, 1806, he was in Savannah, Georgia, as Master of the sloop"
2681,"MR. EDITOR,",_Industry_. He made his last voyage to the Azores in the _Washington_ in
2682,"MR. EDITOR,",1807. During this last period of sea life we find evidences everywhere
2683,"MR. EDITOR,",that this old enthusiasm for nautical adventure had greatly waned. He
2684,"MR. EDITOR,",was a sailor now from sheer necessity; he was approaching old age and he
2685,"MR. EDITOR,",longed for the quiet of his home and his family. In one of his books of
2686,"MR. EDITOR,",navigation of this period is penned a verse made in mid Atlantic:
2687,"MR. EDITOR,",
2688,"MR. EDITOR,","""In dreams condemned to roam"
2689,"MR. EDITOR,",He left his native home
2690,"MR. EDITOR,",O'er land and ocean vast and wide

2694,"MR. EDITOR,","In 1809, Freneau now in retirement at Mount Pleasant, began a new"

2720,"MR. EDITOR,","at all events, and in contradiction to my wishes, as I had left"
2721,"MR. EDITOR,","these old scribblings, to float quietly down the stream of oblivion"
2722,"MR. EDITOR,","to their destined element the ocean of forgetfulness. However, I"
2723,"MR. EDITOR,","have concluded to remain here this Summer, and have them published"

2734,"MR. EDITOR,","prose, but suspect that anything I have written in that way is so"
2735,"MR. EDITOR,","inferior to the Poetry, that the contrast will be injurious to the"

2737,"MR. EDITOR,","here about two years, to amuse myself, as well as the Public, with"
2738,"MR. EDITOR,","such matter as that of the fat man you refer to, and if the public"
2739,"MR. EDITOR,",are in the same humour they shall be gratified.--But I am intruding
2740,"MR. EDITOR,",on your time and will add no more at present.--I had almost said--

2908,"MR. EDITOR,","animals, and when the season came for slaughtering the porkers, he"
2909,"MR. EDITOR,","generally managed it so as to have some business in New York, and he was"
2910,"MR. EDITOR,",usually absent when poultry was wanted for dinner. Mrs. Freneau had to

2913,"MR. EDITOR,",
2914,"MR. EDITOR,",His interest in politics was still keen. He watched carefully all the

3167,"MR. EDITOR,",of his occasional poems was quite romantic. As he had at command
3168,"MR. EDITOR,","types and a printing press, when an incident of moment in the"
3169,"MR. EDITOR,","Revolution occurred, he would retire for composition, or find"
3170,"MR. EDITOR,","shelter under the shade of some tree, indite his lyrics, repair to"
3171,"MR. EDITOR,","the press, set up his types, and issue his productions. There was"
3172,"MR. EDITOR,",no difficulty in versification with him. I told him what I had
3173,"MR. EDITOR,","heard Jeffrey, the Scotch Reviewer, say of his writings, that the"
3174,"MR. EDITOR,","time would arrive when his poetry, like that of Hudibras, would"
3175,"MR. EDITOR,",command a commentator like Gray. On some of the occasions when
3176,"MR. EDITOR,","Freneau honored me with a visit, we had within our circle one of my"
3177,"MR. EDITOR,","earliest friends, that rare Knickerbocker, Gulian C. Verplanck. I"
3178,"MR. EDITOR,",need not add that the charm of my interview with the bard was
3179,"MR. EDITOR,",heightened by the rich funds of antiquarian lore possessed by the
3180,"MR. EDITOR,",latter.
3181,"MR. EDITOR,",
3182,"MR. EDITOR,","""It is remarkable how tenaciously Freneau preserved the"
3183,"MR. EDITOR,","acquisitions of his early classical studies, notwithstanding he had"
3184,"MR. EDITOR,","for many years, in the after portion of his life, been occupied in"
3185,"MR. EDITOR,",pursuits so entirely alien to books. There is no portrait of the
3186,"MR. EDITOR,","patriot Freneau; he always firmly declined the painter's art, and"
3187,"MR. EDITOR,","would brook no 'counterfeit presentiment.'"""
3188,"MR. EDITOR,",
3189,"MR. EDITOR,",Freneau's frequent visits to New York were the chief solace of his last
3190,"MR. EDITOR,",years. Says Dr. Francis:
3191,"MR. EDITOR,",
3192,"MR. EDITOR,","""Freneau was widely known to a large circle of our most prominent"
3193,"MR. EDITOR,","and patriotic New Yorkers. His native city, with all his"
3194,"MR. EDITOR,","wanderings, was ever uppermost in his mind and in his affections."
3195,"MR. EDITOR,","While in the employment of Jefferson, as a translator in the"
3196,"MR. EDITOR,","department of state, upon the organization of Congress, with"
3197,"MR. EDITOR,","Washington at its head, he had the gratification of witnessing the"
3198,"MR. EDITOR,","progress of improvement, and might have enjoyed increased"
3199,"MR. EDITOR,",facilities had he not enlisted with an indiscreet zeal as an
3200,"MR. EDITOR,","advocate of the radical doctrines of the day. Freneau was,"
3201,"MR. EDITOR,","nevertheless, esteemed a true patriot; and his private worth, his"
3202,"MR. EDITOR,","courteous manner, and his general bearing won admiration with all"
3203,"MR. EDITOR,",parties. His pen was more acrimonious than his heart. He was
3204,"MR. EDITOR,","tolerant, frank in expression, and not deficient in geniality. He"
3205,"MR. EDITOR,","was highly cultivated in classical knowledge, abounding in"
3206,"MR. EDITOR,","anecdotes of the revolutionary crisis, and extensively acquainted"
3207,"MR. EDITOR,",with prominent characters.
3208,"MR. EDITOR,",
3209,"MR. EDITOR,","""It were easy to record a long list of eminent citizens who ever"
3210,"MR. EDITOR,",gave him a cordial welcome. He was received with the warmest
3211,"MR. EDITOR,","greetings by the old soldier, Governor George Clinton. He, also, in"
3212,"MR. EDITOR,","the intimacy of kindred feeling, found an agreeable pastime with"
3213,"MR. EDITOR,","the learned Provoost, the first regularly consecrated Bishop of the"
3214,"MR. EDITOR,","American Protestant Episcopate, who himself had shouldered a musket"
3215,"MR. EDITOR,","in the Revolution, and hence was sometimes called the fighting"
3216,"MR. EDITOR,","bishop. They were allied by classical tastes, a love of natural"
3217,"MR. EDITOR,","science, and ardor in the cause of liberty. With Gates he compared"
3218,"MR. EDITOR,",the achievements of Monmouth with those at Saratoga. With Col. Fish
3219,"MR. EDITOR,",he reviewed the capture of Yorktown; with Dr. Mitchell he
3220,"MR. EDITOR,","rehearsed, from his own sad experience, the physical sufferings and"
3221,"MR. EDITOR,",various diseases of the incarcerated patriots of the Jersey
3222,"MR. EDITOR,",prison-ship; and descanted on Italian poetry and the piscatory
3223,"MR. EDITOR,","eclogues of Sannazarius. He, doubtless, furnished Dr. Benjamin"
3224,"MR. EDITOR,",Dewitt with data for his funeral discourse on the remains of the
3225,"MR. EDITOR,","11,500 American martyrs. With Pintard he could laud Horace and talk"
3226,"MR. EDITOR,",largely of Paul Jones. With Major Fairlie he discussed the tactics
3227,"MR. EDITOR,",and chivalry of Baron Steuben. With Sylvanus Miller he compared
3228,"MR. EDITOR,",notes on the political clubs of 1795-1810. With Dewitt Clinton and
3229,"MR. EDITOR,",Cadwallader D. Colden he debated the projects of internal
3230,"MR. EDITOR,","improvement and artificial navigation, based on the famous"
3231,"MR. EDITOR,","precedent of the Languedoc canal."""
3232,"MR. EDITOR,",
3233,"MR. EDITOR,",The death of Freneau was a sad one. On the evening of the 18th of
3234,"MR. EDITOR,","December, 1832, he had gone on an errand to Freehold, some two miles"
3235,"MR. EDITOR,","distant. When he set out to return, late in the evening, a fierce and"
3236,"MR. EDITOR,","blinding storm was in progress. His friends sought to dissuade him, but"
3237,"MR. EDITOR,",he insisted on returning. Instead of taking the long way round by the
3238,"MR. EDITOR,","road, he took the usual short way through the fields, and was soon lost"
3239,"MR. EDITOR,","in the roaring ""blizzard."" He circled into a swamp, and doubtless, after"
3240,"MR. EDITOR,","hours of wandering, sank down benumbed and hopeless, to be found by his"
3241,"MR. EDITOR,","friends a few hours later, still breathing but nearly lifeless. For the"
3242,"MR. EDITOR,","whispered tradition that he was intoxicated when he left the town, there"
3243,"MR. EDITOR,",is no foundation.
3244,"MR. EDITOR,",
3245,"MR. EDITOR,",The next issue of the _Monmouth Press_ contained a notice of his death:
3246,"MR. EDITOR,",
3247,"MR. EDITOR,","""Mr. Freneau was in the village and started, towards evening, to go"
3248,"MR. EDITOR,","home, about two miles. In attempting to go across he appears to"
3249,"MR. EDITOR,",have got lost and mired in a bog where his lifeless corpse was
3250,"MR. EDITOR,",discovered yesterday morning. Captain Freneau was a stanch Whig in
3251,"MR. EDITOR,","the time of the Revolution, a good soldier, and a warm patriot. The"
3252,"MR. EDITOR,",productions of his pen animated his countrymen in the darkest days
3253,"MR. EDITOR,",of '76 and the effusions of his muse cheered the desponding soldier
3254,"MR. EDITOR,","as he fought the battles of freedom."""
3255,"MR. EDITOR,",
3256,"MR. EDITOR,","His old friend, John Pintard, wrote a biographical notice of the poet in"
3257,"MR. EDITOR,","the _New York Mirror_ for January 12, 1833, in which he dwelt largely"
3258,"MR. EDITOR,",upon his mental endowments and accomplishments:
3259,"MR. EDITOR,",
3260,"MR. EDITOR,","""He was a man of great reading and extensive acquirements; few"
3261,"MR. EDITOR,","were more thoroughly versed in classical literature, and fewer"
3262,"MR. EDITOR,","still who knew as much about the early history of our country, the"
3263,"MR. EDITOR,","organization of the government, and the use and progress of"
3264,"MR. EDITOR,","parties."""
3265,"MR. EDITOR,",
3266,"MR. EDITOR,",The house which Freneau occupied during his last years is still
3267,"MR. EDITOR,","standing. His remains rest in the little cemetery at Mount Pleasant,"
3268,"MR. EDITOR,","which recently, in honor of the poet, has been rechristened Freneau."
3269,"MR. EDITOR,",
3270,"MR. EDITOR,",
3271,VII.,VII.
3272,VII.,
3273,VII.,"The personality of Philip Freneau, if we judge from contemporary"
3274,VII.,"testimony and the effect which his personal presence invariably exerted,"
3275,VII.,"was a singularly winning one. The bluff, hearty old sailor breathed out"
3276,VII.,"good-will and honesty with every breath. He was the soul of honor, and,"
3277,VII.,"despite his caustic pen, the kindest hearted creature in the world. All"
3278,VII.,that one of his grand-daughters can remember of him is that once he took
3279,VII.,"her upon his knee and chided her for having killed a fly. ""Surely,"" he"
3280,VII.,"said, ""it was not made without some wise end, and its little life was as"
3281,VII.,"dear to him as is yours to you."" It reminds one of ""My Uncle Toby."""
3282,VII.,There is a cheery optimism in many of his poems. A stanza like this
3283,VII.,might have been written by Browning:
3284,VII.,
3285,VII.,"""All nature must decay, 'tis true,"
3286,VII.,"But nature shall her face renew,"
3287,VII.,"Her travels in a circle make,"
3288,VII.,"Freeze but to thaw, sleep but to wake,"
3289,VII.,"Die but to live and live to die."""
3290,VII.,
3291,VII.,His temperament was Celtic. He inherited with his French blood a
3292,VII.,"passionate love for beauty, a sensuous, dreamy delight in the merely"
3293,VII.,"poetic, in the weird and romantic. He had not the Teutonic stability; he"
3294,VII.,"was easily exalted, easily depressed; he went often to extremes; he was"
3295,VII.,"sensitive to a degree that made criticism a torture, and he was proud"
3296,VII.,beyond all reason. He had been deeply touched by the principles of the
3297,VII.,Revolution; he had suffered personally at the hands of the enemy; he
3298,VII.,"had followed Paine in his democratic doctrines even to the extremes, and"
3299,VII.,he tried to live consistently with these exalted ideals. His honesty and
3300,VII.,his ignorance of the world prevented him from seeing how greatly these
3301,VII.,principles must be modified to become of really practical value.
3302,VII.,
3303,VII.,His kindly heart made him a fierce foe to all kinds of tyranny and
3304,VII.,oppression. He saw sights in the West Indies that made him a bitter
3305,VII.,opponent of human slavery. Again and again in his poems and prose
3306,VII.,sketches does he condemn the evil. His message is almost as intense as
3307,VII.,Whittier's:
3308,VII.,
3309,VII.,"""O come the time and haste the day"
3310,VII.,"When man shall man no longer crush,"
3311,VII.,"When reason shall enforce her sway,"
3312,VII.,Nor these fair regions raise the blush
3313,VII.,Where still the African complains
3314,VII.,"And mourns his yet unbroken chains."""
3315,VII.,
3316,VII.,"Not only slavery, but every other form of oppression and wrong received"
3317,VII.,his condemnation. He wrote boldly against intemperance in a day when the
3318,VII.,use of intoxicating liquors was well-nigh universal and wholly
3319,VII.,uncriticised; he spoke eloquently on cruelty to animals; and he was one
3320,VII.,of the earliest to demand equal rights for man and woman.
3321,VII.,
3322,VII.,Freneau's religious inclinations have been sometimes harshly criticised
3323,VII.,by those of puritanic creed. The school of Dr. Dwight could speak of him
3324,VII.,"only in contempt, yet it is true that the poet was a deeply religious"
3325,VII.,man. His love of freedom and his perfect sincerity affected his creed.
3326,VII.,"He had an intense dislike for hollow formalism. In his ""Jamaica Funeral"""
3327,VII.,he has pictured a hypocritical priest in colors as vivid almost as
3328,VII.,Chaucer's. He detested
3329,VII.,
3330,VII.,"""The holy man by Bishops holy made."""
3331,VII.,
3332,VII.,"He loved sincerity, and the creed that came not from dry formalism, but"
3333,VII.,from reason and from an honest heart.
3334,VII.,
3335,VII.,It has often been overlooked by his critics that Freneau was a widely
3336,VII.,read and thoroughly cultured man; that he was a linguist of more than
3337,VII.,ordinary powers; and that he knew intimately the chief writings in
3338,VII.,"Latin, Italian, French, and English. He was no ignorant, careless"
3339,VII.,"scribbler, tossing into the ephemeral columns of the press hasty rhymes"
3340,VII.,of which he never thought again. He revised and corrected with patient
3341,VII.,"care, and he took a deep interest in the children of his pen, rescuing"
3342,VII.,at one time or another almost every one of them from the oblivion of the
3343,VII.,newspaper.
3344,VII.,
3345,VII.,
3346,VIII.,VIII.
3347,VIII.,
3348,VIII.,"As to the absolute literary value of Freneau's literary remains, there"
3349,VIII.,"is room for honest difference of opinion. He is certainly not, if we"
3350,VIII.,"judge him from what he actually produced, a great poet. But he must in"
3351,VIII.,fairness be viewed against the background of his age and his
3352,VIII.,environment. Nature had equipped him as she has equipped few other men.
3353,VIII.,He had the poet's creative imagination; he had an exquisite sense of the
3354,VIII.,beautiful; and he had a realization of his own poetic endowments that
3355,VIII.,kept him during a long life constantly true to the muse. Scarcely a
3356,VIII.,"month went by in all his life, from his early boyhood, that was not"
3357,VIII.,"marked by poetic composition. Few poets, even in later and more"
3358,VIII.,"auspicious days, have devoted their lives more assiduously to song."
3359,VIII.,
3360,VIII.,Freneau was the first to catch what may be called the new poetic impulse
3361,VIII.,"in America--the new epic note. Previous to the Revolutionary era,"
3362,VIII.,America was destitute even of the germs of an original literature.
3363,VIII.,"Before she could produce anything really strong and individual, there"
3364,VIII.,was necessary some great primal impulse that should stir mightily the
3365,VIII.,whole people; that should strike from their hands the old books and the
3366,VIII.,old models; that should arouse them to a true realization of themselves;
3367,VIII.,and that should clear the atmosphere for a new and broader view of human
3368,VIII.,"life. Such new forces are always needed by society, but they stalk with"
3369,VIII.,long strides over the centuries.
3370,VIII.,
3371,VIII.,In pre-Revolutionary America such an upheaval was near at hand. It came
3372,VIII.,with appalling suddenness. The colonists had had no gradual preparation
3373,VIII.,"for the idea of separation from England. As late as 1775, Franklin"
3374,VIII.,declared before the House of Commons that in all of his journeyings up
3375,VIII.,and down the colonies he had not heard expressed one single wish for
3376,VIII.,"complete independence. Even after Concord and Bunker Hill, Freneau, the"
3377,VIII.,"radical, could write:"
3378,VIII.,
3379,VIII.,"""Long may Britannia rule our hearts again,"
3380,VIII.,"Rule as she ruled in George the Second's reign."""
3381,VIII.,
3382,VIII.,"The idea of independence came all in a moment; but once it had come, it"
3383,VIII.,went with leaps and bounds to its extreme. Never in all history has a
3384,VIII.,whole people been lifted by such rapid stages into a region of such vast
3385,VIII.,"outlook. We can trace the growth of the new spirit, not decade by"
3386,VIII.,"decade, but month by month: Justice, Freedom, Independence, and then the"
3387,VIII.,"radiant vision of perfect Liberty and the Rights of Man, and then like a"
3388,VIII.,torrent the sense of boundless possibilities and glorious destiny:
3389,VIII.,
3390,VIII.,"""No pent-up Utica contracts our powers,"
3391,VIII.,"But the whole boundless continent is ours."""
3392,VIII.,
3393,VIII.,"The soul of man stirred by such ideals, and successful in realizing them"
3394,VIII.,"beyond all dreams, struggled for utterance. It is such upheavals in"
3395,VIII.,human society that make poets and bring outbursts of song and periods in
3396,VIII.,the history of literature. But there was no burst of song in America;
3397,VIII.,instead there followed one of the most pathetic spectacles in all
3398,VIII.,literary history--a people with a vision that transported them into the
3399,VIII.,"clouds, yet powerless through environment and early education to"
3400,VIII.,"transmute that vision into song. The South, thrilled by the new spirit,"
3401,VIII.,"turned it at once into action, and took the leadership in war and"
3402,VIII.,"statesmanship. New England lifted up her voice, but she could speak only"
3403,VIII.,through the medium of old spiritual conceptions and worn-out poetic
3404,VIII.,"forms. A young Connecticut parson, thrilled through and through, pours"
3405,VIII.,his enthusiasm into an epic of the wars of Joshua done in the heroics of
3406,VIII.,"Pope; a brilliant Boston lad would sing of ""War and Washington,"" but he"
3407,VIII.,"must set it to the tune of Dryden; and a gifted Connecticut satirist,"
3408,VIII.,"overflowing with the true poetic spirit, is content simply to add new"
3409,VIII.,"American stanzas to ""Hudibras."" With all her rhymers and all her"
3410,VIII.,"inspiration, New England gave forth not a single original note. It was"
3411,VIII.,the repeating of the old spectacle of a heavenly anthem sung unto
3412,VIII.,"shepherds,--unto those utterly unable to give it utterance."
3413,VIII.,
3414,VIII.,"We see them, however, struggling heroically with the burden. From 1774,"
3415,VIII.,"when Dwight completed his ""Conquest of Canaan,"" ""the first piece of this"
3416,VIII.,"kind ever attempted in this country,"" as he observed in his preface,"
3417,VIII.,"until 1808, which ends the period with Barlow's ""Columbiad""--the"
3418,VIII.,"""Polyolbion"" of American poetry--the years are strewn thick with the"
3419,VIII.,wrecks of epics. Every poet of the era felt his soul burn with the epic
3420,VIII.,"fire. Charles Brockden Brown, when only sixteen, had started no less"
3421,VIII.,"than three of these Homeric efforts: one on the discovery of America,"
3422,VIII.,"and one each on the conquests of Mexico and Peru. It was our heroic era,"
3423,VIII.,but it yielded almost nothing of value. Mere exaltation availeth little
3424,VIII.,unless it be grounded either upon genius or long-continued culture.
3425,VIII.,
3426,VIII.,"America, however, was not without her genius. Before Dwight and Barlow"
3427,VIII.,"and Trumbull had written a line, Freneau at Princeton was planning epics"
3428,VIII.,"American in scene and spirit. He had dreamed, over his Virgil, of a"
3429,VIII.,greater Aeneas who had sailed into the pathless West to discover a new
3430,VIII.,"world, and to plant there the seeds of a greater than Rome; he had"
3431,VIII.,translated with beating heart the words of Seneca:
3432,VIII.,
3433,VIII.,"""The time shall come, when numerous years are past,"
3434,VIII.,"When ocean shall unloose the bands of things,"
3435,VIII.,And an extended region rise at last;
3436,VIII.,
3437,VIII.,"""And Typhis shall disclose the mighty land"
3438,VIII.,"Far, far away, where none have rov'd before;"
3439,VIII.,Nor shall the world's remotest region be
3440,VIII.,"Gibraltar's rock, or Thule's savage shore."""
3441,VIII.,
3442,VIII.,"""Fired at the theme,"" he had mapped out the epic of a new world; but his"
3443,VIII.,"work of this era, like all schoolboy epics, had resulted only in"
3444,VIII.,fragments which were to strew his earlier volumes. How strong and
3445,VIII.,original was this youthful dream one can judge from the ringing lines of
3446,VIII.,"""Columbus to Ferdinand,"" ""Discovery,"" and the ""Pictures of Columbus,"""
3447,VIII.,which are mere epic fragments. There is an originality and a fire in
3448,VIII.,them utterly new in American poetry. There is poetry of a high order in
3449,VIII.,"such a climax as that recording the soliloquy of the dying Columbus,"
3450,VIII.,beginning:
3451,VIII.,
3452,VIII.,"""The winds blow high; one other world remains,"
3453,VIII.,"Once more without a guide I find the way."""
3454,VIII.,
3455,VIII.,"But Commencement was at hand. Here was a chance, indeed; here was a"
3456,VIII.,theme commensurate with the occasion. The two young dreamers would
3457,VIII.,"outline an epic poem; they would essay ""Things unattempted yet in prose"
3458,VIII.,"or rhyme"":"
3459,VIII.,
3460,VIII.,"""Now shall the adventurous Muse attempt a theme"
3461,VIII.,"More new, more noble, and more flush of fame"
3462,VIII.,"Than all that went before."""
3463,VIII.,
3464,VIII.,Never was graduating exercise based on broader foundations. The young
3465,VIII.,graduates bewail at every step their limitations of space. The plan they
3466,VIII.,"suggest is the plan of a ""Columbiad."" They would begin with all the tale"
3467,VIII.,of Columbus; they would rehearse the story of Cortez and Pizarro; they
3468,VIII.,would discuss at learned length the origin and the characteristics of
3469,VIII.,the Indians; they would tell the story of the early colonies; and would
3470,VIII.,trace the course of settlement and review the progress and the promise
3471,VIII.,of agriculture and commerce; they would peer into the future and mark
3472,VIII.,the time
3473,VIII.,
3474,VIII.,"""When we shall spread"
3475,VIII.,"Dominion from the North and South and West,"
3476,VIII.,"Far from the Atlantic to Pacific shores,"
3477,VIII.,"And shackle half the convex of the main."""
3478,VIII.,
3479,VIII.,"But, alas, the time! An epic cannot be condensed into a graduation"
3480,VIII.,exercise. Suddenly the poet bursts into true prophetic rapture:
3481,VIII.,
3482,VIII.,"""I see, I see"
3483,VIII.,"A thousand kingdoms rais'd, cities, and men"
3484,VIII.,Num'rous as sand upon the ocean shore;
3485,VIII.,Th' Ohio then shall glide by many a town
3486,VIII.,"Of note: and where the Mississippi stream,"
3487,VIII.,"By forests shaded now runs weeping on,"
3488,VIII.,Nations shall grow and States not less in fame
3489,VIII.,Than Greece and Rome of old: we too shall boast
3490,VIII.,"Our Alexanders, Pompeys, heroes, kings"
3491,VIII.,That in the womb of time yet dormant lye
3492,VIII.,Waiting the joyful hour of life and light.
3493,VIII.,"O snatch us hence, ye muses! to those days"
3494,VIII.,"When, through the veil of dark antiquity,"
3495,VIII.,"Our sons shall hear of us as things remote,"
3496,VIII.,"That blossom'd in the morn of days, alas!"
3497,VIII.,"How could I weep that we were born so soon,"
3498,VIII.,In the beginning of more happy times!
3499,VIII.,
3500,VIII.,"It is not a great poem when we measure it by absolute standards, but"
3501,VIII.,"""The Rising Glory of America"" is a very great poem if we view it in"
3502,VIII.,connection with the conditions and the environment that produced it.
3503,VIII.,"Full as it is of Latin influence and Commencement day zeal, it is the"
3504,VIII.,first real poem that America ever made--the first poem that was impelled
3505,VIII.,"hot from a man's soul. It is more than this, it is the first real fruit"
3506,VIII.,of a new influence in the world of letters--the first literary product
3507,VIII.,of that mighty force that was to set in motion the American and French
3508,VIII.,"Revolutions, with all that they mean in human history."
3509,VIII.,
3510,VIII.,"America should have recognized this new and original voice, and should"
3511,VIII.,have encouraged it to sing the new message which it had to proclaim to
3512,VIII.,"the world, but she was not yet ready."
3513,VIII.,
3514,VIII.,"How the young dreamer, who had seen life from his earliest years only"
3515,VIII.,"through the medium of his books, was gradually disillusioned, we have"
3516,VIII.,"endeavored to show. His first book, put forth in the enthusiasm of"
3517,VIII.,"inexperience, with his name on the title-page, was ""damned by all good"
3518,VIII.,"and judicious judges."" So was Wordsworth's; so have been the earliest"
3519,VIII.,ventures of every innovator in the field of song. Gradually the young
3520,VIII.,poet awoke to a realization of his position: America was unprepared for
3521,VIII.,her prophet; she would not listen. The discovery disheartened him; his
3522,VIII.,"Celtic temperament would not patiently wait for recognition, as did"
3523,VIII.,Wordsworth; he was too proud to force his poetry upon an unwilling
3524,VIII.,"public. He would leave the scene, for three years to dwell in the dreamy"
3525,VIII.,seclusion of the tropic islands.
3526,VIII.,
3527,VIII.,"This was his period of pure invention, where he showed the possibilities"
3528,VIII.,"of his genius. With the ""House of Night"" he became one of the earliest"
3529,VIII.,pioneers in that dimly-lighted region which was soon to be exploited by
3530,VIII.,Coleridge and Poe. The poem is the first distinctly romantic note heard
3531,VIII.,"in America. Moreover, one may search in vain in the English poetry of"
3532,VIII.,the early romantic movement for anything that can equal it in strength
3533,VIII.,"of conception, in mastery of weird epithet, and in sustained command"
3534,VIII.,over the vaguely terrible. The page that recounts the poet's departure
3535,VIII.,"from the house of night, quaking with fear,--"
3536,VIII.,
3537,VIII.,"""Beneath my feet substantial darkness lay,"
3538,VIII.,"And screams were heard from the distempered ground,"""
3539,VIII.,
3540,VIII.,his timid look behind him to find the windows of the infernal dome a
3541,VIII.,"""flaming hell-red,"" the fearful shrieks of the dying monster within the"
3542,VIII.,"walls, the ""hell-red wandering light"" that led him to the graves, the"
3543,VIII.,"sudden peal of the iron bell above him in the darkness, and then the"
3544,VIII.,"troop of spectres galloping fiercely on Death's horses, while ""their"
3545,VIII.,"busy eyes shot terror to my soul,""--all this is worthy of Poe. As a"
3546,VIII.,"product of pure imagination, the poem is most remarkable, especially"
3547,VIII.,when we view it in connection with the English literature of its day.
3548,VIII.,"In its weird supernaturalism it anticipated Scott, and in its unearthly"
3549,VIII.,atmosphere it clearly anticipated Coleridge.
3550,VIII.,
3551,VIII.,"In the ""Jamaica Funeral"" the poet outlined his early philosophy of life."
3552,VIII.,"He was fast breaking from the influence of Gray, his early master. It is"
3553,VIII.,a Gallic philosophy that he outlines; he is becoming infected with
3554,VIII.,"Deism; he is a true bacchanalian. Is there not a ring of the ""Rubaiyat"""
3555,VIII.,in a stanza like this:
3556,VIII.,
3557,VIII.,"""Count all the trees that crown Jamaica's hills,"
3558,VIII.,"Count all the stars that through the heavens you see,"
3559,VIII.,"Count every drop that the wide ocean fills,"
3560,VIII.,"Then count the pleasures Bacchus yields to me?"""
3561,VIII.,
3562,VIII.,Freneau's early dream of a purely poetic career was rudely broken by the
3563,VIII.,sudden clash of war and by the sternly practical nature of the American
3564,VIII.,people. Circumstances decided for him his career. There was needed a
3565,VIII.,poetic voice to arouse the common people to action. There was no demand
3566,VIII.,"for an imaginative creator, for a sensuous singer of love and"
3567,VIII.,"wine,--America needed a popular voice, one that could be understood by"
3568,VIII.,"the unlettered, one that with satire and patriotic appeal could arouse"
3569,VIII.,and fire the land. Freneau laid aside for a time the harp and the lyre
3570,VIII.,"and took up the trumpet and the bagpipes, and of his influence on the"
3571,VIII.,stormy period of the Revolution there can be no two opinions. His
3572,VIII.,ballads and satires were scattered far and wide; they were sold in
3573,VIII.,broadsides in every port and city and camp. Even in the war of 1812 his
3574,VIII.,poems flew like leaves everywhere that men were gathered together. To be
3575,VIII.,"the lyrist of a righteous revolution, and above all to be the people's"
3576,VIII.,"poet, is in itself no small distinction."
3577,VIII.,
3578,VIII.,His poems of the war are in themselves a running history of the
3579,VIII.,"struggle, especially of its last years. His heart was in his work; the"
3580,VIII.,prison ship had blotted for a time all memories of the old criticisms of
3581,VIII.,"his early work, all his early dreams, everything save ""the insulting"
3582,VIII.,"foe"" who was making desolate his dear mother land. He lampooned without"
3583,VIII.,"mercy Clinton, Cornwallis, Carleton, and the royalist printers,"
3584,VIII.,Rivington and Gaine. He sang tender lyrics of the patriot dead at Eutaw
3585,VIII.,"Springs, who"
3586,VIII.,
3587,VIII.,"""Saw their injured Country's woe;"
3588,VIII.,"The flaming town, the wasted field;"
3589,VIII.,Then rushed to meet the insulting foe;
3590,VIII.,"They took the spear,--but left the shield."""
3591,VIII.,
3592,VIII.,He sang peans of victory over the downfall at Yorktown; he exalted the
3593,VIII.,fame of Washington; he called down maledictions on the ship that bore
3594,VIII.,"the ""worthless Arnold"" from American shores. These are more than the"
3595,VIII.,"fleeting voices of a newspaper muse; they are true poems, and they are"
3596,VIII.,"American to the core. Scott declared that ""Eutaw Springs [was] as fine a"
3597,VIII.,"thing as there is of the kind in the language."""
3598,VIII.,
3599,VIII.,With a few fiery songs he placed himself at the head of the small group
3600,VIII.,"of naval lyrists, a position which even to-day he has not wholly lost."
3601,VIII.,"In dash and fire, in ability to catch and reproduce the odors and the"
3602,VIII.,"atmosphere of the ocean, in enthusiasm and excitement that is contagious"
3603,VIII.,"and that plunges the reader at once into the heart of the action, and in"
3604,VIII.,"glowing patriotism that makes the poems national hymns, no American poet"
3605,VIII.,has excelled this earliest singer of the American ocean. No true patriot
3606,VIII.,"can read without a thrill of pride such songs as ""Captain Jones's"
3607,VIII.,"Invitation"" and ""The Death of Captain Biddle,"" a song of the intrepid"
3608,VIII.,seaman who from the _Randolph_ poured death into the British ship:
3609,VIII.,
3610,VIII.,"""Tremendous flash! and hark, the ball"
3611,VIII.,"Drives through old Yarmouth, flames and all,"""
3612,VIII.,
3613,VIII.,"and then in a fatal moment was blown up by his own magazine, and"
3614,VIII.,"""Stanzas on the New Frigate Alliance,"" the gallant ship ""who walks the"
3615,VIII.,"ocean like its queen,"" and ""Barney's Victory over the General Monk,"""
3616,VIII.,"that rollicking song of battle and of triumph, and best of all, perhaps,"
3617,VIII.,"""The Sailor's Invitation,"" which is full of the very salt and vigor of"
3618,VIII.,"the western seas. ""The Memorable Victory of Paul Jones,"" written when"
3619,VIII.,"America was ringing with the first news of the battle, is one of the"
3620,VIII.,glories of American literature. Longfellow or Whittier never wrote a
3621,VIII.,more stirring ballad. It moves with leaps and bounds; it is full of the
3622,VIII.,very spirit of battle.
3623,VIII.,
3624,VIII.,"""She felt the fury of her ball,"
3625,VIII.,"Down, prostrate down, the Britons fall;"
3626,VIII.,The decks are strew'd with slain:
3627,VIII.,Jones to the foe his vessel lash'd;
3628,VIII.,And while the black artillery flash'd
3629,VIII.,"Loud thunders shook the main."""
3630,VIII.,
3631,VIII.,It is not impertinent to observe that Thomas Campbell was but four years
3632,VIII.,of age when this appeared. It was not Scott or Cooper who added the
3633,VIII.,domain of the ocean to literature; it was Freneau. His books are full of
3634,VIII.,"the roar and the sweep of the open sea, which he knew as the farmer"
3635,VIII.,knows his ancestral acres. There is no more true and vigorous picture of
3636,VIII.,an ocean voyage and a naval combat than that contained in Canto I of
3637,VIII.,"""The British Prison Ship."" The episode of the boatswain's fiery prayer,"
3638,VIII.,"just before the conflict, is unique in literature."
3639,VIII.,
3640,VIII.,"The war over, Freneau would return to his dream; he would pour forth the"
3641,VIII.,"poetic message that was in him; but his countrymen, delighting in his"
3642,VIII.,"hard blows and biting sarcasm, refused to listen to the merely poetic."
3643,VIII.,They demanded jingles and clever hits. The poet turned fiercely upon
3644,VIII.,"them. ""For men I keep a pen,"" he cried, ""for dogs a cane."" The time for"
3645,VIII.,using the cane was past; he would use it no more. But who would listen
3646,VIII.,to anything that was not rant and bombast? Fate had thrown him into a
3647,VIII.,"""bard-baiting clime."" A wave of the old bitterness swept over him:"
3648,VIII.,
3649,VIII.,"""Expect not in these times of rude renown"
3650,VIII.,That verse like yours will have the chance to please:
3651,VIII.,"No taste for plaintive elegy is known,"
3652,VIII.,"Nor lyric ode,--none care for things like these."""
3653,VIII.,
3654,VIII.,"How he at length deliberately turned from the muse of his choice, and"
3655,VIII.,how after a long experience with the world of actual affairs he
3656,VIII.,exchanged his old poetic ideals for those of mere reason and common
3657,VIII.,"sense, we have attempted to show."
3658,VIII.,
3659,VIII.,"Here was a man equipped by nature for a true poet, a man with a message,"
3660,VIII.,yet dwarfed and transformed by his environment. America was not ready
3661,VIII.,for her singer. It took half a century more to make way in the
3662,VIII.,wilderness for the new message that had been whispered to Freneau in his
3663,VIII.,"young manhood. Had he been a great world-poet, he would have been heard"
3664,VIII.,despite all difficulties; he would have trampled down the barriers about
3665,VIII.,"him and have compelled his age to listen, but the task was beyond him."
3666,VIII.,"America, to this day, has produced no poet who single-handed and alone"
3667,VIII.,could have performed such a labor of Hercules. Sadly Freneau turned to
3668,VIII.,other things.
3669,VIII.,
3670,VIII.,He has never been adequately recognized. Had the first edition of his
3671,VIII.,"poems, published the same year as the Kilmarnock edition of Burns, been"
3672,VIII.,"an English book, it long ago would have figured largely in the histories"
3673,VIII.,of the romantic and naturalistic movement which made possible the great
3674,VIII.,outburst of the nineteenth century. That Freneau was the most
3675,VIII.,conspicuous pioneer in the dim romantic world that was to be explored by
3676,VIII.,"Coleridge and Poe, we have already shown; that he was a pioneer in the"
3677,VIII.,movement that succeeded in throwing off the chain forged by Pope is
3678,VIII.,"evident to any one who will examine his early work. ""The Wild Honey"
3679,VIII.,"Suckle,"" for instance, which was written in 1786, twelve years before"
3680,VIII.,"the ""Lyrical Ballads,"" is as spontaneous and as free from Pope as"
3681,VIII.,anything written by Wordsworth. It is a nature lyric written with the
3682,VIII.,"eye upon the object, without recollection of other poetry, and it draws"
3683,VIII.,from the humble flower a lesson for humanity in the true Wordsworthian
3684,VIII.,"manner. Before Freneau, American poetry had been full of the eglantine,"
3685,VIII.,"the yew, the Babylonian willow, the lark--the flora and fauna of the"
3686,VIII.,"Hebrew and British bards. In our poet we find, for the first time, the"
3687,VIII.,"actual life of the American forest and field--the wild pink, the elm,"
3688,VIII.,"the wild honeysuckle, the pumpkin, the blackbird, the squirrel, the"
3689,VIII.,"partridge, ""the loquacious whip-poor-will,"" and in addition to this the"
3690,VIII.,varied life of the American tropic islands. We find for the first time
3691,VIII.,examples of that true poetic spirit that can find inspiration in humble
3692,VIII.,"and even vulgar things; that, furthermore, can draw from lowly nature"
3693,VIII.,and her commonplaces deep lessons for human life. Freneau sees the
3694,VIII.,"reflection of the stars in the bosom of the river,"
3695,VIII.,
3696,VIII.,"""But when the tide had ebbed away"
3697,VIII.,"The scene fantastic with it fled,"
3698,VIII.,A bank of mud around me lay
3699,VIII.,"And sea-weed on the river's bed,"""
3700,VIII.,
3701,VIII.,and from this he draws the obvious moral for human life. Consider what
3702,VIII.,"Pope would have said of mud. Indeed, to appreciate Freneau, one must"
3703,VIII.,come to him after a careful reading of the classic poets who preceded
3704,VIII.,him. What a shock to this school would have been the vividly realistic
3705,VIII.,"poem on ""Logtown."" Just how much Freneau influenced the school of poets"
3706,VIII.,"who in England broke away from the trammels of the eighteenth century,"
3707,VIII.,we can never know; yet no one can read long in the American poet and not
3708,VIII.,be convinced that his influence was considerable. His poems were known
3709,VIII.,and read freely in England at the very dawn of the critical period in
3710,VIII.,"British poetry, and their echoes can be detected more than once."
3711,VIII.,
3712,VIII.,In his use of his native land and his familiar surroundings as a
3713,VIII.,"background for art, Freneau discovered the poetical side of the Indian,"
3714,VIII.,"and thus became the literary father of Brockden Brown, Cooper, and the"
3715,VIII.,little school of poets which in the early years of the century fondly
3716,VIII.,believed that the aboriginal American was to be the central figure in
3717,VIII.,the poetry of the new world. To the little real poetry that there is in
3718,VIII.,"the Indian, Freneau did full justice, but he went to no such absurd"
3719,VIII.,"lengths as did Eastburn and Whittier. The ""Indian Death Song,"" if it"
3720,VIII.,"indeed be his, is full of the wild, stoical heroism of the brave who is"
3721,VIII.,"dying beneath the torture of his enemies. In ""The Indian Student"" he has"
3722,VIII.,"covered fully the Indian's love for the pathless forest, and to the"
3723,VIII.,"untamable wildness of his nature. ""The Dying Indian"" and ""The Indian"
3724,VIII.,"Burying-Ground"" sum up what is essentially poetic in Indian legend and"
3725,VIII.,"all that is pathetic in the fate of the vanishing race. Poetry, if it is"
3726,VIII.,"to confine itself to the truth, can do little more for the Indian."
3727,VIII.,
3728,VIII.,"Such was Philip Freneau, a man in every respect worthy to bear the title"
3729,VIII.,"of ""the father of American poetry."" He was the first true poet born upon"
3730,VIII.,our continent; he realized in his early youth his vocation; he gave
3731,VIII.,himself with vigor and enthusiasm to his calling; he fitted himself by
3732,VIII.,wide reading and classic culture; he received the full inspiration of a
3733,VIII.,"great movement in human society; he lifted up his voice to sing, but he"
3734,VIII.,was smothered and silenced by his contemporaries. He was all alone; he
3735,VIII.,"had about him no circle of ""Pleiades"" to encourage and assist; he had no"
3736,VIII.,"traditions, religious or otherwise, that would compel silence. He was"
3737,VIII.,out of step with the theology of his generation; he was out of tune with
3738,VIII.,the music of his day; he was beating time a half century ahead of the
3739,VIII.,"chorus about him. The people have to be educated to revolution, and"
3740,VIII.,America had not yet learned to take the initiative in things
3741,VIII.,intellectual and æsthetic. She must follow the literary fashions beyond
3742,VIII.,the sea. Freneau was for breaking violently away from England and for
3743,VIII.,setting up a new standard of culture and literary art on this side the
3744,VIII.,water.
3745,VIII.,
3746,VIII.,"""Can we never be thought"
3747,VIII.,To have learning or grace
3748,VIII.,Unless it be brought
3749,VIII.,"From that damnable place?"""
3750,VIII.,
3751,VIII.,he cried. But he reckoned without his countrymen. Not until Emerson's
3752,VIII.,day did it dawn upon America that it was possible for her to think for
3753,VIII.,herself and make poetry that did not echo the English bards. Thus did
3754,VIII.,America reject her earliest prophet; thus did she stop her ears and
3755,VIII.,compel him to lay aside his seven-stringed lyre for the horn and the
3756,VIII.,bagpipes.
3757,VIII.,
3758,VIII.,"Freneau lived to see his discarded harp in full tune in other hands,"
3759,VIII.,first in England and then in his own land. There is something truly
3760,VIII.,"pathetic in the figure of the old minstrel, who had realized almost"
3761,VIII.,"nothing of his early dreams, and yet who had been told by the great"
3762,VIII.,Jeffries that the time would surely come when his poems would command a
3763,VIII.,"commentator like Gray, who had been extravagantly praised by such"
3764,VIII.,"masters as Scott and Campbell, who had written to Madison as late as"
3765,VIII.,"1815, ""my publisher tells me the town will have them [his verses] and of"
3766,VIII.,"course have them they will,"" it is pathetic to see this poet, in his"
3767,VIII.,"hoary old age, for he lived until 1832, realizing that he had been"
3768,VIII.,"utterly forgotten, witnessing the triumph of the very songs that had"
3769,VIII.,"haunted his youth, and seeing those who had not half his native ability"
3770,VIII.,crowned by those who had rejected and forgotten him. Such ever is the
3771,VIII.,penalty of being born out of due time.
3772,VIII.,
3773,VIII.,The present age has also been unjust to Freneau. It has left his poems
3774,VIII.,"in their first editions, which are now extremely rare and costly; it has"
3775,VIII.,scattered his letters and papers to the winds; it has garbled and
3776,VIII.,distorted his life in every book of reference; it has left untold the
3777,VIII.,true story of his career; it has judged him from generalizations that
3778,VIII.,have floated from no one knows where. But time works slowly with her
3779,VIII.,verdicts; true merit in the end is sure to receive its deserts; and
3780,VIII.,Freneau may even yet be given the place that is his.

4831,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"As late in fair Sicilia's groves I stray'd,"
4832,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Charm'd with the beauties of the vernal scene
4833,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"I sate me down amid the yew tree's shade,"
4834,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Flowers  blooming  round,  with  herbage fresh and green."
4835,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],
4836,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Not distant far a monument arose
4837,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Among the trees and form'd of Parian stone,"
4838,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"And, as if there some stranger did repose,"
4839,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"It stood neglected, and it stood alone."
4840,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],
4841,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Along its sides dependent ivy crept,"
4842,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"The cypress bough, Plutonian green, was near,"
4843,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"A sculptur'd Venus on the summit wept,"
4844,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],A pensive Cupid dropt the parting tear.
4845,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],
4846,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Strains deep engrav'd on every side I read,"
4847,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],How Phaon died upon that foreign shore--
4848,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Sappho, I think your Phaon must be dead,"
4849,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Then hear the strains that do his fate deplore:
4850,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],
4851,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Thou swain that lov'st the morning air,"
4852,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"To those embowering trees repair,"

4854,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"And of this landscape to grow fonder,"
4855,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Still, O still persist to wander"
4856,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Up and down the flowery lawn;
4857,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],And as you there enraptur'd rove
4858,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"From hill to hill, from grove to grove,"
4859,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Pensive now and quite alone,"
4860,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Cast thine eye upon this stone,"
4861,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Read its melancholy moan;

4864,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Whom the Lesbians held so dear,"
4865,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Nature calls thee not her own.

4868,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Tell the far off mountain caves
4869,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],(Wrapt in solitary shade);
4870,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Tell them in high tragic numbers,"
4871,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"That beneath this marble tomb,"
4872,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Shrouded in unceasing gloom
4873,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Phaon, youthful Phaon, slumbers,"
4874,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],By Sicilian swains deplor'd--
4875,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],That a narrow urn restrains
4876,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Him who charm'd our pleasing plains,"
4877,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Him, whom every nymph ador'd."
4878,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Tell the woods and tell the waves,"

4884,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Phoebus, native of the sphere,"
4885,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],High the burning zenith run;
4886,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Then our much lamented swain,"
4887,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"O'er the sunny, scorched plain,"
4888,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Hunting with a chosen train,"
4889,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Slew the monsters of the waste
4890,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],From those gloomy caverns chac'd
4891,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Round stupendous Etna plac'd.--
4892,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Conquer'd by the solar beam
4893,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],At last he came to yonder stream;
4894,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Panting, thirsting there he lay"
4895,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"On this fatal summer's day,"
4896,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],While his locks of raven jett
4897,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Were on his temples dripping wet;
4898,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],The gentle stream ran purling by
4899,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"O'er the pebbles, pleasantly,"
4900,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Tempting him to drink and die--
4901,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],He drank indeed--but never thought
4902,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Death was in the gelid draught!--
4903,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Soon it chill'd his boiling veins,"
4904,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Soon this glory of the plains
4905,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Left the nymphs and left the swains,"
4906,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],And has fled with all his charms
4907,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Where the Stygian monarch reigns,"
4908,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Where no sun the climate warms!--
4909,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Dread Pluto then, as once before,"
4910,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Pass'd Avernus' waters o'er;
4911,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Left the dark and dismal shore,"
4912,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"And strait enamour'd, as he gloomy stood,"
4913,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Seiz'd Phaon by the waters of the wood.
4914,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Now o'er the silent plain
4915,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"We for our much lov'd Phaon call again,"
4916,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],And Phaon! Phaon! ring the woods amain--
4917,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"From beneath this myrtle tree,"
4918,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Musidora, wretched maid,"
4919,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"How shall Phaon answer thee,"
4920,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Deep in vaulted caverns laid!--
4921,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Thrice the myrtle tree hath bloom'd
4922,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Since our Phaon was entomb'd,"
4923,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"I, who had his heart, below,"
4924,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"I have rais'd this turret high,"
4925,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],A monument of love and woe
4926,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],That Phaon's name may never die.--
4927,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"With deepest grief, O muse divine,"
4928,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Around his tomb thy laurels twine
4929,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"And shed thy sorrow, for to morrow"

4939,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Than those that in thy native Lesbos grow--

4944,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"So soft, so sweet, so charming and so kind,"
4945,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"A face so fair, such beauties of the mind--"
4946,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Not Musidora can be rank'd with me
4947,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],Who sings so well thy funeral song for thee!--[34]
4948,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],I'll go!--and from the high Leucadian steep
4949,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"Take my last farewell in the lover's leap,"
4950,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"I charge thee, Phaon, by this deed of woe"
4951,THE MONUMENT OF PHAON[33],"To meet me in the Elysian shades below,"

5154,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,O free from thy despotic sway
5155,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"This nymph of heaven-descended charms,"
5156,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Too soon she came this dusky way--
5157,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Restore thy captive to my arms!
5158,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,
5159,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,As by a stream's fair verdant side
5160,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"In myrtle shades she roved along,"
5161,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"A serpent stung my blooming bride,"
5162,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,This brightest of the female throng--
5163,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,The venom hastening thro' her veins
5164,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Forbade the freezing blood to flow.
5165,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,And thus she left the Thracian plains
5166,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,For these dejected groves below.
5167,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,
5168,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"Even thou may'st pity my sad pain,"
5169,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"Since Love, as ancient stories say,"
5170,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"Forced thee to leave thy native reign,"
5171,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,And in Sicilian meadows stray:
5172,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"Bright Proserpine thy bosom fired,"
5173,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"For her you sought unwelcome light,"
5174,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Madness and love in you conspired
5175,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,To seize her to the shades of night.
5176,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,
5177,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"But if, averse to my request,"
5178,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"The banished nymph, for whom I mourn,"
5179,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"Must in Plutonian chambers rest,"
5180,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,And never to my arms return----
5181,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Take Orpheus too--his warm desire
5182,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,Can ne'er be quench'd by your decree:
5183,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,"In life or death he must admire,"
5184,THE PRAYER OF ORPHEUS,He must adore Eurydicè!

5192,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],This antique dome the insatiate tooth of time
5193,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Now level with the dust has almost laid;--
5194,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Yet ere 'tis gone, I seize my humble theme"
5195,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"From these low ruins, that his years have made."
5196,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5197,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Behold the unsocial hearth!--where once the fires
5198,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Blazed high, and soothed the storm-stay'd traveller's woes;"
5199,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"See! the weak roof, that abler props requires,"
5200,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Admits the winds, and swift descending snows."
5201,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5202,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Here, to forget the labours of the day,"
5203,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"No more the swains at evening hours repair,"
5204,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],But wandering flocks assume the well known way
5205,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],To shun the rigours of the midnight air.
5206,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5207,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"In yonder chamber, half to ruin gone,"
5208,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Once stood the ancient housewife's curtained bed--
5209,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Timely the prudent matron has withdrawn,"
5210,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],And each domestic comfort with her fled.
5211,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5212,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"The trees, the flowers that her own hands had reared,"
5213,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"The plants, the vines, that were so verdant seen,--"
5214,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"The trees, the flowers, the vines have disappear'd,"
5215,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],And every plant has vanish'd from the green.
5216,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5217,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],So sits in tears on wide Campania's plain
5218,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Rome, once the mistress of a world enslaved;"
5219,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"That triumph'd o'er the land, subdued the main,"
5220,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"And Time himself, in her wild transports, braved."
5221,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5222,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],So sits in tears on Palestina's shore
5223,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"The Hebrew town, of splendour once divine--"
5224,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Her kings, her lords, her triumphs are no more;"
5225,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Slain are her priests, and ruin'd every shrine."
5226,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5227,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Once, in the bounds of this deserted room,"
5228,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Perhaps some swain nocturnal courtship made,"
5229,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Perhaps some Sherlock mused amidst the gloom;
5230,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Since Love and Death forever seek the shade.
5231,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5232,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Perhaps some miser, doom'd to discontent,"
5233,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Here counted o'er the heaps acquired with pain;
5234,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"He to the dust--his gold, on traffick sent,"
5235,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Shall ne'er disgrace these mouldering walls again.
5236,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5237,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Nor shall the glow-worm fopling, sunshine bred,"
5238,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Seek, at the evening hour this wonted dome--"
5239,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"Time has reduced the fabrick to a shed,"
5240,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Scarce fit to be the wandering beggar's home.
5241,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5242,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],And none but I its dismal case lament--
5243,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"None, none but I o'er its cold relics mourn,"
5244,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],Sent by the muse--(the time perhaps misspent)--
5245,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],To write dull stanzas on this dome forlorn.
5246,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5247,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],
5248,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],[36] The first trace that I can find of this poem is in the _Freeman's

5253,THE DESERTED FARM-HOUSE[36],"was widely copied. The _Independent Gazetteer_ printed it in 1787,"

5548,ARGUMENT,"These shores so long unknown--through various toils,"
5549,ARGUMENT,"Famine, and death, the hero forced his way,"

5591,ARGUMENT,"This earth, say they, nor hills nor mountains knew"

5606,ARGUMENT,"Reserved for men of deeper thought, and late,"
5607,ARGUMENT,"Presents itself to view:--In Peleg's days,"
5608,ARGUMENT,(So says the Hebrew seer's unerring pen)
5609,ARGUMENT,"This mighty mass of earth, this solid globe,"
5610,ARGUMENT,"Was cleft in twain,--""divided"" east and west,                     65"

5612,ARGUMENT,"Through the vast chasm, and laved the solid world;"
5613,ARGUMENT,And traces indisputable remain
5614,ARGUMENT,Of this primæval land now sunk and lost.--
5615,ARGUMENT,The islands rising in our eastern main                            70
5616,ARGUMENT,"Are but small fragments of this continent,"
5617,ARGUMENT,Whose two extremities were Newfoundland
5618,ARGUMENT,"And St. Helena.--One far in the north,"
5619,ARGUMENT,Where shivering seamen view with strange surprize
5620,ARGUMENT,The guiding pole-star glittering o'er their heads;                75
5621,ARGUMENT,The other near the southern tropic rears
5622,ARGUMENT,"Its head above the waves--Bermuda's isles,"
5623,ARGUMENT,"Cape Verd, Canary, Britain, and the Azores,"
5624,ARGUMENT,"With fam'd Hibernia, are but broken parts"

5641,ARGUMENT,"The Carthagenians, ere the Roman yoke"
5642,ARGUMENT,"Broke their proud spirits, and enslaved them too,"
5643,ARGUMENT,For navigation were renowned as much                              95
5644,ARGUMENT,As haughty Tyre with all her hundred fleets.
5645,ARGUMENT,Full many a league their venturous seamen sailed
5646,ARGUMENT,"Through streight Gibraltar, down the western shore"
5647,ARGUMENT,"Of Africa, to the Canary isles:"
5648,ARGUMENT,By them called Fortunate; so Flaccus sings.                      100
5649,ARGUMENT,Because eternal spring there clothes the fields
5650,ARGUMENT,And fruits delicious bloom throughout the year.--
5651,ARGUMENT,"From voyaging here, this inference I draw,"
5652,ARGUMENT,Perhaps some barque with all her numerous crew
5653,ARGUMENT,"Falling to leeward of her destined port,                         105"
5654,ARGUMENT,"Caught by the eastern Trade, was hurried on"
5655,ARGUMENT,"Before the unceasing blast to Indian isles,"
5656,ARGUMENT,"Brazil, La Plata, or the coasts more south--"
5657,ARGUMENT,"There stranded, and unable to return,"
5658,ARGUMENT,Forever from their native skies estranged.                       110
5659,ARGUMENT,"Doubtless they made these virgin climes their own,"
5660,ARGUMENT,And in the course of long revolving years
5661,ARGUMENT,"A numerous progeny from these arose,"
5662,ARGUMENT,And spread throughout the coasts--those whom we call
5663,ARGUMENT,"Brazilians, Mexicans, Peruvians rich,                            115"
5664,ARGUMENT,"The tribes of Chili, Patagon, and those"

5666,ARGUMENT,"When first the power of Europe here attained,"
5667,ARGUMENT,"Vast empires, kingdoms, cities, palaces"

5669,ARGUMENT,"Who has not heard of Cusco, Lima, and"
5670,ARGUMENT,The town of Mexico--huge cities form'd
5671,ARGUMENT,From Indian architecture; ere the arms
5672,ARGUMENT,Of haughty Spain disturb'd the peaceful soil?--
5673,ARGUMENT,"But here, amid this northern dark domain,                        125"
5674,ARGUMENT,No towns were seen to rise.--No arts were here;
5675,ARGUMENT,"The tribes unskill'd to raise the lofty mast,"
5676,ARGUMENT,"Or force the daring prow thro' adverse waves,"
5677,ARGUMENT,"Gazed on the pregnant soil, and craved alone"
5678,ARGUMENT,"Life from the unaided genius of the ground,--                    130"
5679,ARGUMENT,This indicates they were a different race;
5680,ARGUMENT,"From whom descended, 'tis not ours to say--"

5710,ARGUMENT,Secure from tyranny and base controul.
5711,ARGUMENT,"For this they left their country and their friends,"

5715,ARGUMENT,"Hence, by the care of each adventurous chief"
5716,ARGUMENT,New governments (their wealth unenvied yet)

6986,DISCOVERY[47],And where the wintry suns expend their fire;
6987,DISCOVERY[47],"What land to land protracts the varied scene,"
6988,DISCOVERY[47],And what extended oceans roll between;
6989,DISCOVERY[47],"What worlds exist beneath antarctic skies,"
6990,DISCOVERY[47],And from Pacific waves what verdant islands rise.
6991,DISCOVERY[47],In vain did Nature shore from shore divide:

6993,DISCOVERY[47],When his bold plan the master pilot drew

7017,DISCOVERY[47],"How few have sailed on virtue's nobler plan,"
7018,DISCOVERY[47],How few with motives worthy of a man!--
7019,DISCOVERY[47],While through the deep-sea waves we saw them go
7020,DISCOVERY[47],Where'er they found a man they made a foe;
7021,DISCOVERY[47],"Superior only by superior art,"
7022,DISCOVERY[47],"Forgot the social virtues of the heart,"
7023,DISCOVERY[47],"Forgetting still, where'er they madly ran,"

7028,DISCOVERY[47],"They left no native master of his clime,"
7029,DISCOVERY[47],"His trees, his towns, with hardened front they claimed,"
7030,DISCOVERY[47],Seized every region that a despot named
7031,DISCOVERY[47],And forced the oath that bound him to obey
7032,DISCOVERY[47],"Some prince unknown, ten thousand miles away."
7033,DISCOVERY[47],"Slaves to their passions, man's imperious race,"
7034,DISCOVERY[47],"Born for contention, find no resting place,"
7035,DISCOVERY[47],"And the vain mind, bewildered and perplext,"
7036,DISCOVERY[47],Makes this world wretched to enjoy the next.
7037,DISCOVERY[47],"Tired of the scenes that Nature made their own,"
7038,DISCOVERY[47],They rove to conquer what remains unknown:
7039,DISCOVERY[47],"Avarice, undaunted, claims whate'er she sees,"
7040,DISCOVERY[47],"Surmounts earth's circle, and foregoes all ease:"
7041,DISCOVERY[47],"Religion, bolder, sends some sacred chief"
7042,DISCOVERY[47],To bend the nations to her own belief.
7043,DISCOVERY[47],"To their vain standard Europe's sons invite,"
7044,DISCOVERY[47],Who hold no other world can think aright.
7045,DISCOVERY[47],"Behold their varied tribes, with self applause,"
7046,DISCOVERY[47],"First in religion, liberty, and laws,"
7047,DISCOVERY[47],"And while they bow to cruelty and blood,"
7048,DISCOVERY[47],Condemn the Indian with his milder god.--
7049,DISCOVERY[47],"Ah, race to justice, truth, and honour blind,"
7050,DISCOVERY[47],Are thy convictions to convert mankind!--
7051,DISCOVERY[47],"Vain pride--convince them that your own are just,"
7052,DISCOVERY[47],"Or leave them happy, as you found them first."
7053,DISCOVERY[47],What charm is seen through Europe's realms of strife
7054,DISCOVERY[47],That adds new blessings to the savage life?--
7055,DISCOVERY[47],"On them warm suns with equal splendor shine,"
7056,DISCOVERY[47],"Their each domestic pleasure equals thine,"
7057,DISCOVERY[47],"Their native groves as soft a bloom display,"
7058,DISCOVERY[47],"As self-contented roll their lives away,"
7059,DISCOVERY[47],"And the gay soul, in fancy's visions blest,"
7060,DISCOVERY[47],Leaves to the care of chance her heaven of rest.
7061,DISCOVERY[47],What are the arts that rise on Europe's plan
7062,DISCOVERY[47],But arts destructive to the bliss of man?
7063,DISCOVERY[47],"What are all wars, where'er the marks you trace,"
7064,DISCOVERY[47],But the sad records of our world's disgrace?
7065,DISCOVERY[47],"Reason degraded from her tottering throne,"
7066,DISCOVERY[47],"And precepts, called divine, observed by none."
7067,DISCOVERY[47],"Blest in their distance from that bloody scene,"
7068,DISCOVERY[47],Why spread the sail to pass the gulphs between?--
7069,DISCOVERY[47],"If winds can waft to ocean's utmost verge,"
7070,DISCOVERY[47],And there new islands and new worlds emerge--
7071,DISCOVERY[47],"If wealth, or war, or science bid thee roam,"
7072,DISCOVERY[47],"Ah, leave religion and thy laws at home,"
7073,DISCOVERY[47],"Leave the free native to enjoy his store,"
7074,DISCOVERY[47],"Nor teach destructive arts, unknown before--"
7075,DISCOVERY[47],"Woes of their own those new found worlds invade,"
7076,DISCOVERY[47],"There, too, fierce passions the weak soul degrade,"
7077,DISCOVERY[47],"Invention there has winged the unerring dart,"
7078,DISCOVERY[47],There the swift arrow vibrates to the heart.
7079,DISCOVERY[47],"Revenge and death contending bosoms share,"
7080,DISCOVERY[47],And pining envy claims her subjects there.
7081,DISCOVERY[47],Are these too few?--then see despotic power
7082,DISCOVERY[47],Spends on a throne of logs her busy hour.
7083,DISCOVERY[47],"Hard by, and half ambitious to ascend,"
7084,DISCOVERY[47],"Priests, interceding with the gods, attend--"
7085,DISCOVERY[47],"Atoning victims at their shrines they lay,"
7086,DISCOVERY[47],"Their crimson knives tremendous rites display,"
7087,DISCOVERY[47],Or the proud despot's gore remorseless shed.
7088,DISCOVERY[47],"Through life detested, or adored when dead."
7089,DISCOVERY[47],"Born to be wretched, search this globe around,"
7090,DISCOVERY[47],Dupes to a few the race of man is found!
7091,DISCOVERY[47],"Seek some new world in some new climate plac'd,"
7092,DISCOVERY[47],"Some gay Ta-ia[A] on the watery waste,"
7093,DISCOVERY[47],"Though Nature clothes in all her bright array,"
7094,DISCOVERY[47],Some proud tormentor steals her charms away:
7095,DISCOVERY[47],"Howe'er she smiles beneath those milder skies,"
7096,DISCOVERY[47],Though men decay the monarch never dies!
7097,DISCOVERY[47],"Howe'er the groves, howe'er the gardens bloom,"
7098,DISCOVERY[47],A monarch and a priest is still their doom!

8534,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,So unhappy to be--far away from his chest.
8535,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,He was all on the fidgets to be with his gold:

8538,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,Old Satan--oh no--take it some other way--
8539,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"The God of this world had him fast by a chain,"

8589,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"A cause against Smyth[B] he could never defend,"
8590,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,As well might the Old One with Michael contend:
8591,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"The road was before him, the country was spacious,"
8592,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,And he knew an old fellow called _fieri facias_:--

8599,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Here was Pedro, the parson, who looked full as grave"

8604,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He talked with Scalpella, the inn-holder's wife,"
8605,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Then dwelt on her beauties, and called her his life!--"
8606,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,He ogled Scalpella!--and spake of her charms;
8607,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,And oh! how he wished to repose in her arms:
8608,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He called her his deary, and talked of their loves;"
8609,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,And left her at last--a pair of old gloves!
8610,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,I was sorry to see him deranged and perplext

8621,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Or, at least, that the prospect was distant and dim."
8622,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"So I saw him pack up his polemical gown,"
8623,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,To retreat while he could from the noise of the town.[C]
8624,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He said there was something in Falls he admired,"
8625,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,But of constantly hearing the roar--he was tired!

8627,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He would come the next spring with his surplice new trimmed,"
8628,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,Besides there were fogs in the morning (he said)
8629,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,That rose on the river and muddled his head!--
8630,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Thus he quitted Passaick!--deserted her shore,"

8637,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"With as many, at least, as three devils therein."
8638,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He quarrelled with Jack, and he wrangled with Tom,"

8643,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,That his honour would hardly be chosen again.
8644,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"He fought with Tim Tearcoat, and cudgelled with Ben,"
8645,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,And wrestled with Sampson--all quarrelsome men;--

8647,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,On fellows who kicked with the heels of a horse.
8648,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Tho' strong in my arms, and of strength to contest"
8649,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"With the youths of my age in the wars of the fist,"
8650,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,I thought it was better to let them pursue

8652,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"I saw it was madness to join in the fray,"
8653,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,So I left them to wrangle--each dog his own way.

8722,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"'Till care was dismissed and solicitude drowned,"
8723,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,And a reckoning was brought him of more than three pound.
8724,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"As he had not a groat in his lank looking purse,"
8725,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,The landlord made seizure of saddle and horse:--

8824,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"publication or a contribution to a newspaper. As far as I can find, the"
8825,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,poem is unique in the edition of 1809.

8829,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,be verified. He writes:

8831,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"""There were but two taverns at the Passaic Falls at that time; one kept"
8832,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"by Abraham Godwin, the other by James Leslie. Godwin and three of his"
8833,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"sons went in the American Army at the beginning of the Revolution, and"
8834,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,he died in the service. His widow survived him and carried on the tavern
8835,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,for a number of years. She had an intolerant hatred of all Tories. In
8836,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"1776 Leslie was keeping a tavern at the present Passaic, a few miles"
8837,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"below the Passaic Falls, and he continued there during the greater part"
8838,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"of the Revolution, I think."

8840,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"""The character of the tavern-keeper's wife, 'Scalpella,' is either"
8841,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,purely fictitious or based on the character of some other person.
8842,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Moreover, I do not think Passaic Falls was ever a summer resort of the"
8843,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,character depicted in this poem. Travellers merely went there to see the
8844,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Falls, occasionally staying over night, but I cannot think it possible"
8845,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,that there could have been such a party assembled there at one time as
8846,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,indicated in the poem. I do not think the two taverns together could
8847,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,have accommodated so many people. The place was never called 'Passaic
8848,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Village,' as stated in the note, but was known as Totown Bridge until"
8849,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"1792, when Paterson was founded. Passaic Village was the name given"
8850,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,about forty years ago to the present city of Passaic.
8851,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,
8852,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"""The only allusions in the poem which have some semblance of reality are"
8853,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"the references to 'Miss Kitty,' by whom is perhaps meant the daughter of"
8854,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Lord Stirling; and 'Liberty Hall,' the residence of her uncle, Gov."
8855,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"Livingstone, near Elizabethtown. There was no such person as 'Gubbins.'"
8856,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"I should think that the scene of the poem, if it has any foundation"
8857,CHARACTERS OF THE POEM,"whatever in fact, was more probably laid somewhere near Philadelphia."""

9340,ARGUMENT,"was conducted in midsummer, against a city which lies just within the"
9341,ARGUMENT,tropic. The country around the Moro Castle is rocky. To bind and carry
9342,ARGUMENT,the fascines was of itself a work of incredible labor;... sufficient
9343,ARGUMENT,earth to hold the fascines firm was gathered with difficulty from the
9344,ARGUMENT,"crevices of the rocks. Once, after a drought of fourteen days, the grand"
9345,ARGUMENT,"battery took fire from the flames, and crackling and spreading where"
9346,ARGUMENT,"water could not follow it, nor earth stifle it, was wholly consumed. The"
9347,ARGUMENT,"climate spoiled a great part of the provisions. Wanting good water, many"
9348,ARGUMENT,died in agonies of thirst. More fell victims of a putrid fever....
9349,ARGUMENT,Hundreds of carcasses floated on the ocean. And yet such was the
9350,ARGUMENT,"enthusiasm of the English, such the resolute zeal of the sailors and"
9351,ARGUMENT,"soldiers, such the unity of action between the fleet and army, that the"
9352,ARGUMENT,"vertical sun of June and July, the heavy rains of August, raging fever,"
9353,ARGUMENT,"and strong and well defended fortresses, all the obstacles of nature and"
9354,ARGUMENT,"art were surmounted, and the most decisive victory of the war was"
9355,ARGUMENT,"gained."""

9911,EPILOGUE,[85] Text from the edition of 1809. The poem was first published in New
9912,EPILOGUE,"York in 1775 by Anderson, under the title, ""A Voyage to Boston, a poem,"""
9913,EPILOGUE,and a second edition was printed the same year in Philadelphia for
9914,EPILOGUE,William Woodhouse. The revision of the poem in the 1786 edition of
9915,EPILOGUE,"Freneau's works mentions that the poem was published in September, 1775."
9916,EPILOGUE,"This is evidently a mistake. In the issue of October 21, of Anderson's"
9917,EPILOGUE,"_Constitutional Gazette,_ appears the advertisement, ""This day is"

9919,EPILOGUE,"The copy of the poem in possession of the Library Company, Philadelphia,"

9927,ARGUMENT,
9928,ARGUMENT,Introductory reflections. A traveller undertakes a voyage to
9929,ARGUMENT,Boston: arrives in a river of Massachusetts: has there a sight of
9930,ARGUMENT,"the native Genius of North-America, who presents him with a mantle,"
9931,ARGUMENT,and acquaints him with its virtue of rendering the wearer
9932,ARGUMENT,invisible; desires him to visit the town in that state and remark
9933,ARGUMENT,the transactions there. Accordingly he arrives at General Gage's
9934,ARGUMENT,"mansion, where are several other ministerial tools sitting in"
9935,ARGUMENT,council. The striking similarity of Gage's temper and conduct to
9936,ARGUMENT,"that of Hernando Cortez. Some account of Cortez, and his horrid"
9937,ARGUMENT,"devastations in Mexico, &c. The traveller enters their junto, and"
9938,ARGUMENT,"gives an account of the chief members of it, viz., General Gage,"
9939,ARGUMENT,"Admiral Greaves, General Burgoyne, Lord Percy, General Howe, Capt."
9940,ARGUMENT,"Wallace, and a numerous fry of dependents and needy favourites"
9941,ARGUMENT,"waiting for posts and estates in America, as soon as they shall"
9942,ARGUMENT,have compelled us to resign our liberties: General Gage's surprize
9943,ARGUMENT,"at their several defeats in New-England, and questions his leaders"
9944,ARGUMENT,thereupon. Lord Percy's answer: Greaves's reply to that nobleman:
9945,ARGUMENT,"Gage's raillery upon Percy for his nimble retreat on April 19,"
9946,ARGUMENT,"1775. Percy's defence of his conduct on that day, and the reason of"
9947,ARGUMENT,"his activity; and desires them to forget Lexington for the present,"
9948,ARGUMENT,and turn their eyes to the late loss at Bunker's Hill. General
9949,ARGUMENT,"Howe's speech concerning that action. Burgoyne's harrangue, with"
9950,ARGUMENT,"his invectives against Colonel Grant, who ""pledged himself for the"
9951,ARGUMENT,"general cowardice of all America:"" Gage's brief reply; and"
9952,ARGUMENT,"communicates his intention of purloining cattle from the islands,"
9953,ARGUMENT,and plans that right honourable exploit; but being overcome by
9954,ARGUMENT,"sleep, dismisses his counsellors. The cutting down the Liberty Tree"
9955,ARGUMENT,"in Boston, and untimely end of one of the wretches employed in that"
9956,ARGUMENT,sneaking affair. Distresses of the imprisoned citizens in Boston.
9957,ARGUMENT,"Dissection of a Tory. The traveller leaves Boston, and visits the"
9958,ARGUMENT,Provincial Camp; meets the Genius of America again on the way and
9959,ARGUMENT,"resigns the mantle, whereby he again becomes visible; arrives at"
9960,ARGUMENT,"the camp. View of the Rifle-men, Virginians, &c. Speech of an"
9961,ARGUMENT,"American soldier; his determined resolution, which is that of all"
9962,ARGUMENT,"America, to defend our rights and privileges. Grief that he must"
9963,ARGUMENT,fight against our own nation. Mention of Carleton and Johnson;
9964,ARGUMENT,"concludes with a melancholy recital of our present distractions,"
9965,ARGUMENT,and sincere hope of reconcilation with Great Britain before a
9966,ARGUMENT,wicked ministry render it too late. Conclusion.
9967,ARGUMENT,
9968,ARGUMENT,How curs'd the man whom fate's unhappy doom
9969,ARGUMENT,"Confines, unluckly, to his native home,"
9970,ARGUMENT,"How doubly curs'd by cross grain'd stars is he,"
9971,ARGUMENT,"Whom fate ties down, tho' struggling to be free!"
9972,ARGUMENT,Heaven gave to man this vast extended round.
9973,ARGUMENT,No climes confine him and no oceans bound;
9974,ARGUMENT,"Heaven gave him forest, mountain, vale and plain,"
9975,ARGUMENT,"And bade him vanquish, if he could, the main:"
9976,ARGUMENT,"Then, miser, hoard and heap thy riches still,"
9977,ARGUMENT,"View the sun rise above thy well known hill,"
9978,ARGUMENT,"Vile as the swine, enjoy thy gloomy den,"
9979,ARGUMENT,"Sweat in the compass of a squalid pen,"
9980,ARGUMENT,"'Till sick of life, on terms with death agree,"
9981,ARGUMENT,"And leave thy fortune, not thy heart, to me."
9982,ARGUMENT,"So mus'd the bard who this rough verse indites,"
9983,ARGUMENT,"Asserting freedom, and his country's rights:"
9984,ARGUMENT,Nor mus'd in vain; the fruitful musings brought
9985,ARGUMENT,To practice what in theory he thought;
9986,ARGUMENT,"And gave desire, a keen desire, to roam"
9987,ARGUMENT,A hundred or two hundred leagues from home.
9988,ARGUMENT,"Where should he go? The eastern hills reply,"
9989,ARGUMENT,"Come, pensive traveller, with thy tearful eye,"
9990,ARGUMENT,"Come, and fair Boston from our summit see,"
9991,ARGUMENT,No city sits so widow-like as she;
9992,ARGUMENT,"Her trading navies spread their sails no more,"
9993,ARGUMENT,"Remotest nations cease to seek her shore,"
9994,ARGUMENT,"Deep are her weeds--in darkest sable clad,"
9995,ARGUMENT,"O come and view the Queen of all that's sad,"
9996,ARGUMENT,"Long are her nights, that yield no chearful sound,"
9997,ARGUMENT,"Like endless nights in tombs below the ground,"
9998,ARGUMENT,Low burns her lamp before th' insulting rout;
9999,ARGUMENT,"See, the lamp dies, and every light goes out!"
10000,ARGUMENT,"O Britain come, and, if you can, relent"
10001,ARGUMENT,"This rage, that better might on Spain be spent."
10002,ARGUMENT,Touch'd with the mountain's melancholy prayer
10003,ARGUMENT,(Perhaps a mountain or Dame Fancy there)
10004,ARGUMENT,"Could I refuse, since mutual grief endears,"
10005,ARGUMENT,To seek New Albion's Lady all in tears?
10006,ARGUMENT,"But doubts perplexing hover'd o'er my mind,"
10007,ARGUMENT,Whether to chuse the aid of horse or wind;
10008,ARGUMENT,"That suits the best with bards of place and state,"
10009,ARGUMENT,"This must be needy Rhymers compensate,"
10010,ARGUMENT,"Since Jove his ancient bounty has deny'd,"
10011,ARGUMENT,And grants no modern Pegasus to ride.
10012,ARGUMENT,"Dark was the night, the winds tempestuous roar'd"
10013,ARGUMENT,"From western skies, and warn'd us all aboard;"
10014,ARGUMENT,"Spread were the sails, the nimble vessel flies"
10015,ARGUMENT,O'er Neptune's bosom and reflected skies;
10016,ARGUMENT,Nor halt I here to tell you how she roves
10017,ARGUMENT,O'er Tython's chambers and his coral groves.
10018,ARGUMENT,"Let some prose wand'rer long-sun journals keep,"
10019,ARGUMENT,"I haste me, like the vessel, o'er the deep;"
10020,ARGUMENT,"Nor tire you with descriptions of the coast,"
10021,ARGUMENT,"New mountains gain'd or hills in æther lost,--"
10022,ARGUMENT,"The muse can only hint at scenes like these,"
10023,ARGUMENT,Not stop to spend her poem in their praise:
10024,ARGUMENT,"Three days we cut the brine with steady prore,"
10025,ARGUMENT,The fourth beheld as on New Albion's shore.
10026,ARGUMENT,"Guard me, ye heavens, shield this defenceless head,"
10027,ARGUMENT,While travelling o'er these sanguine plains of dead;
10028,ARGUMENT,"Nor only me, may heaven defend us all"
10029,ARGUMENT,From the harsh rigour of King George's ball.
10030,ARGUMENT,
10031,ARGUMENT,"Far in the depth of an aspiring wood,"
10032,ARGUMENT,"Where roll'd its waves a silver winding flood,"
10033,ARGUMENT,"Our weary vessel urg'd its darksome way,"
10034,ARGUMENT,And safely anchor'd in a shady bay.
10035,ARGUMENT,"Landing, I left the weather-beaten crew,"
10036,ARGUMENT,And pensive rov'd as home-sick travellers do;
10037,ARGUMENT,"When all at once before my wand'ring eyes,"
10038,ARGUMENT,The Genius of the river seem'd to rise;
10039,ARGUMENT,"Tall and erect, untaught by years to bow,"
10040,ARGUMENT,But not a smile relax'd his clouded brow:
10041,ARGUMENT,"His swarthy features vengeful deeds forebode,"
10042,ARGUMENT,Terror march'd on before him as he trode;
10043,ARGUMENT,"His rattling quiver at his shoulder hung,"
10044,ARGUMENT,His pointed spear and glitt'ring helmet rung;
10045,ARGUMENT,"The tall oaks trembled at the warlike shade,"
10046,ARGUMENT,When thus the Genius of the water said:
10047,ARGUMENT,"""O curious stranger, come from far to see"
10048,ARGUMENT,"What grieves us all, but none so much as me!"
10049,ARGUMENT,"The free-born Genius of the woods am I,"
10050,ARGUMENT,Who scorn to dwell in lands of slavery;
10051,ARGUMENT,"I, tho' unseen, command the heart to dare,"
10052,ARGUMENT,"And spread the soul of freedom thro' the air,"
10053,ARGUMENT,"That each may taste and value if he can,"
10054,ARGUMENT,This sovereign good that constitutes the man:
10055,ARGUMENT,"Here, in the center of tyrannic sway,"
10056,ARGUMENT,"I spread my spirit and forbid dismay,"
10057,ARGUMENT,"To every bosom dart may influence round,"
10058,ARGUMENT,Like the sun beams that fructify the ground;
10059,ARGUMENT,But waft a timorous and ignoble breath
10060,ARGUMENT,"Where conscience, conscience bids them shrink at death."
10061,ARGUMENT,"""O stranger, led by Heaven's supreme decree,"
10062,ARGUMENT,"Go, view the dire effects of tyranny,"
10063,ARGUMENT,"Strait to the town direct thy fated way,"
10064,ARGUMENT,"But heark attentive, listen and obey,"
10065,ARGUMENT,"I to thy care commit this magic vest,"
10066,ARGUMENT,"To guard thee 'midst yon' spires, a viewless guest;"
10067,ARGUMENT,"Whene'er its wreathy folds thy limbs embrace,"
10068,ARGUMENT,No mortal eye thy roving step shall trace;
10069,ARGUMENT,"Unseen as ghosts that quit the clay below,"
10070,ARGUMENT,Yet seeing all securely thou shalt go.
10071,ARGUMENT,"There watch the motions of the hostile lines,"
10072,ARGUMENT,"Observe their counsels, watch their deep designs;"
10073,ARGUMENT,"Trace all their schemes, the lawless strength survey"
10074,ARGUMENT,"Of licens'd robbers howling for their prey."""
10075,ARGUMENT,
10076,ARGUMENT,"So spoke the Genius of the shaded wave,"
10077,ARGUMENT,"And then the vest of wondrous virtue gave,"
10078,ARGUMENT,"Which scarce my limbs enwrapt, when I began"
10079,ARGUMENT,To move as ne'er before did mortal man.
10080,ARGUMENT,"Light as the air, as free as winds I stray'd,"
10081,ARGUMENT,"Pierc'd firmest rocks and walls for prisons made,"
10082,ARGUMENT,"Soar'd high, nor ask'd the feeble aid of art,"
10083,ARGUMENT,And trac'd all secrets but the human heart.
10084,ARGUMENT,"Then to the town I held my hasty course,"
10085,ARGUMENT,To Boston's town subdu'd by lawless force;
10086,ARGUMENT,"Close by a centinel I took my stride,"
10087,ARGUMENT,The wretch ne'er saw me tho' I graz'd his side:
10088,ARGUMENT,"But for my vest, what pains had been my lot."
10089,ARGUMENT,"What gibes, what sneers, reproaches, and what not?"
10090,ARGUMENT,Or in their place the robbers had constrained
10091,ARGUMENT,"To turn a Tory, which my heart disdained."
10092,ARGUMENT,
10093,ARGUMENT,"Now stalk'd I on towards the dome of state,"
10094,ARGUMENT,"Where Gage resides, our western Potentate,"
10095,ARGUMENT,"A second Cortez,[a] sent by heaven's command,"
10096,ARGUMENT,"To murder, rage, and ravage o'er our land;"
10097,ARGUMENT,A very Cortez--what's the difference?

11726,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],
11727,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],ADVERTISEMENT--This Poem is founded upon the authority of
11728,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"Scripture, inasmuch as these sacred books assert, that _the last"
11729,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],enemy that shall be conquered is Death_. For the purposes of poetry
11730,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"he is here personified, and represented as on his dying bed. The"
11731,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"scene is laid at a solitary palace, (the time midnight) which, tho'"
11732,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"before beautiful and joyous, is now become sad and gloomy, as being"
11733,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"the abode and receptacle of Death. Its owner, an amiable, majestic"
11734,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"youth, who had lately lost a beloved consort, nevertheless with a"
11735,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"noble philosophical fortitude and humanity, entertains him in a"
11736,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"friendly manner, and by employing Physicians, endeavours to restore"
11737,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"him to health, altho' an enemy; convinced of the excellence and"
11738,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"propriety of that divine precept, _If thine enemy hunger, feed him;"
11739,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"if he thirst, give him drink_. He nevertheless, as if by a spirit"
11740,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"of prophecy, informs this (fictitiously) wicked being of the"
11741,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"certainty of his doom, and represents to him in a pathetic manner"
11742,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"the vanity of his expectations, either of a reception into the"
11743,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"abodes of the just, or continuing longer to make havock of mankind"
11744,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"upon earth. The patient finding his end approaching, composes his"
11745,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"epitaph, and orders it to be engraved on his tombstone, hinting to"
11746,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"us thereby, that even Death and Distress have vanity; and would be"
11747,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"remembered with honour after he is no more, altho' his whole life"
11748,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],has been spent in deeds of devastation and murder. He dies at last
11749,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"in the utmost agonies of despair, after agreeing with an avaricious"
11750,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],Undertaker to intomb his bones. This reflects upon the inhumanity
11751,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"of those men, who, not to mention an enemy, would scarcely cover a"
11752,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"departed friend with a little dust, without certainty of reward for"
11753,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"so doing. The circumstances of his funeral are then recited, and"
11754,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears. It
11755,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],concludes with a few reflections on the impropriety of a too great
11756,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],"attachment to the present life, and incentives to such moral virtue"
11757,THE HOUSE OF NIGHT[156],as may assist in conducting us to a better.

14972,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],As far from land the vessel strays;
14973,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"No longer hill nor dale is seen,"
14974,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"The realms of death intrude between,"
14975,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"But fear no ill; resolve, with me"
14976,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],To share the dangers of the sea.
14977,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
14978,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],But look not there for verdant fields--
14979,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Far different prospects Neptune yields;
14980,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Green seas shall only greet the eye,"
14981,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Those seas encircled by the sky.
14982,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Immense and deep--come then with me
14983,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],And view the wonders of the sea.
14984,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
14985,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Yet sometimes groves and meadows gay
14986,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Delight the seamen on their way;
14987,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],From the deep seas that round us swell
14988,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],With rocks the surges to repel
14989,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Some verdant isle, by waves embrac'd,"
14990,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Swells, to adorn the wat'ry waste."
14991,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
14992,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Though now this vast expanse appear
14993,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"With glassy surface, calm and clear;"
14994,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Be not deceiv'd--'tis but a show,"
14995,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],For many a corpse is laid below--
14996,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Even Britain's lads--it cannot be--
14997,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],They were the masters of the sea!
14998,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
14999,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Now combating upon the brine,"
15000,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Where ships in flaming squadrons join,"
15001,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],At every blast the brave expire
15002,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"'Midst clouds of smoke, and streams of fire;"
15003,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],But scorn all fear; advance with me--
15004,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],'Tis but the custom of the sea.
15005,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
15006,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Now we the peaceful wave divide,"
15007,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"On broken surges now we ride,"
15008,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Now every eye dissolves with woe
15009,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],As on some lee-ward coast we go--
15010,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Half lost, half buried in the main"
15011,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],Hope scarcely beams on life again.
15012,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
15013,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Above us storms distract the sky,"
15014,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Beneath us depths unfathom'd lie,"
15015,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Too near we see, a ghastly sight,[174]"
15016,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"The realms of everlasting night,"
15017,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],A wat'ry tomb of ocean green
15018,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],And only one frail plank between!
15019,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],
15020,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"But winds must cease, and storms decay,"
15021,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Not always lasts the gloomy day,"
15022,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Again the skies are warm and clear,"
15023,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Again soft zephyrs fan the air,"
15024,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Again we find the long lost shore,"
15025,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],The winds oppose our wish no more.

15030,CAPTAIN JONES'S INVITATION[173],"Unmov'd when hostile ships engage,"

15050,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"From a gay island green and fair,"
15051,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"With gentle blasts of southern air,"
15052,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Across the deep we held our way,"
15053,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Around our barque smooth waters played,"
15054,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"No envious clouds obscur'd the day,"
15055,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],Serene came on the evening shade.
15056,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],
15057,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Still farther to the north we drew,"
15058,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"And Porto Rico's mountains blue,"
15059,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Were just decaying on the eye,"
15060,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],When from the main arose the sun;
15061,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Before his ray the shadows fly,"
15062,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],As we before the breezes run.
15063,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],
15064,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Now northward of the tropic pass'd,"
15065,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],The fickle skies grew black at last;
15066,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"The ruffian winds began to roar,"
15067,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"The sea obey'd their tyrant force,"
15068,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"And we, alas! too far from shore,"

15074,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"When a vast billow o'er us broke,"
15075,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"And tore the sheets and tacks away,"
15076,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],Nor could the booms sustain the stroke.
15077,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],
15078,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],Still vaster rose the angry main.
15079,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],The winds through every shroud complain;

15081,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Though doubly reef'd, the furious blast"
15082,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Away the fluttering canvas bore,"
15083,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],And vow'd destruction to the mast.
15084,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],
15085,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"When now the northern storm was quell'd,"

15087,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Beyond the towering mountain's height,"
15088,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],Till from the south new winds arose;
15089,THE SEA VOYAGE[175],"Our sails we spread at dead of night,"
