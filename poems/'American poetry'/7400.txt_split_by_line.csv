495,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
496,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,This was the popular name by which the frigate Constitution
497,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,was known. The poem was first printed in the Boston Daily
498,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Advertiser, at the time when it was proposed to break up the"
499,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,old ship as unfit for service. I subjoin the paragraph which
500,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,led to the writing of the poem. It is from the Advertiser of
501,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Tuesday, September 14, 1830:--"
502,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
503,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"""Old Ironsides.--It has been affirmed upon good authority"
504,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,that the Secretary of the Navy has recommended to the Board of
505,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Navy Commissioners to dispose of the frigate Constitution. Since
506,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,it has been understood that such a step was in contemplation we
507,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"have heard but one opinion expressed, and that in decided"
508,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"disapprobation of the measure. Such a national object of interest,"
509,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"so endeared to our national pride as Old Ironsides is, should"
510,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"never by any act of our government cease to belong to the Navy,"
511,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,so long as our country is to be found upon the map of nations.
512,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,In England it was lately determined by the Admiralty to cut the
513,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Victory, a one-hundred gun ship (which it will be recollected bore"
514,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"the flag of Lord Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar,) down to a"
515,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"seventy-four, but so loud were the lamentations of the people upon"
516,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,the proposed measure that the intention was abandoned. We
517,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,confidently anticipate that the Secretary of the Navy will in like
518,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"manner consult the general wish in regard to the Constitution, and"
519,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,either let her remain in ordinary or rebuild her whenever the
520,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"public service may require.""--New York Journal of Commerce."
521,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
522,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The poem was an impromptu outburst of feeling and was published
523,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,on the next day but one after reading the above paragraph.
524,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
525,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"AY, tear her tattered ensign down"
526,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Long has it waved on high,"
527,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And many an eye has danced to see
528,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,That banner in the sky;
529,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Beneath it rung the battle shout,"
530,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And burst the cannon's roar;--
531,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The meteor of the ocean air
532,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Shall sweep the clouds no more.

538,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"No more shall feel the victor's tread,"
539,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Or know the conquered knee;--

543,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Oh better that her shattered hulk
544,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Should sink beneath the wave;
545,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Her thunders shook the mighty deep,"
546,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And there should be her grave;

548,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Set every threadbare sail,"

557,THE LAST LEAF,
558,THE LAST LEAF,This poem was suggested by the appearance in one of our
559,THE LAST LEAF,"streets of a venerable relic of the Revolution, said to be one"
560,THE LAST LEAF,of the party who threw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor. He
561,THE LAST LEAF,was a fine monumental specimen in his cocked hat and knee
562,THE LAST LEAF,"breeches, with his buckled shoes and his sturdy cane. The smile"
563,THE LAST LEAF,"with which I, as a young man, greeted him, meant no disrespect to"
564,THE LAST LEAF,"an honored fellow-citizen whose costume was out of date, but whose"
565,THE LAST LEAF,patriotism never changed with years. I do not recall any earlier
566,THE LAST LEAF,"example of this form of verse, which was commended by the fastidious"
567,THE LAST LEAF,"Edgar Allan Poe, who made a copy of the whole poem which I have"
568,THE LAST LEAF,in his own handwriting. Good Abraham Lincoln had a great liking
569,THE LAST LEAF,"for the poem, and repeated it from memory to Governor Andrew,"
570,THE LAST LEAF,as the governor himself told me.
571,THE LAST LEAF,
572,THE LAST LEAF,"I SAW him once before,"
573,THE LAST LEAF,"As he passed by the door,"
574,THE LAST LEAF,And again
575,THE LAST LEAF,"The pavement stones resound,"
576,THE LAST LEAF,As he totters o'er the ground
577,THE LAST LEAF,With his cane.
578,THE LAST LEAF,
579,THE LAST LEAF,"They say that in his prime,"
580,THE LAST LEAF,Ere the pruning-knife of Time
581,THE LAST LEAF,"Cut him down,"
582,THE LAST LEAF,Not a better man was found
583,THE LAST LEAF,By the Crier on his round
584,THE LAST LEAF,Through the town.
585,THE LAST LEAF,
586,THE LAST LEAF,"But now he walks the streets,"
587,THE LAST LEAF,And he looks at all he meets
588,THE LAST LEAF,"Sad and wan,"
589,THE LAST LEAF,"And he shakes his feeble head,"
590,THE LAST LEAF,"That it seems as if he said,"
591,THE LAST LEAF,"""They are gone."""
592,THE LAST LEAF,
593,THE LAST LEAF,The mossy marbles rest
594,THE LAST LEAF,On the lips that he has prest
595,THE LAST LEAF,"In their bloom,"
596,THE LAST LEAF,And the names he loved to hear
597,THE LAST LEAF,Have been carved for many a year
598,THE LAST LEAF,On the tomb.
599,THE LAST LEAF,
600,THE LAST LEAF,My grandmamma has said--
601,THE LAST LEAF,"Poor old lady, she is dead"
602,THE LAST LEAF,Long ago--
603,THE LAST LEAF,"That he had a Roman nose,"
604,THE LAST LEAF,And his cheek was like a rose
605,THE LAST LEAF,In the snow.
606,THE LAST LEAF,
607,THE LAST LEAF,"But now his nose is thin,"
608,THE LAST LEAF,And it rests upon his chin
609,THE LAST LEAF,"Like a staff,"
610,THE LAST LEAF,"And a crook is in his back,"
611,THE LAST LEAF,And a melancholy crack
612,THE LAST LEAF,In his laugh.
613,THE LAST LEAF,
614,THE LAST LEAF,I know it is a sin
615,THE LAST LEAF,For me to sit and grin
616,THE LAST LEAF,At him here;
617,THE LAST LEAF,"But the old three-cornered hat,"
618,THE LAST LEAF,"And the breeches, and all that,"
619,THE LAST LEAF,Are so queer!
620,THE LAST LEAF,
621,THE LAST LEAF,And if I should live to be
622,THE LAST LEAF,The last leaf upon the tree
623,THE LAST LEAF,"In the spring,"
624,THE LAST LEAF,"Let them smile, as I do now,"
625,THE LAST LEAF,At the old forsaken bough
626,THE LAST LEAF,Where I cling.

634,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"OUR ancient church! its lowly tower,"
635,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Beneath the loftier spire,"
636,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Is shadowed when the sunset hour
637,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Clothes the tall shaft in fire;
638,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,It sinks beyond the distant eye
639,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Long ere the glittering vane,"
640,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"High wheeling in the western sky,"
641,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Has faded o'er the plain.
642,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
643,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Like Sentinel and Nun, they keep"
644,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Their vigil on the green;
645,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"One seems to guard, and one to weep,"
646,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The dead that lie between;
647,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And both roll out, so full and near,"
648,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Their music's mingling waves,"
649,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"They shake the grass, whose pennoned spear"
650,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Leans on the narrow graves.
651,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
652,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The stranger parts the flaunting weeds,"
653,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Whose seeds the winds have strown
654,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"So thick, beneath the line he reads,"
655,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,They shade the sculptured stone;
656,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The child unveils his clustered brow,"
657,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,And ponders for a while
658,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The graven willow's pendent bough,"
659,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Or rudest cherub's smile.
660,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
661,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"But what to them the dirge, the knell?"
662,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"These were the mourner's share,--"
663,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The sullen clang, whose heavy swell"
664,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Throbbed through the beating air;
665,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The rattling cord, the rolling stone,"
666,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The shelving sand that slid,"
667,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And, far beneath, with hollow tone"
668,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Rung on the coffin's lid.
669,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
670,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The slumberer's mound grows fresh and green,"
671,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Then slowly disappears;
672,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The mosses creep, the gray stones lean,"
673,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Earth hides his date and years;
674,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"But, long before the once-loved name"
675,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Is sunk or worn away,"
676,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No lip the silent dust may claim,"
677,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,That pressed the breathing clay.
678,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
679,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go where the ancient pathway guides,"
680,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,See where our sires laid down
681,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Their smiling babes, their cherished brides,"
682,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The patriarchs of the town;
683,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Hast thou a tear for buried love?
684,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,A sigh for transient power?
685,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"All that a century left above,"
686,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go, read it in an hour!"
687,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
688,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The Indian's shaft, the Briton's ball,"
689,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The sabre's thirsting edge,"
690,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The hot shell, shattering in its fall,"
691,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The bayonet's rending wedge,--"
692,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Here scattered death; yet, seek the spot,"
693,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No trace thine eye can see,"
694,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No altar,--and they need it not"
695,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Who leave their children free!
696,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
697,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Look where the turbid rain-drops stand
698,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,In many a chiselled square;
699,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The knightly crest, the shield, the brand"
700,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Of honored names were there;--
701,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Alas! for every tear is dried
702,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Those blazoned tablets knew,"
703,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Save when the icy marble's side
704,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Drips with the evening dew.
705,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
706,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Or gaze upon yon pillared stone,"
707,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The empty urn of pride;
708,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"There stand the Goblet and the Sun,--"
709,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,What need of more beside?
710,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Where lives the memory of the dead,"
711,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Who made their tomb a toy?
712,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Whose ashes press that nameless bed?
713,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go, ask the village boy!"
714,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
715,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Lean o'er the slender western wall,"
716,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Ye ever-roaming girls;
717,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The breath that bids the blossom fall
718,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"May lift your floating curls,"
719,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,To sweep the simple lines that tell
720,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,An exile's date and doom;
721,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And sigh, for where his daughters dwell,"
722,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,They wreathe the stranger's tomb.
723,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
724,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And one amid these shades was born,"
725,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Beneath this turf who lies,"
726,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Once beaming as the summer's morn,"
727,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,That closed her gentle eyes;
728,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"If sinless angels love as we,"
729,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Who stood thy grave beside,"
730,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Three seraph welcomes waited thee,"
731,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The daughter, sister, bride."
732,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
733,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,I wandered to thy buried mound
734,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,When earth was hid below
735,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The level of the glaring ground,"
736,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Choked to its gates with snow,"
737,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,And when with summer's flowery waves
738,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The lake of verdure rolled,"
739,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,As if a Sultan's white-robed slaves
740,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Had scattered pearls and gold.
741,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
742,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Nay, the soft pinions of the air,"
743,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"That lift this trembling tone,"
744,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Its breath of love may almost bear
745,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,To kiss thy funeral stone;
746,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And, now thy smiles have passed away,"
747,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"For all the joy they gave,"
748,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,May sweetest dews and warmest ray
749,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Lie on thine early grave!
750,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
751,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,When damps beneath and storms above
752,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Have bowed these fragile towers,"
753,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Still o'er the graves yon locust grove
754,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Shall swing its Orient flowers;
755,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And I would ask no mouldering bust,"
756,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"If e'er this humble line,"
757,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Which breathed a sigh o'er other's dust,"

842,THE DILEMMA,I had a vision in my dreams;--
843,THE DILEMMA,I saw a row of twenty beams;
844,THE DILEMMA,"From every beam a rope was hung,"
845,THE DILEMMA,In every rope a lover swung;
846,THE DILEMMA,I asked the hue of every eye
847,THE DILEMMA,That bade each luckless lover die;
848,THE DILEMMA,"Ten shadowy lips said, heavenly blue,"
849,THE DILEMMA,And ten accused the darker hue.
850,THE DILEMMA,
851,THE DILEMMA,I asked a matron which she deemed

854,THE DILEMMA,Give her blue eyes and golden hair.
855,THE DILEMMA,"I might have liked her judgment well,"
856,THE DILEMMA,"But, as she spoke, she rung the bell,"
857,THE DILEMMA,"And all her girls, nor small nor few,"
858,THE DILEMMA,"Came marching in,--their eyes were blue."
859,THE DILEMMA,
860,THE DILEMMA,I asked a maiden; back she flung
861,THE DILEMMA,"The locks that round her forehead hung,"
862,THE DILEMMA,"And turned her eye, a glorious one,"
863,THE DILEMMA,"Bright as a diamond in the sun,"
864,THE DILEMMA,"On me, until beneath its rays"
865,THE DILEMMA,I felt as if my hair would blaze;
866,THE DILEMMA,She liked all eyes but eyes of green;
867,THE DILEMMA,She looked at me; what could she mean?
868,THE DILEMMA,
869,THE DILEMMA,"Ah! many lids Love lurks between,"
870,THE DILEMMA,Nor heeds the coloring of his screen;

872,THE DILEMMA,"The victim falls, but knows not why."
873,THE DILEMMA,"Gaze not upon his shield of jet,"
874,THE DILEMMA,The shaft upon the string is set;
875,THE DILEMMA,"Look not beneath his azure veil,"
876,THE DILEMMA,Though every limb were cased in mail.

879,THE DILEMMA,The chain that bound him to the stake;
880,THE DILEMMA,"And both, with but a single ray,"
881,THE DILEMMA,Can melt our very hearts away;
882,THE DILEMMA,"And both, when balanced, hardly seem"

1195,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I wonder how you came to be
1196,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,In such a stylish frame;
1197,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Perhaps you were a favorite child,"
1198,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Perhaps an only one;
1199,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Perhaps your friends were not aware
1200,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,You had your portrait done.
1201,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,
1202,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Yet you must be a harmless soul;
1203,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I cannot think that Sin
1204,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Would care to throw his loaded dice,"
1205,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,With such a stake to win;
1206,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I cannot think you would provoke
1207,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"The poet's wicked pen,"
1208,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Or make young women bite their lips,"
1209,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Or ruin fine young men.
1210,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,
1211,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Pray, did you ever hear, my love,"
1212,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Of boys that go about,"
1213,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Who, for a very trifling sum,"
1214,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Will snip one's picture out?
1215,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"I'm not averse to red and white,"
1216,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"But all things have their place,"
1217,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I think a profile cut in black
1218,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Would suit your style of face!
1219,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,
1220,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I love sweet features; I will own
1221,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,That I should like myself
1222,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"To see my portrait on a wall,"
1223,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Or bust upon a shelf;
1224,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,But nature sometimes makes one up
1225,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Of such sad odds and ends,"
1226,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,It really might be quite as well
1227,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Hushed up among one's friends!
1228,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,

1233,THE COMET,THE COMET
1234,THE COMET,
1235,THE COMET,"THE Comet! He is on his way,"
1236,THE COMET,And singing as he flies;
1237,THE COMET,The whizzing planets shrink before
1238,THE COMET,The spectre of the skies;
1239,THE COMET,"Ah! well may regal orbs burn blue,"
1240,THE COMET,"And satellites turn pale,"
1241,THE COMET,"Ten million cubic miles of head,"
1242,THE COMET,Ten billion leagues of tail!
1243,THE COMET,
1244,THE COMET,"On, on by whistling spheres of light"
1245,THE COMET,He flashes and he flames;
1246,THE COMET,"He turns not to the left nor right,"
1247,THE COMET,He asks them not their names;
1248,THE COMET,"One spurn from his demoniac heel,--"
1249,THE COMET,"Away, away they fly,"
1250,THE COMET,Where darkness might be bottled up
1251,THE COMET,"And sold for ""Tyrian dye."""
1252,THE COMET,
1253,THE COMET,"And what would happen to the land,"
1254,THE COMET,"And how would look the sea,"
1255,THE COMET,If in the bearded devil's path
1256,THE COMET,Our earth should chance to be?
1257,THE COMET,"Full hot and high the sea would boil,"
1258,THE COMET,Full red the forests gleam;
1259,THE COMET,Methought I saw and heard it all
1260,THE COMET,In a dyspeptic dream!
1261,THE COMET,
1262,THE COMET,I saw a tutor take his tube
1263,THE COMET,The Comet's course to spy;
1264,THE COMET,"I heard a scream,--the gathered rays"
1265,THE COMET,Had stewed the tutor's eye;
1266,THE COMET,"I saw a fort,--the soldiers all"
1267,THE COMET,Were armed with goggles green;
1268,THE COMET,Pop cracked the guns! whiz flew the balls!
1269,THE COMET,Bang went the magazine!
1270,THE COMET,
1271,THE COMET,I saw a poet dip a scroll
1272,THE COMET,"Each moment in a tub,"
1273,THE COMET,"I read upon the warping back,"
1274,THE COMET,"""The Dream of Beelzebub;"""
1275,THE COMET,"He could not see his verses burn,"
1276,THE COMET,"Although his brain was fried,"
1277,THE COMET,And ever and anon he bent
1278,THE COMET,To wet them as they dried.
1279,THE COMET,
1280,THE COMET,I saw the scalding pitch roll down
1281,THE COMET,"The crackling, sweating pines,"
1282,THE COMET,"And streams of smoke, like water-spouts,"
1283,THE COMET,Burst through the rumbling mines;
1284,THE COMET,I asked the firemen why they made
1285,THE COMET,Such noise about the town;
1286,THE COMET,"They answered not,--but all the while"
1287,THE COMET,The brakes went up and down.
1288,THE COMET,
1289,THE COMET,I saw a roasting pullet sit
1290,THE COMET,Upon a baking egg;
1291,THE COMET,I saw a cripple scorch his hand
1292,THE COMET,Extinguishing his leg;
1293,THE COMET,I saw nine geese upon the wing
1294,THE COMET,"Towards the frozen pole,"
1295,THE COMET,And every mother's gosling fell
1296,THE COMET,Crisped to a crackling coal.
1297,THE COMET,
1298,THE COMET,I saw the ox that browsed the grass
1299,THE COMET,"Writhe in the blistering rays,"
1300,THE COMET,The herbage in his shrinking jaws
1301,THE COMET,Was all a fiery blaze;
1302,THE COMET,"I saw huge fishes, boiled to rags,"
1303,THE COMET,Bob through the bubbling brine;
1304,THE COMET,And thoughts of supper crossed my soul;
1305,THE COMET,I had been rash at mine.
1306,THE COMET,
1307,THE COMET,Strange sights! strange sounds! Oh fearful dream!
1308,THE COMET,"Its memory haunts me still,"
1309,THE COMET,"The steaming sea, the crimson glare,"
1310,THE COMET,That wreathed each wooded hill;
1311,THE COMET,Stranger! if through thy reeling brain
1312,THE COMET,"Such midnight visions sweep,"
1313,THE COMET,"Spare, spare, oh, spare thine evening meal,"
1314,THE COMET,And sweet shall be thy sleep!

1321,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1322,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,THERE are three ways in which men take
1323,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"One's money from his purse,"
1324,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And very hard it is to tell
1325,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Which of the three is worse;
1326,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,But all of them are bad enough
1327,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To make a body curse.
1328,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1329,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You're riding out some pleasant day,"
1330,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And counting up your gains;
1331,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"A fellow jumps from out a bush,"
1332,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And takes your horse's reins,"
1333,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Another hints some words about
1334,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A bullet in your brains.
1335,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1336,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,It's hard to meet such pressing friends
1337,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,In such a lonely spot;
1338,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"It's very hard to lose your cash,"
1339,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,But harder to be shot;
1340,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And so you take your wallet out,"
1341,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Though you would rather not.
1342,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1343,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Perhaps you're going out to dine,--"
1344,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Some odious creature begs
1345,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,You'll hear about the cannon-ball
1346,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"That carried off his pegs,"
1347,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And says it is a dreadful thing
1348,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,For men to lose their legs.
1349,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1350,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"He tells you of his starving wife,"
1351,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"His children to be fed,"
1352,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Poor little, lovely innocents,"
1353,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"All clamorous for bread,--"
1354,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And so you kindly help to put
1355,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A bachelor to bed.
1356,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1357,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You're sitting on your window-seat,"
1358,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Beneath a cloudless moon;
1359,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You hear a sound, that seems to wear"
1360,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"The semblance of a tune,"
1361,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,As if a broken fife should strive
1362,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To drown a cracked bassoon.
1363,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1364,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And nearer, nearer still, the tide"
1365,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Of music seems to come,"
1366,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"There's something like a human voice,"
1367,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And something like a drum;
1368,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You sit in speechless agony,"
1369,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Until your ear is numb.
1370,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1371,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Poor ""home, sweet home"" should seem to be"
1372,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A very dismal place;
1373,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Your ""auld acquaintance"" all at once"
1374,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Is altered in the face;
1375,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Their discords sting through Burns and Moore,"
1376,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Like hedgehogs dressed in lace.
1377,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1378,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You think they are crusaders, sent"
1379,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"From some infernal clime,"
1380,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"To pluck the eyes of Sentiment,"
1381,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And dock the tail of Rhyme,"
1382,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"To crack the voice of Melody,"
1383,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And break the legs of Time.
1384,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1385,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"But hark! the air again is still,"
1386,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"The music all is ground,"
1387,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And silence, like a poultice, comes"
1388,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To heal the blows of sound;
1389,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"It cannot be,--it is,--it is,--"
1390,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A hat is going round!
1391,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1392,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,No! Pay the dentist when he leaves
1393,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"A fracture in your jaw,"
1394,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And pay the owner of the bear
1395,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"That stunned you with his paw,"
1396,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And buy the lobster that has had
1397,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Your knuckles in his claw;
1398,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1399,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"But if you are a portly man,"
1400,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Put on your fiercest frown,"
1401,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And talk about a constable
1402,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To turn them out of town;
1403,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Then close your sentence with an oath,"
1404,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And shut the window down!
1405,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1406,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And if you are a slender man,"
1407,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Not big enough for that,"
1408,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Or, if you cannot make a speech,"
1409,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Because you are a flat,"
1410,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Go very quietly and drop

1423,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Then tread away, my gallant boys,"
1424,THE TREADMILL SONG,And make the axle fly;

1427,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1428,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Wake up, wake up, my duck-legged man,"
1429,THE TREADMILL SONG,And stir your solid pegs
1430,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Arouse, arouse, my gawky friend,"
1431,THE TREADMILL SONG,And shake your spider legs;
1432,THE TREADMILL SONG,"What though you're awkward at the trade,"
1433,THE TREADMILL SONG,"There's time enough to learn,--"
1434,THE TREADMILL SONG,"So lean upon the rail, my lad,"

1436,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1437,THE TREADMILL SONG,"They've built us up a noble wall,"
1438,THE TREADMILL SONG,To keep the vulgar out;
1439,THE TREADMILL SONG,We've nothing in the world to do
1440,THE TREADMILL SONG,But just to walk about;
1441,THE TREADMILL SONG,"So faster, now, you middle men,"
1442,THE TREADMILL SONG,"And try to beat the ends,--"
1443,THE TREADMILL SONG,It's pleasant work to ramble round

1445,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1446,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Here, tread upon the long man's toes,"

1450,THE TREADMILL SONG,"He's lost them both,--don't pull his hair,"
1451,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Because he wears a scratch,"
1452,THE TREADMILL SONG,"But poke him in the further eye,"
1453,THE TREADMILL SONG,That is n't in the patch.
1454,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1455,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Hark! fellows, there 's the supper-bell,"
1456,THE TREADMILL SONG,And so our work is done;

1470,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"This tremendous hurricane occurred on the 23d of September,  1815."
1471,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I remember it well, being then seven years old. A full account of"
1472,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"it was published, I think, in the records of the American Academy"
1473,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,of Arts and Sciences. Some of my recollections are given in The
1474,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Seasons, an article to be found in a book of mine entitled Pages"
1475,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,from an Old Volume of Life.
1476,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1477,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I'M not a chicken; I have seen
1478,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Full many a chill September,"
1479,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And though I was a youngster then,"
1480,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,That gale I well remember;
1481,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The day before, my kite-string snapped,"
1482,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And I, my kite pursuing,"
1483,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The wind whisked off my palm-leaf hat;
1484,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,For me two storms were brewing!
1485,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1486,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"It came as quarrels sometimes do,"
1487,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,When married folks get clashing;
1488,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"There was a heavy sigh or two,"
1489,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Before the fire was flashing,--"
1490,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A little stir among the clouds,"
1491,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Before they rent asunder,--"
1492,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A little rocking of the trees,"
1493,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And then came on the thunder.
1494,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1495,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Lord! how the ponds and rivers boiled!
1496,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,They seemed like bursting craters!
1497,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And oaks lay scattered on the ground
1498,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,As if they were p'taters;
1499,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And all above was in a howl,"
1500,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And all below a clatter,--"
1501,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The earth was like a frying-pan,"
1502,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Or some such hissing matter.
1503,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1504,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"It chanced to be our washing-day,"
1505,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And all our things were drying;
1506,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The storm came roaring through the lines,"
1507,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And set them all a flying;
1508,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I saw the shirts and petticoats
1509,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Go riding off like witches;
1510,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I lost, ah! bitterly I wept,--"
1511,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I lost my Sunday breeches!
1512,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1513,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I saw them straddling through the air,"
1514,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Alas! too late to win them;
1515,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I saw them chase the clouds, as if"
1516,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The devil had been in them;

1521,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1522,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"That night I saw them in my dreams,"
1523,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,How changed from what I knew them!
1524,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The dews had steeped their faded threads,"
1525,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The winds had whistled through them
1526,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I saw the wide and ghastly rents
1527,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Where demon claws had torn them;
1528,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A hole was in their amplest part,"
1529,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,As if an imp had worn them.

1531,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I have had many happy years,"

1575,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,
1576,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,The fourth; he broke into a roar;
1577,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,The fifth; his waistband split;

1579,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,And tumbled in a fit.

1659,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1660,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,This Academic Poem presents the simple and partial views of a young
1661,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,person trained after the schools of classical English verse as
1662,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"represented by Pope, Goldsmith, and Campbell, with whose lines his"
1663,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,memory was early stocked. It will be observed that it deals chiefly with
1664,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,the constructive side of the poet's function. That which makes him a
1665,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"poet is not the power of writing melodious rhymes, it is not the"
1666,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,possession of ordinary human sensibilities nor even of both these
1667,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"qualities in connection with each other. I should rather say, if I were"
1668,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"now called upon to define it, it is the power of transfiguring the"
1669,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from his
1670,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,imagination and kindles that of others. Emotion is its stimulus and
1671,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"language furnishes its expression; but these are not all, as some might"
1672,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,infer was the doctrine of the poem before the reader.
1673,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1674,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,A common mistake made by young persons who suppose themselves to have
1675,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,the poetical gift is that their own spiritual exaltation finds a true
1676,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,expression in the conventional phrases which are borrowed from the
1677,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,voices of the singers whose inspiration they think they share.
1678,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1679,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Looking at this poem as an expression of some aspects of the _ars
1680,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"poetica_, with some passages which I can read even at this mature period"
1681,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"of life without blushing for them, it may stand as the most serious"
1682,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,representation of my early efforts. Intended as it was for public
1683,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"delivery, many of its paragraphs may betray the fact by their somewhat"
1684,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,rhetorical and sonorous character.
1685,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1686,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,SCENES of my youth! awake its slumbering fire!
1687,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ye winds of Memory, sweep the silent lyre!"
1688,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ray of the past, if yet thou canst appear,"
1689,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Break through the clouds of Fancy's waning year;
1690,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Chase from her breast the thin autumnal snow,"
1691,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If leaf or blossom still is fresh below!
1692,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1693,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Long have I wandered; the returning tide
1694,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Brought back an exile to his cradle's side;
1695,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And as my bark her time-worn flag unrolled,"
1696,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To greet the land-breeze with its faded fold,"
1697,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So, in remembrance of my boyhood's time,"
1698,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,I lift these ensigns of neglected rhyme;
1699,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Oh, more than blest, that, all my wanderings through,"
1700,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,My anchor falls where first my pennons flew!
1701,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1702,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,. . . . . . . . .
1703,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1704,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The morning light, which rains its quivering beams"
1705,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Wide o'er the plains, the summits, and the streams,"
1706,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,In one broad blaze expands its golden glow
1707,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,On all that answers to its glance below;
1708,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Yet, changed on earth, each far reflected ray"
1709,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Braids with fresh hues the shining brow of day;
1710,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Now, clothed in blushes by the painted flowers,"
1711,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Tracks on their cheeks the rosy-fingered hours;
1712,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Now, lost in shades, whose dark entangled leaves"
1713,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Drip at the noontide from their pendent eaves,"
1714,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Fades into gloom, or gleams in light again"
1715,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,From every dew-drop on the jewelled plain.
1716,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1717,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1718,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"We, like the leaf, the summit, or the wave,"
1719,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Reflect the light our common nature gave,"
1720,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"But every sunbeam, falling from her throne,"
1721,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Wears on our hearts some coloring of our own
1722,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Chilled in the slave, and burning in the free,"
1723,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea;
1724,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Lost, like the lightning in the sullen clod,"
1725,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Or shedding radiance, like the smiles of God;"
1726,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Pure, pale in Virtue, as the star above,"
1727,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Or quivering roseate on the leaves of Love;
1728,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Glaring like noontide, where it glows upon"
1729,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ambition's sands,--the desert in the sun,--"
1730,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene
1731,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Life's common coloring,--intellectual green."
1732,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1733,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Thus Heaven, repeating its material plan,"
1734,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Arched over all the rainbow mind of man;
1735,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"But he who, blind to universal laws,"
1736,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sees but effects, unconscious of their cause,--"
1737,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Believes each image in itself is bright,"
1738,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Not robed in drapery of reflected light,--"
1739,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Is like the rustic who, amidst his toil,"
1740,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Has found some crystal in his meagre soil,"
1741,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, lost in rapture, thinks for him alone"
1742,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Earth worked her wonders on the sparkling stone,"
1743,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Nor dreams that Nature, with as nice a line,"
1744,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Carved countless angles through the boundless mine.
1745,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1746,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Thus err the many, who, entranced to find"
1747,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Unwonted lustre in some clearer mind,"
1748,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Believe that Genius sets the laws at naught
1749,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Which chain the pinions of our wildest thought;
1750,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Untaught to measure, with the eye of art,"
1751,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The wandering fancy or the wayward heart;
1752,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Who match the little only with the less,"
1753,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And gaze in rapture at its slight excess,"
1754,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Proud of a pebble, as the brightest gem"
1755,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Whose light might crown an emperor's diadem.
1756,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1757,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, most of all, the pure ethereal fire"
1758,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Which seems to radiate from the poet's lyre
1759,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Is to the world a mystery and a charm,"
1760,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"An AEgis wielded on a mortal's arm,"
1761,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While Reason turns her dazzled eye away,"
1762,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And bows her sceptre to her subject's sway;
1763,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And thus the poet, clothed with godlike state,"
1764,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Usurped his Maker's title--to create;
1765,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"He, whose thoughts differing not in shape, but dress,"
1766,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"What others feel more fitly can express,"
1767,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne,"
1768,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Peeps through the bars, and calls the world his own."
1769,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1770,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,There breathes no being but has some pretence
1771,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,To that fine instinct called poetic sense
1772,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The rudest savage, roaming through the wild;"
1773,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The simplest rustic, bending o'er his child;"
1774,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The infant, listening to the warbling bird;"
1775,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The mother, smiling at its half-formed word;"
1776,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The boy uncaged, who tracks the fields at large;"
1777,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The girl, turned matron to her babe-like charge;"
1778,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The freeman, casting with unpurchased hand"
1779,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The vote that shakes the turret of the land;
1780,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The slave, who, slumbering on his rusted chain,"
1781,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Dreams of the palm-trees on his burning plain;
1782,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The hot-cheeked reveller, tossing down the wine,"
1783,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To join the chorus pealing ""Auld lang syne"";"
1784,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The gentle maid, whose azure eye grows dim,"
1785,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,While Heaven is listening to her evening hymn;
1786,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The jewelled beauty, when her steps draw near"
1787,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The circling dance and dazzling chandelier;
1788,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"E'en trembling age, when Spring's renewing air"
1789,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Waves the thin ringlets of his silvered hair;--
1790,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"All, all are glowing with the inward flame,"
1791,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Whose wider halo wreathes the poet's name,"
1792,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While, unenbalmed, the silent dreamer dies,"
1793,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,His memory passing with his smiles and sighs!
1794,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1795,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If glorious visions, born for all mankind,"
1796,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The bright auroras of our twilight mind;
1797,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If fancies, varying as the shapes that lie"
1798,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Stained on the windows of the sunset sky;
1799,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If hopes, that beckon with delusive gleams,"
1800,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Till the eye dances in the void of dreams;
1801,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If passions, following with the winds that urge"
1802,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Earth's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge;--
1803,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If these on all some transient hours bestow
1804,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Of rapture tingling with its hectic glow,"
1805,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Then all are poets; and if earth had rolled
1806,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Her myriad centuries, and her doom were told,"
1807,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Each moaning billow of her shoreless wave
1808,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Would wail its requiem o'er a poet's grave!
1809,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1810,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If to embody in a breathing word
1811,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Tones that the spirit trembled when it heard;
1812,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To fix the image all unveiled and warm,"
1813,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And carve in language its ethereal form,"
1814,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So pure, so perfect, that the lines express"
1815,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"No meagre shrinking, no unlaced excess;"
1816,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To feel that art, in living truth, has taught"
1817,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ourselves, reflected in the sculptured thought;--"
1818,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If this alone bestow the right to claim
1819,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The deathless garland and the sacred name,"
1820,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Then none are poets save the saints on high,"
1821,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Whose harps can murmur all that words deny!
1822,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1823,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,But though to none is granted to reveal
1824,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In perfect semblance all that each may feel,"
1825,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As withered flowers recall forgotten love,"
1826,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So, warmed to life, our faded passions move"
1827,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In every line, where kindling fancy throws"
1828,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The gleam of pleasures or the shade of woes.
1829,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1830,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"When, schooled by time, the stately queen of art"
1831,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Had smoothed the pathways leading to the heart,"
1832,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Assumed her measured tread, her solemn tone,"
1833,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And round her courts the clouds of fable thrown,"
1834,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The wreaths of heaven descended on her shrine,"
1835,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And wondering earth proclaimed the Muse divine.
1836,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Yet if her votaries had but dared profane
1837,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The mystic symbols of her sacred reign,"
1838,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,How had they smiled beneath the veil to find
1839,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,What slender threads can chain the mighty mind!
1840,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1841,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1842,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Poets, like painters, their machinery claim,"
1843,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And verse bestows the varnish and the frame;
1844,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Our grating English, whose Teutonic jar"
1845,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Shakes the racked axle of Art's rattling car,"
1846,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Fits like mosaic in the lines that gird
1847,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Fast in its place each many-angled word;
1848,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"From Saxon lips Anacreon's numbers glide,"
1849,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As once they melted on the Teian tide,"
1850,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, fresh transfused, the Iliad thrills again"
1851,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,From Albion's cliffs as o'er Achaia's plain
1852,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The proud heroic, with, its pulse-like beat,"
1853,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Rings like the cymbals clashing as they meet;
1854,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The sweet Spenserian, gathering as it flows,"
1855,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sweeps gently onward to its dying close,"
1856,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Where waves on waves in long succession pour,"
1857,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Till the ninth billow melts along the shore;
1858,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The lonely spirit of the mournful lay,"
1859,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Which lives immortal as the verse of Gray,"
1860,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In sable plumage slowly drifts along,"
1861,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"On eagle pinion, through the air of song;"
1862,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The glittering lyric bounds elastic by,"
1863,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"With flashing ringlets and exulting eye,"
1864,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While every image, in her airy whirl,"
1865,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Gleams like a diamond on a dancing girl!
1866,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1867,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Born with mankind, with man's expanded range"
1868,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And varying fates the poet's numbers change;
1869,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Thus in his history may we hope to find
1870,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Some clearer epochs of the poet's mind,"
1871,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As from the cradle of its birth we trace,"
1872,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Slow wandering forth, the patriarchal race."

1879,I.,Wears on her breast the varnished buds of Spring;
1880,I.,"When the loosed current, as its folds uncoil,"
1881,I.,Slides in the channels of the mellowed soil;
1882,I.,When the young hyacinth returns to seek
1883,I.,The air and sunshine with her emerald beak;
1884,I.,"When the light snowdrops, starting from their cells,"
1885,I.,Hang each pagoda with its silver bells;
1886,I.,When the frail willow twines her trailing bow
1887,I.,With pallid leaves that sweep the soil below;
1888,I.,"When the broad elm, sole empress of the plain,"
1889,I.,"Whose circling shadow speaks a century's reign,"
1890,I.,"Wreathes in the clouds her regal diadem,--"
1891,I.,A forest waving on a single stem;--

1896,I.,"Nay, in thyself, whate'er may be thy fate,"
1897,I.,"Pallid with toil or surfeited with state,"
1898,I.,"Mark how thy fancies, with the vernal rose,"
1899,I.,"Awake, all sweetness, from their long repose;"
1900,I.,"Then turn to ponder o'er the classic page,"
1901,I.,"Traced with the idyls of a greener age,"
1902,I.,And learn the instinct which arose to warm
1903,I.,Art's earliest essay and her simplest form.
1904,I.,
1905,I.,To themes like these her narrow path confined
1906,I.,The first-born impulse moving in the mind;
1907,I.,"In vales unshaken by the trumpet's sound,"
1908,I.,"Where peaceful Labor tills his fertile ground,"
1909,I.,"The silent changes of the rolling years,"
1910,I.,"Marked on the soil or dialled on the spheres,"
1911,I.,"The crested forests and the colored flowers,"
1912,I.,"The dewy grottos and the blushing bowers,--"
1913,I.,"These, and their guardians, who, with liquid names,"
1914,I.,"Strephons and Chloes, melt in mutual flames,"
1915,I.,"Woo the young Muses from their mountain shade,"
1916,I.,To make Arcadias in the lonely glade.
1917,I.,
1918,I.,Nor think they visit only with their smiles
1919,I.,The fabled valleys and Elysian isles;
1920,I.,He who is wearied of his village plain
1921,I.,May roam the Edens of the world in vain.
1922,I.,"'T is not the star-crowned cliff, the cataract's flow,"
1923,I.,"The softer foliage or the greener glow,"
1924,I.,"The lake of sapphire or the spar-hung cave,"
1925,I.,"The brighter sunset or the broader wave,"
1926,I.,Can warm his heart whom every wind has blown
1927,I.,"To every shore, forgetful of his own."
1928,I.,
1929,I.,Home of our childhood! how affection clings
1930,I.,And hovers round thee with her seraph wings!
1931,I.,"Dearer thy hills, though clad in autumn brown,"
1932,I.,Than fairest summits which the cedars crown!
1933,I.,Sweeter the fragrance of thy summer breeze
1934,I.,Than all Arabia breathes along the seas!
1935,I.,"The stranger's gale wafts home the exile's sigh,"
1936,I.,For the heart's temple is its own blue sky!
1937,I.,
1938,I.,"Oh happiest they, whose early love unchanged,"
1939,I.,"Hopes undissolved, and friendship unestranged,"
1940,I.,"Tired of their wanderings, still can deign to see"
1941,I.,"Love, hopes, and friendship, centring all in thee!"
1942,I.,
1943,I.,"And thou, my village! as again I tread"
1944,I.,Amidst thy living and above thy dead;
1945,I.,Though some fair playmates guard with charter  fears
1946,I.,"Their cheeks, grown holy with the lapse of years;"
1947,I.,"Though with the dust some reverend locks may  blend,"
1948,I.,Where life's last mile-stone marks the journey's end;
1949,I.,"On every bud the changing year recalls,"
1950,I.,"The brightening glance of morning memory falls,"
1951,I.,Still following onward as the months unclose
1952,I.,The balmy lilac or the bridal rose;
1953,I.,"And still shall follow, till they sink once more"
1954,I.,"Beneath the snow-drifts of the frozen shore,"
1955,I.,"As when my bark, long tossing in the gale,"
1956,I.,Furled in her port her tempest-rended sail!
1957,I.,
1958,I.,"What shall I give thee? Can a simple lay,"
1959,I.,"Flung on thy bosom like a girl's bouquet,"
1960,I.,"Do more than deck thee for an idle hour,"
1961,I.,"Then fall unheeded, fading like the flower?"
1962,I.,"Yet, when I trod, with footsteps wild and free,"
1963,I.,"The crackling leaves beneath yon linden-tree,"
1964,I.,"Panting from play or dripping from the stream,"
1965,I.,How bright the visions of my boyish dream
1966,I.,"Or, modest Charles, along thy broken edge,"
1967,I.,"Black with soft ooze and fringed with arrowy sedge,"
1968,I.,"As once I wandered in the morning sun,"
1969,I.,"With reeking sandal and superfluous gun,"
1970,I.,"How oft, as Fancy whispered in the gale,"
1971,I.,Thou wast the Avon of her flattering tale!
1972,I.,"Ye hills, whose foliage, fretted on the skies,"
1973,I.,"Prints shadowy arches on their evening dyes,"
1974,I.,How should my song with holiest charm invest
1975,I.,Each dark ravine and forest-lifting crest!
1976,I.,"How clothe in beauty each familiar scene,"
1977,I.,Till all was classic on my native green!
1978,I.,
1979,I.,"As the drained fountain, filled with autumn leaves,"
1980,I.,"The field swept naked of its garnered sheaves,"
1981,I.,"So wastes at noon the promise of our dawn,"
1982,I.,"The springs all choking, and the harvest gone."
1983,I.,
1984,I.,Yet hear the lay of one whose natal star
1985,I.,Still seemed the brightest when it shone afar;
1986,I.,"Whose cheek, grown pallid with ungracious toil,"
1987,I.,Glows in the welcome of his parent soil;
1988,I.,"And ask no garlands sought beyond the tide,"
1989,I.,But take the leaflets gathered at your side.
1990,I.,
1991,I.,
1992,I.,
1993,II.,II.
1994,II.,
1995,II.,"But times were changed; the torch of terror came,"
1996,II.,To light the summits with the beacon's flame;
1997,II.,"The streams ran crimson, the tall mountain pines"
1998,II.,Rose a new forest o'er embattled lines;
1999,II.,"The bloodless sickle lent the warrior's steel,"
2000,II.,The harvest bowed beneath his chariot wheel;
2001,II.,Where late the wood-dove sheltered her repose
2002,II.,The raven waited for the conflict's close;
2003,II.,The cuirassed sentry walked his sleepless round
2004,II.,Where Daphne smiled or Amaryllis frowned;
2005,II.,"Where timid minstrels sung their blushing charms,"
2006,II.,"Some wild Tyrtaeus called aloud, ""To arms!"""
2007,II.,
2008,II.,"When Glory wakes, when fiery spirits leap,"
2009,II.,"Roused by her accents from their tranquil sleep,"
2010,II.,The ray that flashes from the soldier's crest
2011,II.,"Lights, as it glances, in the poet's breast;--"
2012,II.,"Not in pale dreamers, whose fantastic lay"
2013,II.,"Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play,"
2014,II.,"But men, who act the passions they inspire,"
2015,II.,Who wave the sabre as they sweep the lyre!
2016,II.,
2017,II.,"Ye mild enthusiasts, whose pacific frowns"
2018,II.,"Are lost like dew-drops caught in burning towns,"
2019,II.,"Pluck as ye will the radiant plumes of fame,"
2020,II.,Break Caesar's bust to make yourselves a name;
2021,II.,But if your country bares the avenger's blade
2022,II.,"For wrongs unpunished or for debts unpaid,"
2023,II.,"When the roused nation bids her armies form,"
2024,II.,"And screams her eagle through the gathering storm,"
2025,II.,"When from your ports the bannered frigate rides,"
2026,II.,"Her black bows scowling to the crested tides,"
2027,II.,Your hour has past; in vain your feeble cry
2028,II.,As the babe's wailings to the thundering sky!
2029,II.,
2030,II.,Scourge of mankind! with all the dread array
2031,II.,"That wraps in wrath thy desolating way,"
2032,II.,"As the wild tempest wakes the slumbering sea,"
2033,II.,Thou only teachest all that man can be.
2034,II.,Alike thy tocsin has the power to charm
2035,II.,"The toil-knit sinews of the rustic's arm,"
2036,II.,"Or swell the pulses in the poet's veins,"
2037,II.,And bid the nations tremble at his strains.
2038,II.,
2039,II.,"The city slept beneath the moonbeam's glance,"
2040,II.,"Her white walls gleaming through the vines of France,"
2041,II.,"And all was hushed, save where the footsteps fell,"
2042,II.,"On some high tower, of midnight sentinel."
2043,II.,But one still watched; no self-encircled woes
2044,II.,Chased from his lids the angel of repose;
2045,II.,"He watched, he wept, for thoughts of bitter years"
2046,II.,"Bowed his dark lashes, wet with burning tears"
2047,II.,His country's sufferings and her children's shame
2048,II.,Streamed o'er his memory like a forest's flame;
2049,II.,"Each treasured insult, each remembered wrong,"
2050,II.,Rolled through his heart and kindled into song.
2051,II.,His taper faded; and the morning gales
2052,II.,Swept through the world the war-song of Marseilles!
2053,II.,
2054,II.,"Now, while around the smiles of Peace expand,"
2055,II.,And Plenty's wreaths festoon the laughing land;
2056,II.,"While France ships outward her reluctant ore,"
2057,II.,And half our navy basks upon the shore;
2058,II.,From ruder themes our meek-eyed Muses turn
2059,II.,To crown with roses their enamelled urn.
2060,II.,
2061,II.,If e'er again return those awful days
2062,II.,"Whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon's blaze,"
2063,II.,"Whose grass was trampled by the soldier's heel,"
2064,II.,"Whose tides were reddened round the rushing  keel,"
2065,II.,God grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain
2066,II.,To rend the silence of our tented plain!
2067,II.,"When Gallia's flag its triple fold displays,"
2068,II.,Her marshalled legions peal the Marseillaise;
2069,II.,"When round the German close the war-clouds dim,"
2070,II.,Far through their shadows floats his battle-hymn;
2071,II.,"When, crowned with joy, the camps' of England ring,"
2072,II.,"A thousand voices shout, ""God save the King!"""
2073,II.,"When victory follows with our eagle's glance,"
2074,II.,Our nation's anthem pipes a country dance!
2075,II.,
2076,II.,"Some prouder Muse, when comes the hour at last,"
2077,II.,May shake our hillsides with her bugle-blast;
2078,II.,Not ours the task; but since the lyric dress
2079,II.,"Relieves the statelier with its sprightliness,"
2080,II.,"Hear an old song, which some, perchance, have seen"
2081,II.,In stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine.
2082,II.,There was an hour when patriots dared profane
2083,II.,The mast that Britain strove to bow in vain;
2084,II.,"And one, who listened to the tale of shame,"
2085,II.,"Whose heart still answered to that sacred name,"
2086,II.,Whose eye still followed o'er his country's tides
2087,II.,"Thy glorious flag, our brave Old Ironsides"
2088,II.,"From yon lone attic, on a smiling morn,"
2089,II.,Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn.
2090,II.,
2091,II.,
2092,II.,
2093,III.,III.
2094,III.,
2095,III.,"When florid Peace resumed her golden reign,"
2096,III.,"And arts revived, and valleys bloomed again,"
2097,III.,"While War still panted on his-broken blade,"
2098,III.,Once more the Muse her heavenly wing essayed.
2099,III.,"Rude was the song: some ballad, stern and wild,"
2100,III.,Lulled the light slumbers of the soldier's child;
2101,III.,"Or young romancer, with his threatening glance"
2102,III.,"And fearful fables of his bloodless lance,"
2103,III.,"Scared the soft fancy of the clinging girls,"
2104,III.,Whose snowy fingers smoothed his raven curls.
2105,III.,"But when long years the stately form had bent,"
2106,III.,"And faithless Memory her illusions lent,"
2107,III.,So vast the outlines of Tradition grew
2108,III.,"That History wondered at the shapes she drew,"
2109,III.,And veiled at length their too ambitious hues
2110,III.,Beneath the pinions of the Epic Muse.
2111,III.,
2112,III.,Far swept her wing; for stormier days had brought
2113,III.,With darker passions deeper tides of thought.
2114,III.,"The camp's harsh tumult and the conflict's glow,"
2115,III.,"The thrill of triumph and the gasp of woe,"
2116,III.,"The tender parting and the glad return,"
2117,III.,"The festal banquet and the funeral urn,"
2118,III.,And all the drama which at once uprears
2119,III.,"Its spectral shadows through the clash of spears,"
2120,III.,"From camp and field to echoing verse transferred,"
2121,III.,Swelled the proud song that listening nations heard.
2122,III.,Why floats the amaranth in eternal bloom
2123,III.,O'er Ilium's turrets and Achilles' tomb?
2124,III.,Why lingers fancy where the sunbeams smile
2125,III.,On Circe's gardens and Calypso's isle?
2126,III.,Why follows memory to the gate of Troy
2127,III.,Her plumed defender and his trembling boy?
2128,III.,"Lo! the blind dreamer, kneeling on the sand"
2129,III.,To trace these records with his doubtful hand;
2130,III.,"In fabled tones his own emotion flows,"
2131,III.,And other lips repeat his silent woes;
2132,III.,In Hector's infant see the babes that shun
2133,III.,"Those deathlike eyes, unconscious of the sun,"
2134,III.,"Or in his hero hear himself implore,"
2135,III.,"""Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more!"""
2136,III.,
2137,III.,Thus live undying through the lapse of time
2138,III.,The solemn legends of the warrior's clime;
2139,III.,"Like Egypt's pyramid or Paestum's fane,"
2140,III.,They stand the heralds of the voiceless plain.
2141,III.,"Yet not like them, for Time, by slow degrees,"
2142,III.,"Saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze,"
2143,III.,"And Isis sleeps beneath her subject Nile,"
2144,III.,And crumbled Neptune strews his Dorian pile;
2145,III.,"But Art's fair fabric, strengthening as it rears"
2146,III.,"Its laurelled columns through the mist of years,"
2147,III.,As the blue arches of the bending skies
2148,III.,"Still gird the torrent, following as it flies,"
2149,III.,"Spreads, with the surges bearing on mankind,"
2150,III.,Its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind!
2151,III.,
2152,III.,In vain the patriot asks some lofty lay
2153,III.,To dress in state our wars of yesterday.
2154,III.,"The classic days, those mothers of romance,"
2155,III.,That roused a nation for a woman's glance;
2156,III.,"The age of mystery, with its hoarded power,"
2157,III.,"That girt the tyrant in his storied tower,"
2158,III.,"Have passed and faded like a dream of youth,"
2159,III.,And riper eras ask for history's truth.
2160,III.,
2161,III.,"On other shores, above their mouldering towns,"
2162,III.,"In sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns,"
2163,III.,"Pride in its aisles and paupers at the door,"
2164,III.,Which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore.
2165,III.,"Simple and frail, our lowly temples throw"
2166,III.,Their slender shadows on the paths below;
2167,III.,"Scarce steal the winds, that sweep his woodland tracks,"
2168,III.,"The larch's perfume from the settler's axe,"
2169,III.,"Ere, like a vision of the morning air,"
2170,III.,His slight--framed steeple marks the house of prayer;
2171,III.,"Its planks all reeking and its paint undried,"
2172,III.,"Its rafters sprouting on the shady side,"
2173,III.,It sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves
2174,III.,Ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves.
2175,III.,
2176,III.,"Yet Faith's pure hymn, beneath its shelter rude,"
2177,III.,Breathes out as sweetly to the tangled wood
2178,III.,As where the rays through pictured glories pour
2179,III.,On marble shaft and tessellated floor;--
2180,III.,"Heaven asks no surplice round the heart that feels,"
2181,III.,And all is holy where devotion kneels.
2182,III.,Thus on the soil the patriot's knee should bend
2183,III.,Which holds the dust once living to defend;
2184,III.,"Where'er the hireling shrinks before the free,"
2185,III.,"Each pass becomes ""a new Thermopylae""!"
2186,III.,"Where'er the battles of the brave are won,"
2187,III.,"There every mountain ""looks on Marathon""!"
2188,III.,
2189,III.,Our fathers live; they guard in glory still
2190,III.,The grass-grown bastions of the fortressed hill;
2191,III.,"Still ring the echoes of the trampled gorge,"
2192,III.,With _God and Freedom. England and Saint George_!
2193,III.,The royal cipher on the captured gun
2194,III.,Mocks the sharp night-dews and the blistering sun;
2195,III.,"The red-cross banner shades its captor's bust,"
2196,III.,Its folds still loaded with the conflict's dust;
2197,III.,"The drum, suspended by its tattered marge,"
2198,III.,Once rolled and rattled to the Hessian's charge;
2199,III.,"The stars have floated from Britannia's mast,"
2200,III.,The redcoat's trumpets blown the rebel's blast.
2201,III.,
2202,III.,"Point to the summits where the brave have bled,"
2203,III.,Where every village claims its glorious dead;
2204,III.,"Say, when their bosoms met the bayonet's shock,"
2205,III.,Their only corselet was the rustic frock;
2206,III.,"Say, when they mustered to the gathering horn,"
2207,III.,"The titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn,"
2208,III.,"Yet, when their leader bade his lines advance,"
2209,III.,No musket wavered in the lion's glance;
2210,III.,"Say, when they fainted in the forced retreat,"
2211,III.,"They tracked the snow-drifts with their bleeding feet,"
2212,III.,"Yet still their banners, tossing in the blast,"
2213,III.,"Bore Ever Ready, faithful to the last,"
2214,III.,"Through storm and battle, till they waved again"
2215,III.,On Yorktown's hills and Saratoga's plain.
2216,III.,
2217,III.,"Then, if so fierce the insatiate patriot's flame,"
2218,III.,"Truth looks too pale and history seems too tame,"
2219,III.,"Bid him await some new Columbiad's page,"
2220,III.,"To gild the tablets of an iron age,"
2221,III.,"And save his tears, which yet may fall upon"
2222,III.,"Some fabled field, some fancied Washington!"
2223,III.,
2224,III.,
2225,III.,
2226,IV.,IV.
2227,IV.,
2228,IV.,"But once again, from their AEolian cave,"
2229,IV.,The winds of Genius wandered on the wave.
2230,IV.,"Tired of the scenes the timid pencil drew,"
2231,IV.,"Sick of the notes the sounding clarion blew,"
2232,IV.,Sated with heroes who had worn so long
2233,IV.,"The shadowy plumage of historic song,"
2234,IV.,"The new-born poet left the beaten course,"
2235,IV.,To track the passions to their living source.
2236,IV.,
2237,IV.,Then rose the Drama;--and the world admired
2238,IV.,Her varied page with deeper thought inspired
2239,IV.,"Bound to no clime, for Passion's throb is one"
2240,IV.,In Greenland's twilight or in India's sun;
2241,IV.,"Born for no age, for all the thoughts that roll"
2242,IV.,"In the dark vortex of the stormy soul,"
2243,IV.,"Unchained in song, no freezing years can tame;"
2244,IV.,"God gave them birth, and man is still the same."
2245,IV.,"So full on life her magic mirror shone,"
2246,IV.,Her sister Arts paid tribute to her throne;
2247,IV.,"One reared her temple, one her canvas warmed,"
2248,IV.,"And Music thrilled, while Eloquence informed."
2249,IV.,The weary rustic left his stinted task
2250,IV.,"For smiles and tears, the dagger and the mask;"
2251,IV.,"The sage, turned scholar, half forgot his lore,"
2252,IV.,To be the woman he despised before.
2253,IV.,"O'er sense and thought she threw her golden chain,"
2254,IV.,"And Time, the anarch, spares her deathless reign."
2255,IV.,
2256,IV.,"Thus lives Medea, in our tamer age,"
2257,IV.,As when her buskin pressed the Grecian stage;
2258,IV.,Not in the cells where frigid learning delves
2259,IV.,"In Aldine folios mouldering on their shelves,"
2260,IV.,"But breathing, burning in the glittering throng,"
2261,IV.,"Whose thousand bravoes roll untired along,"
2262,IV.,"Circling and spreading through the gilded halls,"
2263,IV.,From London's galleries to San Carlo's walls!
2264,IV.,
2265,IV.,Thus shall he live whose more than mortal name
2266,IV.,Mocks with its ray the pallid torch of Fame;
2267,IV.,So proudly lifted that it seems afar
2268,IV.,"No earthly Pharos, but a heavenly star,"
2269,IV.,"Who, unconfined to Art's diurnal bound,"
2270,IV.,"Girds her whole zodiac in his flaming round,"
2271,IV.,"And leads the passions, like the orb that guides,"
2272,IV.,"From pole to pole, the palpitating tides!"
2273,IV.,
2274,IV.,
2275,IV.,
2276,V.,V.
2277,V.,
2278,V.,"Though round the Muse the robe of song is thrown,"
2279,V.,Think not the poet lives in verse alone.
2280,V.,Long ere the chisel of the sculptor taught
2281,V.,The lifeless stone to mock the living thought;
2282,V.,Long ere the painter bade the canvas glow
2283,V.,With every line the forms of beauty know;
2284,V.,Long ere the iris of the Muses threw
2285,V.,"On every leaf its own celestial hue,"
2286,V.,"In fable's dress the breath of genius poured,"
2287,V.,And warmed the shapes that later times adored.
2288,V.,
2289,V.,Untaught by Science how to forge the keys
2290,V.,That loose the gates of Nature's mysteries;
2291,V.,"Unschooled by Faith, who, with her angel tread,"
2292,V.,"Leads through the labyrinth with a single thread,"
2293,V.,"His fancy, hovering round her guarded tower,"
2294,V.,Rained through its bars like Danae's golden shower.
2295,V.,
2296,V.,He spoke; the sea-nymph answered from her cave
2297,V.,He called; the naiad left her mountain wave
2298,V.,"He dreamed of beauty; lo, amidst his dream,"
2299,V.,"Narcissus, mirrored in the breathless stream;"
2300,V.,"And night's chaste empress, in her bridal play,"
2301,V.,Laughed through the foliage where Endymion lay;
2302,V.,"And ocean dimpled, as the languid swell"
2303,V.,Kissed the red lip of Cytherea's shell.
2304,V.,
2305,V.,"Of power,--Bellona swept the crimson field,"
2306,V.,And blue-eyed Pallas shook her Gorgon shield;
2307,V.,"O'er the hushed waves their mightier monarch drove,"
2308,V.,And Ida trembled to the tread of Jove!
2309,V.,
2310,V.,So every grace that plastic language knows
2311,V.,To nameless poets its perfection owes.
2312,V.,The rough-hewn words to simplest thoughts confined
2313,V.,Were cut and polished in their nicer mind;
2314,V.,"Caught on their edge, imagination's ray"
2315,V.,"Splits into rainbows, shooting far away;--"
2316,V.,"From sense to soul, from soul to sense, it flies,"
2317,V.,And through all nature links analogies;
2318,V.,He who reads right will rarely look upon
2319,V.,A better poet than his lexicon!
2320,V.,
2321,V.,"There is a race which cold, ungenial skies"
2322,V.,"Breed from decay, as fungous growths arise;"
2323,V.,"Though dying fast, yet springing fast again,"
2324,V.,"Which still usurps an unsubstantial reign,"
2325,V.,"With frames too languid for the charms of sense,"
2326,V.,And minds worn down with action too intense;
2327,V.,"Tired of a world whose joys they never knew,"
2328,V.,"Themselves deceived, yet thinking all untrue;"
2329,V.,"Scarce men without, and less than girls within,"
2330,V.,Sick of their life before its cares begin;--
2331,V.,"The dull disease, which drains their feeble hearts,"
2332,V.,"To life's decay some hectic thrill's imparts,"
2333,V.,"And lends a force which, like the maniac's power,"
2334,V.,Pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour.
2335,V.,
2336,V.,"And this is Genius! Say, does Heaven degrade"
2337,V.,"The manly frame, for health, for action made?"
2338,V.,"Break down the sinews, rack the brow with pains,"
2339,V.,"Blanch the right cheek and drain the purple veins,"
2340,V.,"To clothe the mind with more extended sway,"
2341,V.,Thus faintly struggling in degenerate clay?
2342,V.,
2343,V.,"No! gentle maid, too ready to admire,"
2344,V.,"Though false its notes, the pale enthusiast's lyre;"
2345,V.,"If this be genius, though its bitter springs"
2346,V.,"Glowed like the morn beneath Aurora's wings,"
2347,V.,Seek not the source whose sullen bosom feeds
2348,V.,"But fruitless flowers and dark, envenomed weeds."
2349,V.,
2350,V.,"But, if so bright the dear illusion seems,"
2351,V.,"Thou wouldst be partner of thy poet's dreams,"
2352,V.,"And hang in rapture on his bloodless charms,"
2353,V.,"Or die, like Raphael, in his angel arms,"
2354,V.,"Go and enjoy thy blessed lot,--to share"
2355,V.,In Cowper's gloom or Chatterton's despair!
2356,V.,
2357,V.,"Not such were they whom, wandering o'er the waves,"
2358,V.,"I looked to meet, but only found their graves;"
2359,V.,"If friendship's smile, the better part of fame,"
2360,V.,"Should lend my song the only wreath I claim,"
2361,V.,"Whose voice would greet me with a sweeter tone,"
2362,V.,"Whose living hand more kindly press my own,"
2363,V.,"Than theirs,--could Memory, as her silent tread"
2364,V.,"Prints the pale flowers that blossom o'er the dead,"
2365,V.,"Those breathless lips, now closed in peace, restore,"
2366,V.,Or wake those pulses hushed to beat no more?
2367,V.,
2368,V.,"Thou calm, chaste scholar! I can see thee now,"
2369,V.,"The first young laurels on thy pallid brow,"
2370,V.,O'er thy slight figure floating lightly down
2371,V.,"In graceful folds the academic gown,"
2372,V.,On thy curled lip the classic lines that taught
2373,V.,"How nice the mind that sculptured them with thought,"
2374,V.,"And triumph glistening in the clear blue eye,"
2375,V.,"Too bright to live,--but oh, too fair to die!"
2376,V.,
2377,V.,"And thou, dear friend, whom Science still deplores,"
2378,V.,"And Love still mourns, on ocean-severed shores,"
2379,V.,Though the bleak forest twice has bowed with snow
2380,V.,"Since thou wast laid its budding leaves below,"
2381,V.,"Thine image mingles with my closing strain,"

2495,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Throned in his awful eye;
2496,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,These were a Nation's champions
2497,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Her dread appeal to try.

3377,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"_Medio e fonte_,--Virtue has her faults,--"
3378,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,The clearest fountains taste of Epsom salts;
3379,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"We snatch the cup and lift to drain it dry,--"
3380,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Its central dimple holds a drowning fly
3381,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Strong is the pine by Maine's ambrosial streams,"
3382,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,But stronger augers pierce its thickest beams;
3383,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"No iron gate, no spiked and panelled door,"
3384,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Can keep out death, the postman, or the bore."
3385,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Oh for a world where peace and silence reign,"
3386,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,And blunted dulness verebrates in vain!
3387,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"--The door-bell jingles,--enter Richard Fox,"
3388,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,And takes this letter from his leathern box.
3389,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,
3390,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"""Dear Sir,--"
3391,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"In writing on a former day,"

3393,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"I now inform you in a single line,"
3394,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,On Thursday next our purpose is to dine.
3395,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"The act of feeding, as you understand,"
3396,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Is but a fraction of the work in hand;
3397,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Its nobler half is that ethereal meat
3398,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,The papers call 'the intellectual treat;'
3399,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Songs, speeches, toasts, around the festive board"
3400,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Drowned in the juice the College pumps afford;
3401,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"For only water flanks our knives and forks,"
3402,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"So, sink or float, we swim without the corks."
3403,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Yours is the art, by native genius taught,"
3404,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,To clothe in eloquence the naked thought;
3405,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Yours is the skill its music to prolong
3406,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Through the sweet effluence of mellifluous song;
3407,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Yours the quaint trick to cram the pithy line
3408,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,That cracks so crisply over bubbling wine;
3409,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"And since success your various gifts attends,"
3410,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"We--that is, I and all your numerous friends--"
3411,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Expect from you--your single self a host--
3412,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"A speech, a song, excuse me, and a toast;"
3413,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Nay, not to haggle on so small a claim,"
3414,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"A few of each, or several of the same."
3415,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"(Signed),      Yours, most truly, ________"""
3416,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,
3417,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"No! my sight must fail,--"
3418,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,If that ain't Judas on the largest scale!
3419,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Well, this is modest;--nothing else than that?"
3420,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,My coat? my boots? my pantaloons? my hat?
3421,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"My stick? my gloves? as well as all my wits,"
3422,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Learning and linen,--everything that fits!"
3423,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,
3424,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Jack, said my lady, is it grog you'll try,"
3425,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Or punch, or toddy, if perhaps you're dry?"
3426,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Ah, said the sailor, though I can't refuse,"
3427,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"You know, my lady, 't ain't for me to choose;"
3428,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"I'll take the grog to finish off my lunch,"
3429,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,And drink the toddy while you mix the punch.

3434,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Looks very red, because so very green.)"
3435,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"I rise--I rise--with unaffected fear,"
3436,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,(Louder!--speak louder!--who the deuce can hear?)
3437,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,I rise--I said--with undisguised dismay
3438,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"--Such are my feelings as I rise, I say"

3444,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Close at my elbow stir their lemonade;
3445,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Would you like Homer learn to write and speak,"
3446,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,That bench is groaning with its weight of Greek;
3447,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Behold the naturalist who in his teens
3448,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Found six new species in a dish of greens;
3449,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"And lo, the master in a statelier walk,"
3450,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Whose annual ciphering takes a ton of chalk;
3451,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"And there the linguist, who by common roots"
3452,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Thro' all their nurseries tracks old Noah's shoots,--"
3453,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"How Shem's proud children reared the Assyrian piles,"
3454,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,While Ham's were scattered through the Sandwich Isles!
3455,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,
3456,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"--Fired at the thought of all the present shows,"
3457,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,My kindling fancy down the future flows:

3472,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Not such as May to Marlborough Chapel brings,"
3473,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Lean, hungry, savage, anti-everythings,"
3474,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Copies of Luther in the pasteboard style,--"
3475,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"But genuine articles, the true Carlyle;"
3476,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,While far on high the blazing orb shall shed
3477,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Its central light on Harvard's holy head,"
3478,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,And learning's ensigns ever float unfurled
3479,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Here in the focus of the new-born world

3481,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Roars through the hall the thunder of applause,"
3482,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,One stormy gust of long-suspended Ahs!
3483,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,One whirlwind chaos of insane hurrahs!

3487,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"THE SONG. But this demands a briefer line,--"
3488,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"A shorter muse, and not the old long Nine;"
3489,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Long metre answers for a common song,"
3490,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Though common metre does not answer long.
3491,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,
3492,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,She came beneath the forest dome
3493,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"To seek its peaceful shade,"
3494,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"An exile from her ancient home,"
3495,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"A poor, forsaken maid;"

3504,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,The rising mart was seen;
3505,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"So, when the laden winds had brought"
3506,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Their showers of golden rain,"
3507,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Her lap some precious gleanings caught,"

3534,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Hard is the job to launch the desperate pun,"
3535,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,A pun-job dangerous as the Indian one.

3537,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Back from the object that you mean to hit,"
3538,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Like the strange missile which the Australian throws,"
3539,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Your verbal boomerang slaps you on the nose.

3547,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Thus great Achilles, who had shown his zeal"
3548,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"In healing wounds, died of a wounded heel;"
3549,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,"Unhappy chief, who, when in childhood doused,"
3550,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Had saved his bacon had his feet been soused
3551,PRESIDENT EVERETT'S INAUGURATION,Accursed heel that killed a hero stout

3718,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"It means, Be moderate in your meat,"
3719,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,And partly live to drink.
3720,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,For baser tribes the rivers flow
3721,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,That know not wine or song;
3722,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Man wants but little drink below,"
3723,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,But wants that little strong.

3727,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"That decks a monarch's crown,"
3728,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,One goblet holds a diadem
3729,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,Of rubies melted down!
3730,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"A fig for Caesar's blazing brow,"
3731,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"But, like the Egyptian queen,"
3732,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,Bid each dissolving jewel glow
3733,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,My thirsty lips between.

3739,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,To cluster on the wall;
3740,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,It was a bright Immortal's head
3741,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"They circled with the vine,"
3742,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,And o'er their best and bravest dead
3743,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,They poured the dark-red wine.
3744,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Then once again, etc."
3745,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,
3746,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,Methinks o'er every sparkling glass
3747,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Young Eros waves his wings,"
3748,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,And echoes o'er its dimples pass
3749,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,From dead Anacreon's strings;
3750,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"And, tossing round its beaded brim"
3751,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Their locks of floating gold,"
3752,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,With bacchant dance and choral hymn
3753,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,Return the nymphs of old.
3754,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Then once again, etc."

3756,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"A welcome then to joy and mirth,"
3757,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"From hearts as fresh as ours,"
3758,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,To scatter o'er the dust of earth
3759,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,Their sweetly mingled flowers;
3760,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,'T is Wisdom's self the cup that fills
3761,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"In spite of Folly's frown,"
3762,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"And Nature, from her vine-clad hills,"
3763,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,That rains her life-blood down!
3764,A SONG OF OTHER DAYS,"Then once again, before we part,"

3841,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),This poem was delivered before the Boston Mercantile Library
3842,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Association, October 14, 1846."
3843,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3844,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"YES, dear Enchantress,--wandering far and long,"
3845,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In realms unperfumed by the breath of song,"
3846,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where flowers ill-flavored shed their sweets around,"
3847,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground,"
3848,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose gems are crystals from the Epsom mine,"
3849,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine,"
3850,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose gates admit no mirthful feature in,"
3851,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Save one gaunt mocker, the Sardonic grin,"
3852,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose pangs are real, not the woes of rhyme"
3853,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That blue-eyed misses warble out of time;--
3854,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Truant, not recreant to thy sacred claim,"
3855,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Older by reckoning, but in heart the same,"
3856,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Freed for a moment from the chains of toil,"
3857,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I tread once more thy consecrated soil;
3858,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Here at thy feet my old allegiance own,"
3859,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thy subject still, and loyal to thy throne!"
3860,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3861,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),My dazzled glance explores the crowded hall;
3862,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Alas, how vain to hope the smiles of all!"
3863,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I know my audience. All the gay and young
3864,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Love the light antics of a playful tongue;
3865,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And these, remembering some expansive line"
3866,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"My lips let loose among the nuts and wine,"
3867,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are all impatience till the opening pun
3868,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Proclaims the witty shamfight is begun.
3869,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Two fifths at least, if not the total half,"
3870,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh;
3871,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I know full well what alderman has tied
3872,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),His red bandanna tight about his side;
3873,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I see the mother, who, aware that boys"
3874,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Perform their laughter with superfluous noise,"
3875,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Beside her kerchief brought an extra one
3876,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To stop the explosions of her bursting son;
3877,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know a tailor, once a friend of mine,"
3878,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Expects great doings in the button line,--"
3879,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For mirth's concussions rip the outward case,"
3880,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And plant the stitches in a tenderer place.
3881,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know my audience,--these shall have their due;"
3882,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A smile awaits them ere my song is through!
3883,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3884,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know myself. Not servile for applause,"
3885,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),My Muse permits no deprecating clause;
3886,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Modest or vain, she will not be denied"
3887,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),One bold confession due to honest pride;
3888,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And well she knows the drooping veil of song
3889,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Shall save her boldness from the caviller's wrong.
3890,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Her sweeter voice the Heavenly Maid imparts
3891,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To tell the secrets of our aching hearts
3892,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For this, a suppliant, captive, prostrate, bound,"
3893,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),She kneels imploring at the feet of sound;
3894,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For this, convulsed in thought's maternal pains,"
3895,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),She loads her arms with rhyme's resounding chains;
3896,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faint though the music of her fetters be,"
3897,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"It lends one charm,--her lips are ever free!"
3898,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3899,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Think not I come, in manhood's fiery noon,"
3900,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To steal his laurels from the stage buffoon;
3901,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),His sword of lath the harlequin may wield;
3902,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Behold the star upon my lifted shield
3903,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Though the just critic pass my humble name,"
3904,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And sweeter lips have drained the cup of fame,"
3905,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While my gay stanza pleased the banquet's lords,"
3906,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The soul within was tuned to deeper chords!
3907,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Say, shall my arms, in other conflicts taught"
3908,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To swing aloft the ponderous mace of thought,"
3909,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Lift, in obedience to a school-girl's law,"
3910,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Mirth's tinsel wand or laughter's tickling straw?
3911,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Say, shall I wound with satire's rankling spear"
3912,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The pure, warm hearts that bid me welcome here?"
3913,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No! while I wander through the land of dreams,"
3914,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To strive with great and play with trifling themes,"
3915,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Let some kind meaning fill the varied line.
3916,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),You have your judgment; will you trust to mine?
3917,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3918,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),. . . . . . . . . .
3919,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3920,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Between two breaths what crowded mysteries lie,--"
3921,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The first short gasp, the last and long-drawn sigh!"
3922,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Like phantoms painted on the magic slide,"
3923,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Forth from the darkness of the past we glide,"
3924,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),As living shadows for a moment seen
3925,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In airy pageant on the eternal screen,"
3926,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Traced by a ray from one unchanging flame,"
3927,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Then seek the dust and stillness whence we came.
3928,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3929,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But whence and why, our trembling souls inquire,"
3930,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Caught these dim visions their awakening fire?
3931,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh, who forgets when first the piercing thought"
3932,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through childhood's musings found its way unsought?
3933,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I AM;--I LIVE. The mystery and the fear
3934,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When the dread question, WHAT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE?"
3935,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Burst through life's twilight, as before the sun"
3936,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Roll the deep thunders of the morning gun!
3937,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3938,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Are angel faces, silent and serene,"
3939,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Bent on the conflicts of this little scene,"
3940,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose dream-like efforts, whose unreal strife,"
3941,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are but the preludes to a larger life?
3942,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3943,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Or does life's summer see the end of all,"
3944,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"These leaves of being mouldering as they fall,"
3945,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the old poet vaguely used to deem,"
3946,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),As WESLEY questioned in his youthful dream?
3947,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh, could such mockery reach our souls indeed,"
3948,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Give back the Pharaohs' or the Athenian's creed;
3949,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Better than this a Heaven of man's device,--"
3950,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Indian's sports, the Moslem's paradise!"
3951,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3952,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Or is our being's only end and aim
3953,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To add new glories to our Maker's name,"
3954,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the poor insect, shrivelling in the blaze,"
3955,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Lends a faint sparkle to its streaming rays?
3956,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Does earth send upward to the Eternal's ear
3957,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The mingled discords of her jarring sphere
3958,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To swell his anthem, while creation rings"
3959,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),With notes of anguish from its shattered strings?
3960,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Is it for this the immortal Artist means
3961,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"These conscious, throbbing, agonized machines?"
3962,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3963,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Dark is the soul whose sullen creed can bind
3964,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),In chains like these the all-embracing Mind;
3965,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No! two-faced bigot, thou dost ill reprove"
3966,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The sensual, selfish, yet benignant Jove,"
3967,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And praise a tyrant throned in lonely pride,"
3968,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who loves himself, and cares for naught beside;"
3969,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who gave thee, summoned from primeval night,"
3970,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A thousand laws, and not a single right,--"
3971,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A heart to feel, and quivering nerves to thrill,"
3972,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The sense of wrong, the death-defying will;"
3973,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who girt thy senses with this goodly frame,"
3974,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Its earthly glories and its orbs of flame,"
3975,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Not for thyself, unworthy of a thought,"
3976,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Poor helpless victim of a life unsought,"
3977,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But all for him, unchanging and supreme,"
3978,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The heartless centre of thy frozen scheme.
3979,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3980,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Trust not the teacher with his lying scroll,"
3981,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Who tears the charter of thy shuddering soul;
3982,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The God of love, who gave the breath that warms"
3983,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"All living dust in all its varied forms,"
3984,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Asks not the tribute of a world like this
3985,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To fill the measure of his perfect bliss.
3986,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Though winged with life through all its radiant shores,"
3987,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Creation flowed with unexhausted stores
3988,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Cherub and seraph had not yet enjoyed;
3989,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),For this he called thee from the quickening void!
3990,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Nor this alone; a larger gift was thine,"
3991,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A mightier purpose swelled his vast design
3992,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thought,--conscience,--will,--to make them all thine own,"
3993,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),He rent a pillar from the eternal throne!
3994,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
3995,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Made in his image, thou must nobly dare"
3996,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The thorny crown of sovereignty to share.
3997,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"With eye uplifted, it is thine to view,"
3998,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"From thine own centre, Heaven's o'erarching blue;"
3999,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So round thy heart a beaming circle lies
4000,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No fiend can blot, no hypocrite disguise;"
4001,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"From all its orbs one cheering voice is heard,"
4002,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Full to thine ear it bears the Father's word,"
4003,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Now, as in Eden where his first-born trod"
4004,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"""Seek thine own welfare, true to man and God!"""
4005,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Think not too meanly of thy low estate;
4006,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Thou hast a choice; to choose is to create!
4007,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Remember whose the sacred lips that tell,"
4008,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Angels approve thee when thy choice is well;
4009,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Remember, One, a judge of righteous men,"
4010,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Swore to spare Sodom if she held but ten!
4011,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Use well the freedom which thy Master gave,"
4012,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),(Think'st thou that Heaven can tolerate a slave?)
4013,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And He who made thee to be just and true
4014,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Will bless thee, love thee,--ay, respect thee too!"
4015,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4016,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Nature has placed thee on a changeful tide,"
4017,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To breast its waves, but not without a guide;"
4018,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet, as the needle will forget its aim,"
4019,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Jarred by the fury of the electric flame,"
4020,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the true current it will falsely feel,"
4021,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Warped from its axis by a freight of steel;
4022,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So will thy CONSCIENCE lose its balanced truth
4023,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If passion's lightning fall upon thy youth,"
4024,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So the pure effluence quit its sacred hold
4025,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Girt round too deeply with magnetic gold.
4026,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Go to yon tower, where busy science plies"
4027,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Her vast antennae, feeling through the skies"
4028,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That little vernier on whose slender lines
4029,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The midnight taper trembles as it shines,"
4030,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A silent index, tracks the planets' march"
4031,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),In all their wanderings through the ethereal arch;
4032,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tells through the mist where dazzled Mercury burns,"
4033,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And marks the spot where Uranus returns.
4034,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"So, till by wrong or negligence effaced,"
4035,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The living index which thy Maker traced
4036,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Repeats the line each starry Virtue draws
4037,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the wide circuit of creation's laws;
4038,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray
4039,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where the dark shadows of temptation stray,"
4040,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But, once defaced, forgets the orbs of light,"
4041,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And leaves thee wandering o'er the expanse of night.

4046,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Float upward on the smoke of sacrifice;

4048,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Of earth's two altars one was built by Cain!
4049,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Uncursed by doubt, our earliest creed we take;"
4050,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),We love the precepts for the teacher's sake;
4051,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The simple lessons which the nursery taught
4052,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Fell soft and stainless on the buds of thought,"
4053,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And the full blossom owes its fairest hue
4054,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To those sweet tear-drops of affection's dew.
4055,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Too oft the light that led our earlier hours
4056,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Fades with the perfume of our cradle flowers;
4057,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The clear, cold question chills to frozen doubt;"
4058,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tired of beliefs, we dread to live without"
4059,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh then, if Reason waver at thy side,"
4060,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Let humbler Memory be thy gentle guide;
4061,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Go to thy birthplace, and, if faith was there,"
4062,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Repeat thy father's creed, thy mother's prayer!"
4063,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4064,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faith loves to lean on Time's destroying arm,"
4065,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And age, like distance, lends a double charm;"
4066,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In dim cathedrals, dark with vaulted gloom,"
4067,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What holy awe invests the saintly tomb!
4068,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"There pride will bow, and anxious care expand,"
4069,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And creeping avarice come with open hand;
4070,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The gay can weep, the impious can adore,"
4071,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),From morn's first glimmerings on the chancel floor
4072,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Till dying sunset sheds his crimson stains
4073,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the faint halos of the irised panes.
4074,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet there are graves, whose rudely-shapen sod"
4075,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Bears the fresh footprints where the sexton trod;
4076,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Graves where the verdure has not dared to shoot,"
4077,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where the chance wild-flower has not fixed its root,"
4078,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose slumbering tenants, dead without a name,"
4079,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The eternal record shall at length proclaim
4080,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Pure as the holiest in the long array
4081,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Of hooded, mitred, or tiaraed clay!"
4082,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4083,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Come, seek the air; some pictures we may gain"
4084,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Whose passing shadows shall not be in vain;
4085,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Not from the scenes that crowd the stranger's soil,"
4086,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Not from our own amidst the stir of toil,"
4087,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But when the Sabbath brings its kind release,"
4088,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And Care lies slumbering on the lap of Peace.
4089,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4090,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The air is hushed, the street is holy ground;"
4091,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Hark! The sweet bells renew their welcome sound
4092,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As one by one awakes each silent tongue,"
4093,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),It tells the turret whence its voice is flung.
4094,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Chapel, last of sublunary things"
4095,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"That stirs our echoes with the name of Kings,"
4096,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose bell, just glistening from the font and forge,"
4097,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Rolled its proud requiem for the second George,"
4098,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Solemn and swelling, as of old it rang,"
4099,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Flings to the wind its deep, sonorous clang;"
4100,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The simpler pile, that, mindful of the hour"
4101,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When Howe's artillery shook its half-built tower,"
4102,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Wears on its bosom, as a bride might do,"
4103,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The iron breastpin which the ""Rebels"" threw,"
4104,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Wakes the sharp echoes with the quivering thrill
4105,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Of keen vibrations, tremulous and shrill;"
4106,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Aloft, suspended in the morning's fire,"
4107,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Crash the vast cymbals from the Southern spire;
4108,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Giant, standing by the elm-clad green,"
4109,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"His white lance lifted o'er the silent scene,"
4110,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whirling in air his brazen goblet round,"
4111,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Swings from its brim the swollen floods of sound;
4112,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While, sad with memories of the olden time,"
4113,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Throbs from his tower the Northern Minstrel's chime,--"
4114,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faint, single tones, that spell their ancient song,"
4115,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),But tears still follow as they breathe along.
4116,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4117,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Child of the soil, whom fortune sends to range"
4118,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where man and nature, faith and customs change,"
4119,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Borne in thy memory, each familiar tone"
4120,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Mourns on the winds that sigh in every zone.
4121,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),When Ceylon sweeps thee with her perfumed breeze
4122,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the warm billows of the Indian seas;
4123,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),When--ship and shadow blended both in one--
4124,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Flames o'er thy mast the equatorial sun,"
4125,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),From sparkling midnight to refulgent noon
4126,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Thy canvas swelling with the still monsoon;
4127,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When through thy shrouds the wild tornado sings,"
4128,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And thy poor sea-bird folds her tattered wings,--"
4129,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oft will delusion o'er thy senses steal,"
4130,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And airy echoes ring the Sabbath peal
4131,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Then, dim with grateful tears, in long array"
4132,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Rise the fair town, the island-studded bay,"
4133,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Home, with its smiling board, its cheering fire,"
4134,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The half-choked welcome of the expecting sire,"
4135,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The mother's kiss, and, still if aught remain,"
4136,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Our whispering hearts shall aid the silent strain.
4137,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Ah, let the dreamer o'er the taffrail lean"
4138,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To muse unheeded, and to weep unseen;"
4139,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Fear not the tropic's dews, the evening's chills,"
4140,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),His heart lies warm among his triple hills!
4141,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4142,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Turned from her path by this deceitful gleam,"
4143,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),My wayward fancy half forgets her theme.
4144,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),See through the streets that slumbered in repose
4145,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The living current of devotion flows,"
4146,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Its varied forms in one harmonious band
4147,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Age leading childhood by its dimpled hand;
4148,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Want, in the robe whose faded edges fall"
4149,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To tell of rags beneath the tartan shawl;
4150,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And wealth, in silks that, fluttering to appear,"
4151,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Lift the deep borders of the proud cashmere.
4152,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"See, but glance briefly, sorrow-worn and pale,"
4153,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Those sunken cheeks beneath the widow's veil;
4154,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Alone she wanders where with HIM she trod,"
4155,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No arm to stay her, but she leans on God."
4156,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While other doublets deviate here and there,"
4157,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What secret handcuff binds that pretty pair?
4158,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Compactest couple! pressing side to side,--"
4159,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Ah, the white bonnet that reveals the bride!"
4160,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"By the white neckcloth, with its straitened tie,"
4161,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The sober hat, the Sabbath-speaking eye,"
4162,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Severe and smileless, he that runs may read"
4163,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The stern disciple of Geneva's creed
4164,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Decent and slow, behold his solemn march;"
4165,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Silent he enters through yon crowded arch.
4166,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A livelier bearing of the outward man,"
4167,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The light-hued gloves, the undevout rattan,"
4168,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Now smartly raised or half profanely twirled,--"
4169,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A bright, fresh twinkle from the week-day world,--"
4170,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tell their plain story; yes, thine eyes behold"
4171,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A cheerful Christian from the liberal fold.
4172,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Down the chill street that curves in gloomiest shade
4173,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What marks betray yon solitary maid?
4174,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The cheek's red rose that speaks of balmier air,"
4175,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Celtic hue that shades her braided hair,"
4176,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The gilded missal in her kerchief tied,--"
4177,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Poor Nora, exile from Killarney's side!"
4178,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Sister in toil, though blanched by colder skies,"
4179,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"That left their azure in her downcast eyes,"
4180,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"See pallid Margaret, Labor's patient child,"
4181,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Scarce weaned from home, the nursling of the wild,"
4182,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where white Katahdin o'er the horizon shines,"
4183,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And broad Penobscot dashes through the pines.
4184,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Still, as she hastes, her careful fingers hold"
4185,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The unfailing hymn-book in its cambric fold.
4186,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Six days at drudgery's heavy wheel she stands,"
4187,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The seventh sweet morning folds her weary hands.
4188,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yes, child of suffering, thou mayst well be sure"
4189,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),He who ordained the Sabbath loves the poor!
4190,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4191,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"This weekly picture faithful Memory draws,"
4192,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Nor claims the noisy tribute of applause;
4193,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faint is the glow such barren hopes can lend,"
4194,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And frail the line that asks no loftier end.
4195,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Trust me, kind listener, I will yet beguile"
4196,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Thy saddened features of the promised smile.
4197,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"This magic mantle thou must well divide,"
4198,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),It has its sable and its ermine side;
4199,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet, ere the lining of the robe appears,"
4200,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Take thou in silence what I give in tears.
4201,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4202,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Dear listening soul, this transitory scene"
4203,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Of murmuring stillness, busily serene,--"
4204,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"This solemn pause, the breathing-space of man,"
4205,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The halt of toil's exhausted caravan,--"
4206,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Comes sweet with music to thy wearied ear;
4207,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Rise with its anthems to a holier sphere!
4208,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4209,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Deal meekly, gently, with the hopes that guide"
4210,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The lowliest brother straying from thy side
4211,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If right, they bid thee tremble for thine own;"
4212,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If wrong, the verdict is for God alone."
4213,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4214,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What though the champions of thy faith esteem
4215,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The sprinkled fountain or baptismal stream;
4216,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Shall jealous passions in unseemly strife
4217,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Cross their dark weapons o'er the waves of life?
4218,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4219,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Let my free soul, expanding as it can,"
4220,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Leave to his scheme the thoughtful Puritan;
4221,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),But Calvin's dogma shall my lips deride?
4222,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),In that stern faith my angel Mary died;
4223,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Or ask if mercy's milder creed can save,"
4224,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Sweet sister, risen from thy new-made grave?"
4225,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4226,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"True, the harsh founders of thy church reviled"
4227,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"That ancient faith, the trust of Erin's child;"
4228,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Must thou be raking in the crumbled past
4229,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),For racks and fagots in her teeth to cast?
4230,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),See from the ashes of Helvetia's pile
4231,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The whitened skull of old Servetus smile!
4232,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Round her young heart thy ""Romish Upas"" threw"
4233,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Its firm, deep fibres, strengthening as she grew;"
4234,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thy sneering voice may call them ""Popish tricks,"""
4235,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Her Latin prayers, her dangling crucifix,"
4236,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But De Profundis blessed her father's grave,"
4237,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"That ""idol"" cross her dying mother gave!"
4238,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What if some angel looks with equal eyes
4239,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"On her and thee, the simple and the wise,"
4240,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Writes each dark fault against thy brighter creed,"
4241,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And drops a tear with every foolish bead!
4242,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Grieve, as thou must, o'er history's reeking page;"
4243,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Blush for the wrongs that stain thy happier age;
4244,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Strive with the wanderer from the better path,"
4245,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Bearing thy message meekly, not in wrath;"
4246,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Weep for the frail that err, the weak that fall,"
4247,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Have thine own faith,--but hope and pray for all!"
4248,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4249,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faith; Conscience; Love. A meaner task remains,"
4250,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And humbler thoughts must creep in lowlier strains.
4251,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Shalt thou be honest? Ask the worldly schools,"
4252,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And all will tell thee knaves are busier fools;
4253,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Prudent? Industrious? Let not modern pens
4254,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Instruct ""Poor Richard's"" fellow-citizens."
4255,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4256,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Be firm! One constant element in luck
4257,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Is genuine solid old Teutonic pluck.
4258,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"See yon tall shaft; it felt the earthquake's thrill,"
4259,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Clung to its base, and greets the sunrise still."
4260,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4261,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Stick to your aim: the mongrel's hold will slip,"
4262,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),But only crowbars loose the bulldog's grip;
4263,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Small as he looks, the jaw that never yields"
4264,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Drags down the bellowing monarch of the fields!
4265,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4266,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet in opinions look not always back,--"
4267,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Your wake is nothing, mind the coming track;"
4268,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Leave what you've done for what you have to do;
4269,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Don't be ""consistent,"" but be simply true."
4270,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4271,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Don't catch the fidgets; you have found your place
4272,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Just in the focus of a nervous race,"
4273,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Fretful to change and rabid to discuss,"
4274,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Full of excitements, always in a fuss."
4275,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Think of the patriarchs; then compare as men
4276,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),These lean-cheeked maniacs of the tongue and pen!
4277,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Run, if you like, but try to keep your breath;"
4278,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Work like a man, but don't be worked to death;"
4279,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And with new notions,--let me change the rule,--"
4280,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Don't strike the iron till it 's slightly cool.
4281,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4282,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Choose well your set; our feeble nature seeks
4283,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The aid of clubs, the countenance of cliques;"
4284,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And with this object settle first of all
4285,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Your weight of metal and your size of ball.
4286,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Track not the steps of such as hold you cheap,"
4287,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Too mean to prize, though good enough to keep;"
4288,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The ""real, genuine, no-mistake Tom Thumbs"""
4289,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are little people fed on great men's crumbs.
4290,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Yet keep no followers of that hateful brood
4291,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That basely mingles with its wholesome food
4292,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The tumid reptile, which, the poet said,"
4293,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Doth wear a precious jewel in his head.
4294,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4295,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If the wild filly, ""Progress,"" thou wouldst ride,"

4305,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4306,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Does praise delight thee? Choose some _ultra_ side,--"
4307,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A sure old recipe, and often tried;"
4308,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Be its apostle, congressman, or bard,"
4309,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Spokesman or jokesman, only drive it hard;"
4310,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But know the forfeit which thy choice abides,"
4311,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For on two wheels the poor reformer rides,--"
4312,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"One black with epithets the _anti_ throws,"
4313,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),One white with flattery painted by the pros.
4314,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4315,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Though books on MANNERS are not out of print,"
4316,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),An honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.
4317,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Stop not, unthinking, every friend you meet,"
4318,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To spin your wordy fabric in the street;
4319,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While you are emptying your colloquial pack,"
4320,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The fiend Lumbago jumps upon his back.
4321,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Nor cloud his features with the unwelcome tale

4323,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Health is a subject for his child, his wife,"
4324,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And the rude office that insures his life.
4325,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Look in his face, to meet thy neighbor's soul,"
4326,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Not on his garments, to detect a hole;"

4329,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh, what a precious book the one would be"
4330,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That taught observers what they 're NOT to see!
4331,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
4332,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I tell in verse--'t were better done in prose--

4335,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"How long it sticks, how hard it is to change."
4336,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Two friendly people, both disposed to smile,"
4337,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who meet, like others, every little while,"
4338,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Instead of passing with a pleasant bow,"
4339,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And ""How d' ye do?"" or ""How 's your uncle now?"""

4345,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Each looks quite radiant, seems extremely struck,"
4346,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Their meeting so was such a piece of luck;
4347,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Each thinks the other thinks he 's greatly pleased
4348,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To screw the vice in which they both are squeezed;

4732,(TERPSICHORE),"Delusive error, as at trifling charge"
4733,(TERPSICHORE),Professor Gripes will certify at large;
4734,(TERPSICHORE),"Mesmeric pamphlets, which to facts appeal,"

4736,(TERPSICHORE),"And figured heads, whose hieroglyphs invite"
4737,(TERPSICHORE),To wandering knaves that discount fools at sight:
4738,(TERPSICHORE),"Such things as these, with heaps of unpaid bills,"
4739,(TERPSICHORE),"And candy puffs and homoeopathic pills,"
4740,(TERPSICHORE),"And ancient bell-crowns with contracted rim,"

4743,(TERPSICHORE),"Their sequels tapering like a lizard's tale,--"
4744,(TERPSICHORE),"How might we spread them to the smiling day,"

4761,(TERPSICHORE),"So, many a tongue the evening hour prolongs"
4762,(TERPSICHORE),"With spangled speeches,--let alone the songs;"
4763,(TERPSICHORE),"Statesmen grow merry, lean attorneys laugh,"
4764,(TERPSICHORE),"And weak teetotals warm to half and half,"
4765,(TERPSICHORE),"And beardless Tullys, new to festive scenes,"
4766,(TERPSICHORE),"Cut their first crop of youth's precocious greens,"
4767,(TERPSICHORE),"And wits stand ready for impromptu claps,"
4768,(TERPSICHORE),"With loaded barrels and percussion caps,"
4769,(TERPSICHORE),"And Pathos, cantering through the minor keys,"
4770,(TERPSICHORE),Waves all her onions to the trembling breeze;
4771,(TERPSICHORE),While the great Feasted views with silent glee

4773,(TERPSICHORE),
4774,(TERPSICHORE),Sweet is the scene where genial friendship plays
4775,(TERPSICHORE),The pleasing game of interchanging praise.
4776,(TERPSICHORE),"Self-love, grimalkin of the human heart,"
4777,(TERPSICHORE),Is ever pliant to the master's art;
4778,(TERPSICHORE),"Soothed with a word, she peacefully withdraws"
4779,(TERPSICHORE),"And sheathes in velvet her obnoxious claws,"
4780,(TERPSICHORE),And thrills the hand that smooths her glossy fur
4781,(TERPSICHORE),With the light tremor of her grateful purr.
4782,(TERPSICHORE),
4783,(TERPSICHORE),"But what sad music fills the quiet hall,"
4784,(TERPSICHORE),If on her back a feline rival fall!
4785,(TERPSICHORE),"And oh, what noises shake the tranquil house"
4786,(TERPSICHORE),If old Self-interest cheats her of a mouse.
4787,(TERPSICHORE),
4788,(TERPSICHORE),"Thou, O my country, hast thy foolish ways,"
4789,(TERPSICHORE),Too apt to purr at every stranger's praise;
4790,(TERPSICHORE),"But if the stranger touch thy modes or laws,"
4791,(TERPSICHORE),Off goes the velvet and out come the claws!
4792,(TERPSICHORE),"And thou, Illustrious! but too poorly paid"
4793,(TERPSICHORE),"In toasts from Pickwick for thy great crusade,"
4794,(TERPSICHORE),"Though, while the echoes labored with thy name,"
4795,(TERPSICHORE),"The public trap denied thy little game,"
4796,(TERPSICHORE),"Let other lips our jealous laws revile,--"
4797,(TERPSICHORE),"The marble Talfourd or the rude Carlyle,--"
4798,(TERPSICHORE),"But on thy lids, which Heaven forbids to close"
4799,(TERPSICHORE),"Where'er the light of kindly nature glows,"
4800,(TERPSICHORE),Let not the dollars that a churl denies
4801,(TERPSICHORE),Weigh like the shillings on a dead man's eyes!
4802,(TERPSICHORE),"Or, if thou wilt, be more discreetly blind,"
4803,(TERPSICHORE),Nor ask to see all wide extremes combined.
4804,(TERPSICHORE),Not in our wastes the dainty blossoms smile
4805,(TERPSICHORE),That crowd the gardens of thy scanty isle.
4806,(TERPSICHORE),There white-cheeked Luxury weaves a thousand charms;
4807,(TERPSICHORE),Here sun-browned Labor swings his naked arms.
4808,(TERPSICHORE),Long are the furrows he must trace between
4809,(TERPSICHORE),The ocean's azure and the prairie's green;
4810,(TERPSICHORE),"Full many a blank his destined realm displays,"
4811,(TERPSICHORE),Yet sees the promise of his riper days
4812,(TERPSICHORE),"Far through yon depths the panting engine moves,"
4813,(TERPSICHORE),His chariots ringing in their steel-shod grooves;
4814,(TERPSICHORE),And Erie's naiad flings her diamond wave
4815,(TERPSICHORE),O'er the wild sea-nymph in her distant cave!
4816,(TERPSICHORE),"While tasks like these employ his anxious hours,"
4817,(TERPSICHORE),What if his cornfields are not edged with flowers?
4818,(TERPSICHORE),Though bright as silver the meridian beams
4819,(TERPSICHORE),"Shine through the crystal of thine English streams,"
4820,(TERPSICHORE),Turbid and dark the mighty wave is whirled
4821,(TERPSICHORE),That drains our Andes and divides a world!
4822,(TERPSICHORE),
4823,(TERPSICHORE),But lo! a PARCHMENT! Surely it would seem
4824,(TERPSICHORE),The sculptured impress speaks of power supreme;
4825,(TERPSICHORE),Some grave design the solemn page must claim
4826,(TERPSICHORE),That shows so broadly an emblazoned name.
4827,(TERPSICHORE),"A sovereign's promise! Look, the lines afford"
4828,(TERPSICHORE),All Honor gives when Caution asks his word:
4829,(TERPSICHORE),"There sacred Faith has laid her snow-white hands,"
4830,(TERPSICHORE),And awful Justice knit her iron bands;
4831,(TERPSICHORE),"Yet every leaf is stained with treachery's dye,"
4832,(TERPSICHORE),And every letter crusted with a lie.
4833,(TERPSICHORE),Alas! no treason has degraded yet
4834,(TERPSICHORE),"The Arab's salt, the Indian's calumet;"
4835,(TERPSICHORE),"A simple rite, that bears the wanderer's pledge,"
4836,(TERPSICHORE),Blunts the keen shaft and turns the dagger's edge;
4837,(TERPSICHORE),"While jockeying senates stop to sign and seal,"
4838,(TERPSICHORE),And freeborn statesmen legislate to steal.
4839,(TERPSICHORE),"Rise, Europe, tottering with thine Atlas load,"
4840,(TERPSICHORE),"Turn thy proud eye to Freedom's blest abode,"
4841,(TERPSICHORE),"And round her forehead, wreathed with heavenly flame,"
4842,(TERPSICHORE),Bind the dark garland of her daughter's shame!
4843,(TERPSICHORE),"Ye ocean clouds, that wrap the angry blast,"
4844,(TERPSICHORE),"Coil her stained ensign round its haughty mast,"
4845,(TERPSICHORE),"Or tear the fold that wears so foul a scar,"
4846,(TERPSICHORE),And drive a bolt through every blackened star!
4847,(TERPSICHORE),"Once more,--once only,--- we must stop so soon:"
4848,(TERPSICHORE),What have we here? A GERMAN-SILVER SPOON;
4849,(TERPSICHORE),"A cheap utensil, which we often see"
4850,(TERPSICHORE),"Used by the dabblers in aesthetic tea,"
4851,(TERPSICHORE),"Of slender fabric, somewhat light and thin,"
4852,(TERPSICHORE),"Made of mixed metal, chiefly lead and tin;"
4853,(TERPSICHORE),"The bowl is shallow, and the handle small,"
4854,(TERPSICHORE),Marked in large letters with the name JEAN PAUL.
4855,(TERPSICHORE),"Small as it is, its powers are passing strange,"
4856,(TERPSICHORE),For all who use it show a wondrous change;
4857,(TERPSICHORE),"And first, a fact to make the barbers stare,"
4858,(TERPSICHORE),It beats Macassar for the growth of hair.
4859,(TERPSICHORE),See those small youngsters whose expansive ears
4860,(TERPSICHORE),Maternal kindness grazed with frequent shears;
4861,(TERPSICHORE),"Each bristling crop a dangling mass becomes,"
4862,(TERPSICHORE),And all the spoonies turn to Absaloms
4863,(TERPSICHORE),"Nor this alone its magic power displays,"
4864,(TERPSICHORE),It alters strangely all their works and ways;
4865,(TERPSICHORE),"With uncouth words they tire their tender lungs,"
4866,(TERPSICHORE),The same bald phrases on their hundred tongues
4867,(TERPSICHORE),"""Ever"" ""The Ages"" in their page appear,"
4868,(TERPSICHORE),"""Alway"" the bedlamite is called a ""Seer;"""
4869,(TERPSICHORE),"On every leaf the ""earnest"" sage may scan,"
4870,(TERPSICHORE),"Portentous bore! their ""many-sided"" man,--"
4871,(TERPSICHORE),"A weak eclectic, groping vague and dim,"
4872,(TERPSICHORE),"Whose every angle is a half-starved whim,"
4873,(TERPSICHORE),"Blind as a mole and curious as a lynx,"
4874,(TERPSICHORE),"Who rides a beetle, which he calls a ""Sphinx."""
4875,(TERPSICHORE),"And oh, what questions asked in clubfoot rhyme"
4876,(TERPSICHORE),Of Earth the tongueless and the deaf-mute Time!
4877,(TERPSICHORE),
4878,(TERPSICHORE),"Here babbling ""Insight"" shouts in Nature's ears"
4879,(TERPSICHORE),His last conundrum on the orbs and spheres;
4880,(TERPSICHORE),"There Self-inspection sucks its little thumb,"
4881,(TERPSICHORE),"With ""Whence am I?"" and ""Wherefore did I come?"""
4882,(TERPSICHORE),Deluded infants! will they ever know
4883,(TERPSICHORE),"Some doubts must darken o'er the world below,"
4884,(TERPSICHORE),Though all the Platos of the nursery trail
4885,(TERPSICHORE),"Their ""clouds of glory"" at the go-cart's tail?"
4886,(TERPSICHORE),Oh might these couplets their attention claim
4887,(TERPSICHORE),That gain their author the Philistine's name
4888,(TERPSICHORE),"(A stubborn race, that, spurning foreign law,"
4889,(TERPSICHORE),Was much belabored with an ass's jaw.)
4890,(TERPSICHORE),
4891,(TERPSICHORE),Melodious Laura! From the sad retreats
4892,(TERPSICHORE),"That hold thee, smothered with excess of sweets,"
4893,(TERPSICHORE),"Shade of a shadow, spectre of a dream,"
4894,(TERPSICHORE),Glance thy wan eye across the Stygian stream!
4895,(TERPSICHORE),"The slipshod dreamer treads thy fragrant halls,"
4896,(TERPSICHORE),"The sophist's cobwebs hang thy roseate walls,"
4897,(TERPSICHORE),And o'er the crotchets of thy jingling tunes
4898,(TERPSICHORE),"The bard of mystery scrawls his crooked ""runes."""
4899,(TERPSICHORE),"Yes, thou art gone, with all the tuneful hordes"
4900,(TERPSICHORE),"That candied thoughts in amber-colored words,"
4901,(TERPSICHORE),And in the precincts of thy late abodes
4902,(TERPSICHORE),The clattering verse-wright hammers Orphic odes.
4903,(TERPSICHORE),"Thou, soft as zephyr, wast content to fly"
4904,(TERPSICHORE),On the gilt pinions of a balmy sigh;
4905,(TERPSICHORE),"He, vast as Phoebus on his burning wheels,"
4906,(TERPSICHORE),Would stride through ether at Orion's heels.
4907,(TERPSICHORE),"Thy emblem, Laura, was a perfume-jar,"
4908,(TERPSICHORE),"And thine, young Orpheus, is a pewter star."

4918,(TERPSICHORE),"To-morrow bids thee, with rebuking frown,"
4919,(TERPSICHORE),"Change thy gauze tunic for a home-made gown,"
4920,(TERPSICHORE),Too blest by fortune if the passing day

5034,THE MORNING VISIT,Learn the sweet magic of a cheerful face;
5035,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not always smiling, but at least serene,"
5036,THE MORNING VISIT,When grief and anguish cloud the anxious scene.
5037,THE MORNING VISIT,"Each look, each movement, every word and tone,"
5038,THE MORNING VISIT,Should tell your patient you are all his own;
5039,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not the mere artist, purchased to attend,"
5040,THE MORNING VISIT,"But the warm, ready, self-forgetting friend,"
5041,THE MORNING VISIT,Whose genial visit in itself combines

5047,THE MORNING VISIT,Her babbling homage from the tongue of Fame;

5120,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD
5121,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5122,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"THERE was a young man in Boston town,"
5123,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"He bought him a stethoscope nice and new,"
5124,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"All mounted and finished and polished down,"
5125,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With an ivory cap and a stopper too.
5126,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5127,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"It happened a spider within did crawl,"
5128,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And spun him a web of ample size,"
5129,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Wherein there chanced one day to fall
5130,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A couple of very imprudent flies.
5131,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5132,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The first was a bottle-fly, big and blue,"
5133,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The second was smaller, and thin and long;"
5134,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So there was a concert between the two,"
5135,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Like an octave flute and a tavern gong.
5136,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5137,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now being from Paris but recently,"
5138,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,This fine young man would show his skill;
5139,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And so they gave him, his hand to try,"
5140,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A hospital patient extremely ill.
5141,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5142,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Some said that his liver was short of bile,"
5143,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And some that his heart was over size,"
5144,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"While some kept arguing, all the while,"
5145,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,He was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes.
5146,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5147,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"This fine young man then up stepped he,"
5148,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And all the doctors made a pause;
5149,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Said he, The man must die, you see,"
5150,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,By the fifty-seventh of Louis's laws.
5151,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5152,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"But since the case is a desperate one,"
5153,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To explore his chest it may be well;
5154,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"For if he should die and it were not done,"
5155,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,You know the autopsy would not tell.
5156,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5157,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Then out his stethoscope he took,"
5158,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And on it placed his curious ear;
5159,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Mon Dieu! said he, with a knowing look,"
5160,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Why, here is a sound that 's mighty queer."
5161,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5162,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The bourdonnement is very clear,--"
5163,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Amphoric buzzing, as I'm alive"
5164,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Five doctors took their turn to hear;
5165,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Amphoric buzzing, said all the five."
5166,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5167,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,There's empyema beyond a doubt;
5168,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,We'll plunge a trocar in his side.
5169,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The diagnosis was made out,--"
5170,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,They tapped the patient; so he died.
5171,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5172,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Now such as hate new-fashioned toys
5173,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Began to look extremely glum;
5174,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They said that rattles were made for boys,"
5175,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And vowed that his buzzing was all a hum.
5176,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5177,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"There was an old lady had long been sick,"
5178,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And what was the matter none did know
5179,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Her pulse was slow, though her tongue was quick;"
5180,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To her this knowing youth must go.
5181,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5182,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So there the nice old lady sat,"
5183,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With phials and boxes all in a row;
5184,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"She asked the young doctor what he was at,"
5185,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To thump her and tumble her ruffles so.
5186,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5187,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now, when the stethoscope came out,"
5188,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The flies began to buzz and whiz
5189,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Oh ho! the matter is clear, no doubt;"
5190,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,An aneurism there plainly is.
5191,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5192,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The bruit de rape and the bruit de scie
5193,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And the bruit de diable are all combined;
5194,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"How happy Bouillaud would be,"
5195,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,If he a case like this could find!
5196,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5197,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now, when the neighboring doctors found"
5198,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"A case so rare had been descried,"
5199,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,They every day her ribs did pound
5200,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,In squads of twenty; so she died.
5201,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5202,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Then six young damsels, slight and frail,"
5203,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Received this kind young doctor's cares;
5204,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They all were getting slim and pale,"
5205,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And short of breath on mounting stairs.
5206,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5207,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They all made rhymes with ""sighs"" and ""skies,"""
5208,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And loathed their puddings and buttered rolls,"
5209,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And dieted, much to their friends' surprise,"
5210,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,On pickles and pencils and chalk and coals.
5211,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5212,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So fast their little hearts did bound,"
5213,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The frightened insects buzzed the more;
5214,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,So over all their chests he found
5215,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The rale sifflant and the rale sonore.
5216,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5217,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"He shook his head. There's grave disease,--"
5218,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,I greatly fear you all must die;
5219,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"A slight post-mortem, if you please,"
5220,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Surviving friends would gratify.
5221,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5222,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The six young damsels wept aloud,"
5223,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Which so prevailed on six young men
5224,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"That each his honest love avowed,"
5225,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Whereat they all got well again.
5226,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5227,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,This poor young man was all aghast;
5228,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The price of stethoscopes came down;
5229,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And so he was reduced at last
5230,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To practise in a country town.
5231,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5232,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The doctors being very sore,"
5233,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A stethoscope they did devise
5234,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"That had a rammer to clear the bore,"
5235,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With a knob at the end to kill the flies.
5236,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
5237,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now use your ears, all you that can,"
5238,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"But don't forget to mind your eyes,"
5239,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Or you may be cheated, like this young man,"
5240,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"By a couple of silly, abnormal flies."

5473,CANTO FIRST,"A lazy, sleepy, curious kind of chap;"
5474,CANTO FIRST,"He, like his grandsire, took a mighty nap,"
5475,CANTO FIRST,Whereof the story I propose to tell
5476,CANTO FIRST,"In two brief cantos, if you listen well."
5477,CANTO FIRST,
5478,CANTO FIRST,The times were hard when Rip to manhood grew;
5479,CANTO FIRST,They always will be when there's work to do.
5480,CANTO FIRST,"He tried at farming,--found it rather slow,--"
5481,CANTO FIRST,And then at teaching--what he did n't know;
5482,CANTO FIRST,"Then took to hanging round the tavern bars,"
5483,CANTO FIRST,"To frequent toddies and long-nine cigars,"
5484,CANTO FIRST,"Till Dame Van Winkle, out of patience, vexed"

5490,CANTO FIRST,
5491,CANTO FIRST,The die was cast; the youngster was content;
5492,CANTO FIRST,"They packed his shirts and stockings, and he went."
5493,CANTO FIRST,How hard he studied it were vain to tell;
5494,CANTO FIRST,"He drowsed through Wistar, nodded over Bell,"
5495,CANTO FIRST,"Slept sound with Cooper, snored aloud on Good;"
5496,CANTO FIRST,"Heard heaps of lectures,--doubtless understood,--"
5497,CANTO FIRST,"A constant listener, for he did not fail"
5498,CANTO FIRST,To carve his name on every bench and rail.
5499,CANTO FIRST,
5500,CANTO FIRST,"Months grew to years; at last he counted three,"
5501,CANTO FIRST,And Rip Van Winkle found himself M. D.
5502,CANTO FIRST,Illustrious title! in a gilded frame
5503,CANTO FIRST,"He set the sheepskin with his Latin name,"
5504,CANTO FIRST,"RIPUM VAN WINKLUM, QUEM we--SCIMUS--know"

5537,CANTO FIRST,"Leeches, sweet vermin! don't they charm the sick?"

5551,CANTO FIRST,
5552,CANTO FIRST,"The surest foot may chance at last to slip,"
5553,CANTO FIRST,And so at length it proved with Doctor Rip.
5554,CANTO FIRST,"One full-sized bottle stood upon the shelf,"
5555,CANTO FIRST,Which held the medicine that he took himself;
5556,CANTO FIRST,"Whate'er the reason, it must be confessed"
5557,CANTO FIRST,He filled that bottle oftener than the rest;
5558,CANTO FIRST,What drug it held I don't presume to know--
5559,CANTO FIRST,"The gilded label said ""Elixir Pro."""
5560,CANTO FIRST,
5561,CANTO FIRST,"One day the Doctor found the bottle full,"
5562,CANTO FIRST,"And, being thirsty, took a vigorous pull,"
5563,CANTO FIRST,"Put back the ""Elixir"" where 't was always found,"
5564,CANTO FIRST,And had old Dobbin saddled and brought round.
5565,CANTO FIRST,--You know those old-time rhubarb-colored nags
5566,CANTO FIRST,That carried Doctors and their saddle-bags;
5567,CANTO FIRST,Sagacious beasts! they stopped at every place
5568,CANTO FIRST,Where blinds were shut--knew every patient's case--
5569,CANTO FIRST,Looked up and thought--The baby's in a fit--
5570,CANTO FIRST,That won't last long--he'll soon be through with it;
5571,CANTO FIRST,But shook their heads before the knockered door
5572,CANTO FIRST,Where some old lady told the story o'er
5573,CANTO FIRST,Whose endless stream of tribulation flows
5574,CANTO FIRST,For gastric griefs and peristaltic woes.
5575,CANTO FIRST,
5576,CANTO FIRST,"What jack-o'-lantern led him from his way,"
5577,CANTO FIRST,"And where it led him, it were hard to say;"
5578,CANTO FIRST,Enough that wandering many a weary mile
5579,CANTO FIRST,"Through paths the mountain sheep trod single file,"
5580,CANTO FIRST,O'ercome by feelings such as patients know
5581,CANTO FIRST,"Who dose too freely with ""Elixir Pro.,"""
5582,CANTO FIRST,"He tumbl--dismounted, slightly in a heap,"
5583,CANTO FIRST,"And lay, promiscuous, lapped in balmy sleep."
5584,CANTO FIRST,
5585,CANTO FIRST,"Night followed night, and day succeeded day,"
5586,CANTO FIRST,But snoring still the slumbering Doctor lay.
5587,CANTO FIRST,"Poor Dobbin, starving, thought upon his stall,"
5588,CANTO FIRST,"And straggled homeward, saddle-bags and all."
5589,CANTO FIRST,"The village people hunted all around,"
5590,CANTO FIRST,"But Rip was missing,--never could be found."
5591,CANTO FIRST,"""Drownded,"" they guessed;--for more than half a year"
5592,CANTO FIRST,The pouts and eels did taste uncommon queer;
5593,CANTO FIRST,Some said of apple-brandy--other some
5594,CANTO FIRST,Found a strong flavor of New England rum.
5595,CANTO FIRST,
5596,CANTO FIRST,Why can't a fellow hear the fine things said
5597,CANTO FIRST,About a fellow when a fellow's dead?
5598,CANTO FIRST,The best of doctors--so the press declared--
5599,CANTO FIRST,"A public blessing while his life was spared,"
5600,CANTO FIRST,"True to his country, bounteous to the poor,"
5601,CANTO FIRST,"In all things temperate, sober, just, and pure;"
5602,CANTO FIRST,"The best of husbands! echoed Mrs. Van,"
5603,CANTO FIRST,And set her cap to catch another man.
5604,CANTO FIRST,
5605,CANTO FIRST,"So ends this Canto--if it's quantum suff.,"
5606,CANTO FIRST,"We'll just stop here and say we've had enough,"
5607,CANTO FIRST,And leave poor Rip to sleep for thirty years;
5608,CANTO FIRST,I grind the organ--if you lend your ears
5609,CANTO FIRST,"To hear my second Canto, after that"
5610,CANTO FIRST,We 'll send around the monkey with the hat.
5611,CANTO FIRST,
5612,CANTO FIRST,
5613,CANTO SECOND,CANTO SECOND
5614,CANTO SECOND,
5615,CANTO SECOND,So thirty years had passed--but not a word
5616,CANTO SECOND,In all that time of Rip was ever heard;
5617,CANTO SECOND,The world wagged on--it never does go back--
5618,CANTO SECOND,The widow Van was now the widow Mac----
5619,CANTO SECOND,"France was an Empire--Andrew J. was dead,"
5620,CANTO SECOND,And Abraham L. was reigning in his stead.
5621,CANTO SECOND,"Four murderous years had passed in savage strife,"
5622,CANTO SECOND,Yet still the rebel held his bloody knife.
5623,CANTO SECOND,
5624,CANTO SECOND,--At last one morning--who forgets the day
5625,CANTO SECOND,When the black cloud of war dissolved away
5626,CANTO SECOND,"The joyous tidings spread o'er land and sea,"
5627,CANTO SECOND,Rebellion done for! Grant has captured Lee!
5628,CANTO SECOND,Up every flagstaff sprang the Stars and Stripes--
5629,CANTO SECOND,Out rushed the Extras wild with mammoth types--
5630,CANTO SECOND,"Down went the laborer's hod, the school-boy's book--"
5631,CANTO SECOND,"""Hooraw!"" he cried, ""the rebel army's took!"""
5632,CANTO SECOND,Ah! what a time! the folks all mad with joy
5633,CANTO SECOND,"Each fond, pale mother thinking of her boy;"
5634,CANTO SECOND,"Old gray-haired fathers meeting--""Have--you--heard?"""
5635,CANTO SECOND,And then a choke--and not another word;
5636,CANTO SECOND,"Sisters all smiling--maidens, not less dear,"
5637,CANTO SECOND,In trembling poise between a smile and tear;
5638,CANTO SECOND,Poor Bridget thinking how she 'll stuff the plums
5639,CANTO SECOND,In that big cake for Johnny when he comes;
5640,CANTO SECOND,Cripples afoot; rheumatics on the jump;
5641,CANTO SECOND,Old girls so loving they could hug the pump;
5642,CANTO SECOND,Guns going bang! from every fort and ship;
5643,CANTO SECOND,They banged so loud at last they wakened Rip.
5644,CANTO SECOND,
5645,CANTO SECOND,"I spare the picture, how a man appears"
5646,CANTO SECOND,Who's been asleep a score or two of years;
5647,CANTO SECOND,You all have seen it to perfection done
5648,CANTO SECOND,By Joe Van Wink--I mean Rip Jefferson.
5649,CANTO SECOND,"Well, so it was; old Rip at last came back,"
5650,CANTO SECOND,Claimed his old wife--the present widow Mac----
5651,CANTO SECOND,"Had his old sign regilded, and began"
5652,CANTO SECOND,To practise physic on the same old plan.
5653,CANTO SECOND,Some weeks went by--it was not long to wait--
5654,CANTO SECOND,"And ""please to call"" grew frequent on the slate."
5655,CANTO SECOND,"He had, in fact, an ancient, mildewed air,"
5656,CANTO SECOND,"A long gray beard, a plenteous lack of hair,--"
5657,CANTO SECOND,The musty look that always recommends
5658,CANTO SECOND,Your good old Doctor to his ailing friends.
5659,CANTO SECOND,--Talk of your science! after all is said
5660,CANTO SECOND,There's nothing like a bare and shiny head;
5661,CANTO SECOND,Age lends the graces that are sure to please;
5662,CANTO SECOND,"Folks want their Doctors mouldy, like their cheese."
5663,CANTO SECOND,
5664,CANTO SECOND,So Rip began to look at people's tongues
5665,CANTO SECOND,"And thump their briskets (called it ""sound their lungs""),"
5666,CANTO SECOND,"Brushed up his knowledge smartly as he could,"
5667,CANTO SECOND,Read in old Cullen and in Doctor Good.
5668,CANTO SECOND,The town was healthy; for a month or two
5669,CANTO SECOND,He gave the sexton little work to do.
5670,CANTO SECOND,
5671,CANTO SECOND,"About the time when dog-day heats begin,"
5672,CANTO SECOND,The summer's usual maladies set in;
5673,CANTO SECOND,"With autumn evenings dysentery came,"
5674,CANTO SECOND,And dusky typhoid lit his smouldering flame;
5675,CANTO SECOND,"The blacksmith ailed, the carpenter was down,"
5676,CANTO SECOND,And half the children sickened in the town.
5677,CANTO SECOND,The sexton's face grew shorter than before--
5678,CANTO SECOND,The sexton's wife a brand-new bonnet wore--
5679,CANTO SECOND,Things looked quite serious--Death had got a grip
5680,CANTO SECOND,"On old and young, in spite of Doctor Rip."
5681,CANTO SECOND,
5682,CANTO SECOND,And now the Squire was taken with a chill--
5683,CANTO SECOND,"Wife gave ""hot-drops""--at night an Indian pill;"
5684,CANTO SECOND,"Next morning, feverish--bedtime, getting worse--"
5685,CANTO SECOND,Out of his head--began to rave and curse;
5686,CANTO SECOND,The Doctor sent for--double quick he came
5687,CANTO SECOND,"_Ant. Tart. gran. duo_, and repeat the same"
5688,CANTO SECOND,If no et cetera. Third day--nothing new;
5689,CANTO SECOND,Percussed his thorax till 't was black and blue--
5690,CANTO SECOND,Lung-fever threatening--something of the sort--
5691,CANTO SECOND,Out with the lancet--let him bleed--a quart--
5692,CANTO SECOND,Ten leeches next--then blisters to his side;
5693,CANTO SECOND,Ten grains of calomel; just then he died.
5694,CANTO SECOND,
5695,CANTO SECOND,The Deacon next required the Doctor's care--
5696,CANTO SECOND,Took cold by sitting in a draught of air--
5697,CANTO SECOND,"Pains in the back, but what the matter is"
5698,CANTO SECOND,"Not quite so clear,--wife calls it ""rheumatiz."""
5699,CANTO SECOND,Rubs back with flannel--gives him something hot--
5700,CANTO SECOND,"""Ah!"" says the Deacon, ""that goes nigh the spot."""
5701,CANTO SECOND,"Next day a rigor--""Run, my little man,"
5702,CANTO SECOND,"And say the Deacon sends for Doctor Van."""
5703,CANTO SECOND,"The Doctor came--percussion as before,"
5704,CANTO SECOND,Thumping and banging till his ribs were sore--
5705,CANTO SECOND,"""Right side the flattest""--then more vigorous raps--"
5706,CANTO SECOND,"""Fever--that's certain--pleurisy, perhaps."
5707,CANTO SECOND,"A quart of blood will ease the pain, no doubt,"
5708,CANTO SECOND,"Ten leeches next will help to suck it out,"
5709,CANTO SECOND,Then clap a blister on the painful part--
5710,CANTO SECOND,But first two grains of _Antimonium Tart_.
5711,CANTO SECOND,Last with a dose of cleansing calomel
5712,CANTO SECOND,"Unload the portal system--(that sounds well!)"""
5713,CANTO SECOND,
5714,CANTO SECOND,"But when the selfsame remedies were tried,"
5715,CANTO SECOND,"As all the village knew, the Squire had died;"
5716,CANTO SECOND,
5717,CANTO SECOND,"The neighbors hinted. ""This will never do;"
5718,CANTO SECOND,"He's killed the Squire--he'll kill the Deacon too."""
5719,CANTO SECOND,
5720,CANTO SECOND,"Now when a doctor's patients are perplexed,"
5721,CANTO SECOND,A consultation comes in order next--
5722,CANTO SECOND,You know what that is? In a certain place
5723,CANTO SECOND,Meet certain doctors to discuss a case
5724,CANTO SECOND,"And other matters, such as weather, crops,"
5725,CANTO SECOND,"Potatoes, pumpkins, lager-beer, and hops."
5726,CANTO SECOND,"For what's the use?--there 's little to be said,"
5727,CANTO SECOND,Nine times in ten your man's as good as dead;
5728,CANTO SECOND,At best a talk (the secret to disclose)
5729,CANTO SECOND,Where three men guess and sometimes one man knows.
5730,CANTO SECOND,
5731,CANTO SECOND,The counsel summoned came without delay--
5732,CANTO SECOND,Young Doctor Green and shrewd old Doctor Gray--
5733,CANTO SECOND,"They heard the story--""Bleed!"" says Doctor Green,"
5734,CANTO SECOND,"""That's downright murder! cut his throat, you mean"
5735,CANTO SECOND,"Leeches! the reptiles! Why, for pity's sake,"
5736,CANTO SECOND,Not try an adder or a rattlesnake?
5737,CANTO SECOND,"Blisters! Why bless you, they 're against the law--"
5738,CANTO SECOND,It's rank assault and battery if they draw
5739,CANTO SECOND,"Tartrate of Antimony! shade of Luke,"
5740,CANTO SECOND,Stomachs turn pale at thought of such rebuke!
5741,CANTO SECOND,The portal system! What's the man about?
5742,CANTO SECOND,Unload your nonsense! Calomel's played out!
5743,CANTO SECOND,You've been asleep--you'd better sleep away
5744,CANTO SECOND,"Till some one calls you."""
5745,CANTO SECOND,
5746,CANTO SECOND,"""Stop!"" says Doctor Gray--"
5747,CANTO SECOND,"""The story is you slept for thirty years;"
5748,CANTO SECOND,"With brother Green, I own that it appears"
5749,CANTO SECOND,You must have slumbered most amazing sound;
5750,CANTO SECOND,"But sleep once more till thirty years come round,"
5751,CANTO SECOND,"You'll find the lancet in its honored place,"
5752,CANTO SECOND,"Leeches and blisters rescued from disgrace,"
5753,CANTO SECOND,"Your drugs redeemed from fashion's passing scorn,"
5754,CANTO SECOND,"And counted safe to give to babes unborn."""
5755,CANTO SECOND,
5756,CANTO SECOND,"Poor sleepy Rip, M. M. S. S., M. D.,"
5757,CANTO SECOND,"A puzzled, serious, saddened man was he;"
5758,CANTO SECOND,Home from the Deacon's house he plodded slow
5759,CANTO SECOND,"And filled one bumper of ""Elixir Pro."""
5760,CANTO SECOND,"""Good-by,"" he faltered, ""Mrs. Van, my dear!"
5761,CANTO SECOND,"I'm going to sleep, but wake me once a year;"
5762,CANTO SECOND,"I don't like bleaching in the frost and dew,"
5763,CANTO SECOND,"I'll take the barn, if all the same to you."

5839,AGNES,The story of Sir Harry Frankland and Agnes Surriage is told in the
5840,AGNES,ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts. These were obtained
5841,AGNES,"from information afforded me by the Rev. Mr. Webster, of Hopkinton, in"
5842,AGNES,"company with whom I visited the Frankland Mansion in that town, then"
5843,AGNES,"standing; from a very interesting Memoir, by the Rev. Elias Nason, of"
5844,AGNES,"Medford; and from the manuscript diary of Sir Harry, or more properly"
5845,AGNES,"Sir Charles Henry Frankland, now in the library of the Massachusetts"
5846,AGNES,Historical Society.
5847,AGNES,
5848,AGNES,"At the time of the visit referred to, old Julia was living, and on our"
5849,AGNES,return we called at the house where she resided.--[She was living June
5850,AGNES,"10, 1861, when this ballad was published]--Her account is little more"
5851,AGNES,than paraphrased in the poem. If the incidents are treated with a
5852,AGNES,"certain liberality at the close of the fifth part, the essential fact"
5853,AGNES,"that Agnes rescued Sir Harry from the ruins after the earthquake, and"
5854,AGNES,"their subsequent marriage as related, may be accepted as literal truth."
5855,AGNES,So with regard to most of the trifling details which are given; they are
5856,AGNES,taken from the record. It is greatly to be regretted that the Frankland
5857,AGNES,Mansion no longer exists. It was accidentally burned on the 23d of
5858,AGNES,"January, 1858, a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was"
5859,AGNES,written. A visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the
5860,AGNES,"years before the Revolution. A new house, similar in plan and"
5861,AGNES,"arrangements to the old one, has been built upon its site, and the"
5862,AGNES,"terraces, the clump of box, and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear"
5863,AGNES,witness to the truth of this story.
5864,AGNES,
5865,AGNES,"The story, which I have told literally in rhyme, has been made"
5866,AGNES,the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by Mr.
5867,AGNES,E. L. Bynner.

6694,SPRING,WINTER is past; the heart of Nature warms
6695,SPRING,Beneath the wrecks of unresisted storms;
6696,SPRING,"Doubtful at first, suspected more than seen,"
6697,SPRING,The southern slopes are fringed with tender green;
6698,SPRING,"On sheltered banks, beneath the dripping eaves,"
6699,SPRING,"Spring's earliest nurslings spread their glowing leaves,"
6700,SPRING,"Bright with the hues from wider pictures won,"
6701,SPRING,"White, azure, golden,--drift, or sky, or sun,--"
6702,SPRING,"The snowdrop, bearing on her patient breast"
6703,SPRING,The frozen trophy torn from Winter's crest;
6704,SPRING,"The violet, gazing on the arch of blue"
6705,SPRING,Till her own iris wears its deepened hue;
6706,SPRING,"The spendthrift crocus, bursting through the mould"
6707,SPRING,Naked and shivering with his cup of gold.
6708,SPRING,"Swelled with new life, the darkening elm on high"
6709,SPRING,Prints her thick buds against the spotted sky
6710,SPRING,On all her boughs the stately chestnut cleaves
6711,SPRING,The gummy shroud that wraps her embryo leaves;
6712,SPRING,"The house-fly, stealing from his narrow grave,"
6713,SPRING,"Drugged with the opiate that November gave,"
6714,SPRING,"Beats with faint wing against the sunny pane,"
6715,SPRING,"Or crawls, tenacious, o'er its lucid plain;"
6716,SPRING,"From shaded chinks of lichen-crusted walls,"
6717,SPRING,"In languid curves, the gliding serpent crawls;"
6718,SPRING,"The bog's green harper, thawing from his sleep,"

6721,SPRING,"The still shy turtles range their dark platoons,"
6722,SPRING,"Or, toiling aimless o'er the mellowing fields,"

6725,SPRING,"At last young April, ever frail and fair,"
6726,SPRING,"Wooed by her playmate with the golden hair,"
6727,SPRING,Chased to the margin of receding floods
6728,SPRING,"O'er the soft meadows starred with opening buds,"
6729,SPRING,"In tears and blushes sighs herself away,"
6730,SPRING,And hides her cheek beneath the flowers of May.
6731,SPRING,
6732,SPRING,"Then the proud tulip lights her beacon blaze,"

6740,SPRING,"Her snowy shoulders glistening as she strips,"
6741,SPRING,Till morn is sultan of her parted lips.
6742,SPRING,
6743,SPRING,"Then bursts the song from every leafy glade,"
6744,SPRING,The yielding season's bridal serenade;
6745,SPRING,Then flash the wings returning Summer calls
6746,SPRING,"Through the deep arches of her forest halls,--"
6747,SPRING,"The bluebird, breathing from his azure plumes"
6748,SPRING,The fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms;
6749,SPRING,"The thrush, poor wanderer, dropping meekly down,"
6750,SPRING,Clad in his remnant of autumnal brown;
6751,SPRING,"The oriole, drifting like a flake of fire"
6752,SPRING,Rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire.
6753,SPRING,"The robin, jerking his spasmodic throat,"
6754,SPRING,"Repeats, imperious, his staccato note;"
6755,SPRING,"The crack-brained bobolink courts his crazy mate,"
6756,SPRING,Poised on a bulrush tipsy with his weight;
6757,SPRING,"Nay, in his cage the lone canary sings,"
6758,SPRING,"Feels the soft air, and spreads his idle wings."
6759,SPRING,
6760,SPRING,"Why dream I here within these caging walls,"
6761,SPRING,"Deaf to her voice, while blooming Nature calls;"
6762,SPRING,Peering and gazing with insatiate looks
6763,SPRING,"Through blinding lenses, or in wearying books?"
6764,SPRING,"Off, gloomy spectres of the shrivelled past!"
6765,SPRING,Fly with the leaves that fill the autumn blast
6766,SPRING,"Ye imps of Science, whose relentless chains"
6767,SPRING,"Lock the warm tides within these living veins,"
6768,SPRING,"Close your dim cavern, while its captive strays"

7071,THE OLD PLAYER,THE curtain rose; in thunders long and loud
7072,THE OLD PLAYER,The galleries rung; the veteran actor bowed.
7073,THE OLD PLAYER,In flaming line the telltales of the stage
7074,THE OLD PLAYER,Showed on his brow the autograph of age;
7075,THE OLD PLAYER,"Pale, hueless waves amid his clustered hair,"
7076,THE OLD PLAYER,"And umbered shadows, prints of toil and care;"
7077,THE OLD PLAYER,"Round the wide circle glanced his vacant eye,--"
7078,THE OLD PLAYER,"He strove to speak,--his voice was but a sigh."
7079,THE OLD PLAYER,
7080,THE OLD PLAYER,Year after year had seen its short-lived race
7081,THE OLD PLAYER,Flit past the scenes and others take their place;
7082,THE OLD PLAYER,"Yet the old prompter watched his accents still,"
7083,THE OLD PLAYER,His name still flaunted on the evening's bill.
7084,THE OLD PLAYER,"Heroes, the monarchs of the scenic floor,"
7085,THE OLD PLAYER,Had died in earnest and were heard no more;
7086,THE OLD PLAYER,"Beauties, whose cheeks such roseate bloom o'er-spread"
7087,THE OLD PLAYER,"They faced the footlights in unborrowed red,"
7088,THE OLD PLAYER,Had faded slowly through successive shades
7089,THE OLD PLAYER,"To gray duennas, foils of younger maids;"
7090,THE OLD PLAYER,Sweet voices lost the melting tones that start
7091,THE OLD PLAYER,"With Southern throbs the sturdy Saxon heart,"
7092,THE OLD PLAYER,While fresh sopranos shook the painted sky
7093,THE OLD PLAYER,"With their long, breathless, quivering locust-cry."
7094,THE OLD PLAYER,"Yet there he stood,--the man of other days,"
7095,THE OLD PLAYER,"In the clear present's full, unsparing blaze,"
7096,THE OLD PLAYER,As on the oak a faded leaf that clings
7097,THE OLD PLAYER,While a new April spreads its burnished wings.
7098,THE OLD PLAYER,
7099,THE OLD PLAYER,"How bright yon rows that soared in triple tier,"
7100,THE OLD PLAYER,Their central sun the flashing chandelier!
7101,THE OLD PLAYER,How dim the eye that sought with doubtful aim
7102,THE OLD PLAYER,Some friendly smile it still might dare to claim
7103,THE OLD PLAYER,How fresh these hearts! his own how worn and cold!
7104,THE OLD PLAYER,Such the sad thoughts that long-drawn sigh had told.
7105,THE OLD PLAYER,No word yet faltered on his trembling tongue;
7106,THE OLD PLAYER,"Again, again, the crashing galleries rung."
7107,THE OLD PLAYER,As the old guardsman at the bugle's blast
7108,THE OLD PLAYER,"Hears in its strain the echoes of the past,"
7109,THE OLD PLAYER,"So, as the plaudits rolled and thundered round,"
7110,THE OLD PLAYER,A life of memories startled at the sound.
7111,THE OLD PLAYER,"He lived again,--the page of earliest days,--"
7112,THE OLD PLAYER,Days of small fee and parsimonious praise;
7113,THE OLD PLAYER,"Then lithe young Romeo--hark that silvered tone,"
7114,THE OLD PLAYER,From those smooth lips--alas! they were his own.
7115,THE OLD PLAYER,"Then the bronzed Moor, with all his love and woe,"
7116,THE OLD PLAYER,Told his strange tale of midnight melting snow;
7117,THE OLD PLAYER,"And dark--plumed Hamlet, with his cloak and blade,"
7118,THE OLD PLAYER,"Looked on the royal ghost, himself a shade."
7119,THE OLD PLAYER,"All in one flash, his youthful memories came,"
7120,THE OLD PLAYER,"Traced in bright hues of evanescent flame,"
7121,THE OLD PLAYER,"As the spent swimmer's in the lifelong dream,"
7122,THE OLD PLAYER,While the last bubble rises through the stream.
7123,THE OLD PLAYER,
7124,THE OLD PLAYER,"Call him not old, whose visionary brain"
7125,THE OLD PLAYER,Holds o'er the past its undivided reign.
7126,THE OLD PLAYER,For him in vain the envious seasons roll
7127,THE OLD PLAYER,Who bears eternal summer in his soul.
7128,THE OLD PLAYER,"If yet the minstrel's song, the poet's lay,"
7129,THE OLD PLAYER,"Spring with her birds, or children at their play,"
7130,THE OLD PLAYER,"Or maiden's smile, or heavenly dream of art,"
7131,THE OLD PLAYER,"Stir the few life-drops creeping round his heart,"
7132,THE OLD PLAYER,"Turn to the record where his years are told,--"
7133,THE OLD PLAYER,"Count his gray hairs,--they cannot make him old!"
7134,THE OLD PLAYER,What magic power has changed the faded mime?
7135,THE OLD PLAYER,One breath of memory on the dust of time.
7136,THE OLD PLAYER,As the last window in the buttressed wall
7137,THE OLD PLAYER,"Of some gray minster tottering to its fall,"
7138,THE OLD PLAYER,"Though to the passing crowd its hues are spread,"
7139,THE OLD PLAYER,"A dull mosaic, yellow, green, and red,"
7140,THE OLD PLAYER,"Viewed from within, a radiant glory shows"
7141,THE OLD PLAYER,"When through its pictured screen the sunlight flows,"
7142,THE OLD PLAYER,And kneeling pilgrims on its storied pane
7143,THE OLD PLAYER,See angels glow in every shapeless stain;
7144,THE OLD PLAYER,"So streamed the vision through his sunken eye,"
7145,THE OLD PLAYER,Clad in the splendors of his morning sky.
7146,THE OLD PLAYER,"All the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew,"
7147,THE OLD PLAYER,"All the young fancies riper years proved true,"
7148,THE OLD PLAYER,"The sweet, low-whispered words, the winning glance"
7149,THE OLD PLAYER,"From queens of song, from Houris of the dance,"
7150,THE OLD PLAYER,"Wealth's lavish gift, and Flattery's soothing phrase,"
7151,THE OLD PLAYER,"And Beauty's silence when her blush was praise,"
7152,THE OLD PLAYER,"And melting Pride, her lashes wet with tears,"
7153,THE OLD PLAYER,"Triumphs and banquets, wreaths and crowns and cheers,"
7154,THE OLD PLAYER,"Pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue,"
7155,THE OLD PLAYER,"And all that poets dream, but leave unsung!"
7156,THE OLD PLAYER,
7157,THE OLD PLAYER,In every heart some viewless founts are fed
7158,THE OLD PLAYER,From far-off hillsides where the dews were shed;
7159,THE OLD PLAYER,On the worn features of the weariest face
7160,THE OLD PLAYER,"Some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace,"
7161,THE OLD PLAYER,As in old gardens left by exiled kings
7162,THE OLD PLAYER,"The marble basins tell of hidden springs,"
7163,THE OLD PLAYER,"But, gray with dust, and overgrown with weeds,"
7164,THE OLD PLAYER,"Their choking jets the passer little heeds,"
7165,THE OLD PLAYER,"Till time's revenges break their seals away,"
7166,THE OLD PLAYER,"And, clad in rainbow light, the waters play."
7167,THE OLD PLAYER,
7168,THE OLD PLAYER,"Good night, fond dreamer! let the curtain fall"
7169,THE OLD PLAYER,"The world's a stage, and we are players all."
7170,THE OLD PLAYER,"A strange rehearsal! Kings without their crowns,"
7171,THE OLD PLAYER,"And threadbare lords, and jewel-wearing clowns,"
7172,THE OLD PLAYER,"Speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts,"
7173,THE OLD PLAYER,"As Want, stern prompter! spells them out their parts."
7174,THE OLD PLAYER,The tinselled hero whom we praise and pay
7175,THE OLD PLAYER,Is twice an actor in a twofold play.
7176,THE OLD PLAYER,We smile at children when a painted screen
7177,THE OLD PLAYER,Seems to their simple eyes a real scene;
7178,THE OLD PLAYER,"Ask the poor hireling, who has left his throne"
7179,THE OLD PLAYER,"To seek the cheerless home he calls his own,"
7180,THE OLD PLAYER,"Which of his double lives most real seems,"
7181,THE OLD PLAYER,The world of solid fact or scenic dreams?
7182,THE OLD PLAYER,"Canvas, or clouds,--the footlights, or the spheres,--"
7183,THE OLD PLAYER,"The play of two short hours, or seventy years?"
7184,THE OLD PLAYER,"Dream on! Though Heaven may woo our open eyes,"
7185,THE OLD PLAYER,Through their closed lids we look on fairer skies;
7186,THE OLD PLAYER,"Truth is for other worlds, and hope for this;"
7187,THE OLD PLAYER,The cheating future lends the present's bliss;
7188,THE OLD PLAYER,"Life is a running shade, with fettered hands,"
7189,THE OLD PLAYER,That chases phantoms over shifting sands;
7190,THE OLD PLAYER,"Death a still spectre on a marble seat,"
7191,THE OLD PLAYER,With ever clutching palms and shackled feet;
7192,THE OLD PLAYER,"The airy shapes that mock life's slender chain,"
7193,THE OLD PLAYER,"The flying joys he strives to clasp in vain,"
7194,THE OLD PLAYER,"Death only grasps; to live is to pursue,--"
7195,THE OLD PLAYER,Dream on! there 's nothing but illusion true!

7229,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The green-haired maize, her silken tresses laid,"
7230,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","In soft luxuriance, on her harsh brocade;"
7231,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume;

7233,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Its coral stems and milk-white flowers alive
7234,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",With the wide murmurs of the scattered hive;

7237,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The pear's long necklace strung with golden drops,"
7238,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Arched, like the banian, o'er its pillared props;"

7262,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Through the red lips of June's half-open rose,"
7263,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Dressed in bright hues, the loving sunshine's dower;"

7321,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The pride of beauty stricken in its flower;
7322,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",The strength of manhood broken in an hour;
7323,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Age in its weakness, bowed by toil and care,"
7324,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",Traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair.
7325,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850",
7326,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","The sun shall set, and heaven's resplendent spheres"
7327,"SEPTEMBER 9,1850","Gild the smooth turf unhallowed yet by tears,"

8436,AVIS,"With the lost children running wild,"
8437,AVIS,"Strayed from the hand of human care,"
8438,AVIS,They find one little refuse child
8439,AVIS,Left helpless in its poisoned lair.
8440,AVIS,
8441,AVIS,"The primal mark is on her face,--"
8442,AVIS,"The chattel-stamp,--the pariah-stain"
8443,AVIS,"That follows still her hunted race,--"
8444,AVIS,The curse without the crime of Cain.
8445,AVIS,
8446,AVIS,How shall our smooth-turned phrase relate
8447,AVIS,The little suffering outcast's ail?
8448,AVIS,Not Lazarus at the rich man's gate
8449,AVIS,So turned the rose-wreathed revellers pale.
8450,AVIS,
8451,AVIS,"Ah, veil the living death from sight"
8452,AVIS,That wounds our beauty-loving eye!
8453,AVIS,"The children turn in selfish fright,"
8454,AVIS,The white-lipped nurses hurry by.
8455,AVIS,
8456,AVIS,"Take her, dread Angel! Break in love"
8457,AVIS,This bruised reed and make it thine!--
8458,AVIS,"No voice descended from above,"
8459,AVIS,"But Avis answered, ""She is mine."""
8460,AVIS,
8461,AVIS,The task that dainty menials spurn
8462,AVIS,The fair young girl has made her own;
8463,AVIS,"Her heart shall teach, her hand shall learn"
8464,AVIS,"The toils, the duties yet unknown."
8465,AVIS,
8466,AVIS,So Love and Death in lingering strife
8467,AVIS,"Stand face to face from day to day,"
8468,AVIS,Still battling for the spoil of Life
8469,AVIS,While the slow seasons creep away.
8470,AVIS,
8471,AVIS,Love conquers Death; the prize is won;
8472,AVIS,See to her joyous bosom pressed
8473,AVIS,"The dusky daughter of the sun,--"
8474,AVIS,The bronze against the marble breast!
8475,AVIS,
8476,AVIS,Her task is done; no voice divine
8477,AVIS,Has crowned her deeds with saintly fame.
8478,AVIS,No eye can see the aureole shine
8479,AVIS,That rings her brow with heavenly flame.
8480,AVIS,
8481,AVIS,"Yet what has holy page more sweet,"
8482,AVIS,"Or what had woman's love more fair,"
8483,AVIS,When Mary clasped her Saviour's feet
8484,AVIS,With flowing eyes and streaming hair?
8485,AVIS,
8486,AVIS,"Meek child of sorrow, walk unknown,"
8487,AVIS,"The Angel of that earthly throng,"
8488,AVIS,And let thine image live alone
8489,AVIS,To hallow this unstudied song!

10748,OUR OLDEST FRIEND,And held our hands till we stood upright.

10750,OUR OLDEST FRIEND,From gristle and pulp our frames have grown

11329,EVEN-SONG.,"And bid him sing no more!"""
11330,EVEN-SONG.,
11331,EVEN-SONG.,"Ah, welladay! if words so cruel-kind"
11332,EVEN-SONG.,A listening ear might find!
11333,EVEN-SONG.,But who that hears the music in his soul
11334,EVEN-SONG.,Of rhythmic waves that roll
11335,EVEN-SONG.,"Crested with gleams of fire, and as they flow"
11336,EVEN-SONG.,Stir all the deeps below
11337,EVEN-SONG.,Till the great pearls no calm might ever reach
11338,EVEN-SONG.,"Leap glistening on the beach,--"
11339,EVEN-SONG.,"Who that has known the passion and the pain,"
11340,EVEN-SONG.,"The rush through heart and brain,"
11341,EVEN-SONG.,The joy so like a pang his hand is pressed
11342,EVEN-SONG.,"Hard on his throbbing breast,"
11343,EVEN-SONG.,"When thou, whose smile is life and bliss and fame"
11344,EVEN-SONG.,"Hast set his pulse aflame,"
11345,EVEN-SONG.,Muse of the lyre! can say farewell to thee?
11346,EVEN-SONG.,Alas! and must it be?
11347,EVEN-SONG.,
11348,EVEN-SONG.,"In many a clime, in many a stately tongue,"
11349,EVEN-SONG.,The mighty bards have sung;
11350,EVEN-SONG.,To these the immemorial thrones belong
11351,EVEN-SONG.,And purple robes of song;
11352,EVEN-SONG.,Yet the slight minstrel loves the slender tone
11353,EVEN-SONG.,"His lips may call his own,"
11354,EVEN-SONG.,"And finds the measure of the verse more sweet,"
11355,EVEN-SONG.,"Timed by his pulse's beat,"
11356,EVEN-SONG.,Than all the hymnings of the laurelled throng.
11357,EVEN-SONG.,"Say not I do him wrong,"
11358,EVEN-SONG.,"For Nature spoils her warblers,--them she feeds"
11359,EVEN-SONG.,In lotus-growing meads
11360,EVEN-SONG.,And pours them subtle draughts from haunted streams
11361,EVEN-SONG.,That fill their souls with dreams.
11362,EVEN-SONG.,
11363,EVEN-SONG.,Full well I know the gracious mother's wiles
11364,EVEN-SONG.,And dear delusive smiles!
11365,EVEN-SONG.,No callow fledgling of her singing brood
11366,EVEN-SONG.,"But tastes that witching food,"
11367,EVEN-SONG.,"And hearing overhead the eagle's wing,"
11368,EVEN-SONG.,"And how the thrushes sing,"
11369,EVEN-SONG.,"Vents his exiguous chirp, and from his nest"
11370,EVEN-SONG.,Flaps forth--we know the rest.
11371,EVEN-SONG.,"I own the weakness of the tuneful kind,--"
11372,EVEN-SONG.,Are not all harpers blind?
11373,EVEN-SONG.,"I sang too early, must I sing too late?"
11374,EVEN-SONG.,The lengthening shadows wait
11375,EVEN-SONG.,"The first pale stars of twilight,--yet how sweet"
11376,EVEN-SONG.,"The flattering whisper's cheat,--"
11377,EVEN-SONG.,"""Thou hast the fire no evening chill can tame,"
11378,EVEN-SONG.,"Whose coals outlast its flame!"""
11379,EVEN-SONG.,
11380,EVEN-SONG.,"Farewell, ye carols of the laughing morn,"
11381,EVEN-SONG.,Of earliest sunshine born!
11382,EVEN-SONG.,The sower flings the seed and looks not back
11383,EVEN-SONG.,Along his furrowed track;
11384,EVEN-SONG.,The reaper leaves the stalks for other hands
11385,EVEN-SONG.,To gird with circling bands;
11386,EVEN-SONG.,"The wind, earth's careless servant, truant-born,"
11387,EVEN-SONG.,Blows clean the beaten corn
11388,EVEN-SONG.,"And quits the thresher's floor, and goes his way"
11389,EVEN-SONG.,To sport with ocean's spray;
11390,EVEN-SONG.,The headlong-stumbling rivulet scrambling down
11391,EVEN-SONG.,"To wash the sea-girt town,"
11392,EVEN-SONG.,Still babbling of the green and billowy waste
11393,EVEN-SONG.,"Whose salt he longs to taste,"
11394,EVEN-SONG.,Ere his warm wave its chilling clasp may feel
11395,EVEN-SONG.,Has twirled the miller's wheel.
11396,EVEN-SONG.,
11397,EVEN-SONG.,The song has done its task that makes us bold
11398,EVEN-SONG.,"With secrets else untold,--"
11399,EVEN-SONG.,And mine has run its errand; through the dews
11400,EVEN-SONG.,I tracked the flying Muse;
11401,EVEN-SONG.,The daughter of the morning touched my lips
11402,EVEN-SONG.,With roseate finger-tips;
11403,EVEN-SONG.,"Whether I would or would not, I must sing"
11404,EVEN-SONG.,With the new choirs of spring;
11405,EVEN-SONG.,"Now, as I watch the fading autumn day"
11406,EVEN-SONG.,"And trill my softened lay,"
11407,EVEN-SONG.,"I think of all that listened, and of one"
11408,EVEN-SONG.,For whom a brighter sun
11409,EVEN-SONG.,"Dawned at high summer's noon. Ah, comrades dear,"
11410,EVEN-SONG.,Are not all gathered here?
11411,EVEN-SONG.,Our hearts have answered.--Yes! they hear our call:
11412,EVEN-SONG.,All gathered here! all! all!
11413,EVEN-SONG.,
11414,EVEN-SONG.,

11418,THE SMILING LISTENER,THE SMILING LISTENER
11419,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11420,THE SMILING LISTENER,1871
11421,THE SMILING LISTENER,PRECISELY. I see it. You all want to say
11422,THE SMILING LISTENER,That a tear is too sad and a laugh is too gay;
11423,THE SMILING LISTENER,"You could stand a faint smile, you could manage a sigh,"
11424,THE SMILING LISTENER,"But you value your ribs, and you don't want to cry."
11425,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11426,THE SMILING LISTENER,And why at our feast of the clasping of hands
11427,THE SMILING LISTENER,Need we turn on the stream of our lachrymal glands?
11428,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Though we see the white breakers of age on our bow,"
11429,THE SMILING LISTENER,Let us take a good pull in the jolly-boat now!
11430,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11431,THE SMILING LISTENER,It's hard if a fellow cannot feel content
11432,THE SMILING LISTENER,"When a banquet like this does n't cost him a cent,"
11433,THE SMILING LISTENER,"When his goblet and plate he may empty at will,"
11434,THE SMILING LISTENER,And our kind Class Committee will settle the bill.
11435,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11436,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And here's your old friend, the identical bard"
11437,THE SMILING LISTENER,Who has rhymed and recited you verse by the yard
11438,THE SMILING LISTENER,Since the days of the empire of Andrew the First
11439,THE SMILING LISTENER,Till you 're full to the brim and feel ready to burst.
11440,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11441,THE SMILING LISTENER,"It's awful to think of,--how year after year"
11442,THE SMILING LISTENER,With his piece in his pocket he waits for you here;
11443,THE SMILING LISTENER,"No matter who's missing, there always is one"
11444,THE SMILING LISTENER,"To lug out his manuscript, sure as a gun."
11445,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11446,THE SMILING LISTENER,"""Why won't he stop writing?"" Humanity cries"
11447,THE SMILING LISTENER,"The answer is briefly, ""He can't if he tries;"
11448,THE SMILING LISTENER,"He has played with his foolish old feather so long,"
11449,THE SMILING LISTENER,"That the goose-quill in spite of him cackles in song."""
11450,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11451,THE SMILING LISTENER,You have watched him with patience from morning to dusk
11452,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Since the tassel was bright o'er the green of the husk,"
11453,THE SMILING LISTENER,And now--it 's too bad--it 's a pitiful job--
11454,THE SMILING LISTENER,He has shelled the ripe ear till he's come to the cob.
11455,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11456,THE SMILING LISTENER,I see one face beaming--it listens so well
11457,THE SMILING LISTENER,There must be some music yet left in my shell--
11458,THE SMILING LISTENER,The wine of my soul is not thick on the lees;
11459,THE SMILING LISTENER,"One string is unbroken, one friend I can please!"
11460,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11461,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Dear comrade, the sunshine of seasons gone by"
11462,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Looks out from your tender and tear-moistened eye,"
11463,THE SMILING LISTENER,"A pharos of love on an ice-girdled coast,--"
11464,THE SMILING LISTENER,Kind soul!--Don't you hear me?--He's deaf as a post!
11465,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11466,THE SMILING LISTENER,Can it be one of Nature's benevolent tricks
11467,THE SMILING LISTENER,That you grow hard of hearing as I grow prolix?
11468,THE SMILING LISTENER,And that look of delight which would angels beguile
11469,THE SMILING LISTENER,Is the deaf man's prolonged unintelligent smile?
11470,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11471,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Ah! the ear may grow dull, and the eye may wax dim,"
11472,THE SMILING LISTENER,But they still know a classmate--they can't mistake him;
11473,THE SMILING LISTENER,"There is something to tell us, ""That's one of our band,"""
11474,THE SMILING LISTENER,Though we groped in the dark for a touch of his hand.
11475,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11476,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Well, Time with his snuffers is prowling about"
11477,THE SMILING LISTENER,And his shaky old fingers will soon snuff us out;
11478,THE SMILING LISTENER,"There's a hint for us all in each pendulum tick,"
11479,THE SMILING LISTENER,For we're low in the tallow and long in the wick.
11480,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11481,THE SMILING LISTENER,You remember Rossini--you 've been at the play?
11482,THE SMILING LISTENER,How his overture-endings keep crashing away
11483,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Till you think, ""It 's all over--it can't but stop now--"
11484,THE SMILING LISTENER,"That 's the screech and the bang of the final bow-wow."""
11485,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11486,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And you find you 're mistaken; there 's lots more to come,"
11487,THE SMILING LISTENER,"More banging, more screeching of fiddle and drum,"
11488,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Till when the last ending is finished and done,"
11489,THE SMILING LISTENER,You feel like a horse when the winning-post 's won.
11490,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11491,THE SMILING LISTENER,"So I, who have sung to you, merry or sad,"
11492,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Since the days when they called me a promising lad,"
11493,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Though I 've made you more rhymes than a tutor could scan,"
11494,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Have a few more still left, like the razor-strop man."
11495,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11496,THE SMILING LISTENER,Now pray don't be frightened--I 'm ready to stop
11497,THE SMILING LISTENER,My galloping anapests' clatter and pop--
11498,THE SMILING LISTENER,"In fact, if you say so, retire from to-day"
11499,THE SMILING LISTENER,"To the garret I left, on a poet's half-pay."
11500,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11501,THE SMILING LISTENER,And yet--I can't help it--perhaps--who can tell?
11502,THE SMILING LISTENER,"You might miss the poor singer you treated so well,"
11503,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And confess you could stand him five minutes or so,"
11504,THE SMILING LISTENER,"""It was so like old times we remember, you know."""
11505,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11506,THE SMILING LISTENER,"'T is not that the music can signify much,"
11507,THE SMILING LISTENER,"But then there are chords that awake with a touch,--"
11508,THE SMILING LISTENER,And our hearts can find echoes of sorrow and joy
11509,THE SMILING LISTENER,To the winch of the minstrel who hails from Savoy.
11510,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11511,THE SMILING LISTENER,So this hand-organ tune that I cheerfully grind
11512,THE SMILING LISTENER,"May bring the old places and faces to mind,"
11513,THE SMILING LISTENER,And seen in the light of the past we recall
11514,THE SMILING LISTENER,The flowers that have faded bloom fairest of all!
11515,THE SMILING LISTENER,
11516,THE SMILING LISTENER,

11523,J. A.,
11524,J. A.,1872
11525,J. A.,
11526,J. A.,ONE memory trembles on our lips;
11527,J. A.,It throbs in every breast;
11528,J. A.,"In tear-dimmed eyes, in mirth's eclipse,"
11529,J. A.,The shadow stands confessed.
11530,J. A.,
11531,J. A.,"O silent voice, that cheered so long"
11532,J. A.,"Our manhood's marching day,"
11533,J. A.,"Without thy breath of heavenly song,"
11534,J. A.,How weary seems the way!
11535,J. A.,
11536,J. A.,Vain every pictured phrase to tell
11537,J. A.,"Our sorrowing heart's desire,--"
11538,J. A.,"The shattered harp, the broken shell,"
11539,J. A.,The silent unstrung lyre;
11540,J. A.,
11541,J. A.,For youth was round us while he sang;
11542,J. A.,It glowed in every tone;
11543,J. A.,"With bridal chimes the echoes rang,"
11544,J. A.,And made the past our own.
11545,J. A.,
11546,J. A.,Oh blissful dream! Our nursery joys
11547,J. A.,"We know must have an end,"
11548,J. A.,But love and friendship's broken toys
11549,J. A.,May God's good angels mend!
11550,J. A.,
11551,J. A.,"The cheering smile, the voice of mirth"
11552,J. A.,And laughter's gay surprise
11553,J. A.,That please the children born of earth.
11554,J. A.,Why deem that Heaven denies?
11555,J. A.,
11556,J. A.,Methinks in that refulgent sphere
11557,J. A.,"That knows not sun or moon,"
11558,J. A.,An earth-born saint might long to hear
11559,J. A.,"One verse of ""Bonny Doon"";"
11560,J. A.,
11561,J. A.,Or walking through the streets of gold
11562,J. A.,"In heaven's unclouded light,"
11563,J. A.,His lips recall the song of old
11564,J. A.,"And hum ""The sky is bright."""
11565,J. A.,
11566,J. A.,And can we smile when thou art dead?
11567,J. A.,"Ah, brothers, even so!"
11568,J. A.,"The rose of summer will be red,"
11569,J. A.,In spite of winter's snow.
11570,J. A.,
11571,J. A.,Thou wouldst not leave us all in gloom
11572,J. A.,"Because thy song is still,"
11573,J. A.,Nor blight the banquet-garland's bloom
11574,J. A.,With grief's untimely chill.
11575,J. A.,
11576,J. A.,"The sighing wintry winds complain,--"
11577,J. A.,"The singing bird has flown,--"
11578,J. A.,"Hark! heard I not that ringing strain,"
11579,J. A.,That clear celestial tone?
11580,J. A.,
11581,J. A.,"How poor these pallid phrases seem,"
11582,J. A.,"How weak this tinkling line,"
11583,J. A.,As warbles through my waking dream
11584,J. A.,That angel voice of thine!
11585,J. A.,
11586,J. A.,Thy requiem asks a sweeter lay;
11587,J. A.,It falters on my tongue;
11588,J. A.,"For all we vainly strive to say,"
11589,J. A.,Thou shouldst thyself have sung!

11600,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,The sad-voiced requiem sung;
11601,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,On each white urn where memory dwells
11602,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,The wreath of rustling immortelles
11603,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Our loving hands have hung,"
11604,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,And balmiest leaves have strown and tenderest blossoms flung.

11606,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"The birds that filled the air with songs have flown,"

11617,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,With sorrowing hearts resign
11618,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Our brothers true and tried, and close our broken line."
11619,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,
11620,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,How fast the lamps of life grow dim and die
11621,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Beneath our sunset sky!
11622,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Still fading, as along our track"
11623,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"We cast our saddened glances back,"

11626,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,
11627,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,As when from pier to pier across the tide

11629,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,The lights we left along the shore
11630,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Grow less and less, while more, yet more"
11631,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,New vistas open wide
11632,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Of fair illumined streets and casements golden-eyed.

11634,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Each closing circle of our sunlit sphere
11635,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Seems to bring heaven more near

11640,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,
11641,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Does all that made us human fade away
11642,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,With this dissolving clay?
11643,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Nay, rather deem the blessed isles"
11644,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Are bright and gay with joyous smiles,"
11645,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"That angels have their play,"
11646,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,And saints that tire of song may claim their holiday.
11647,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,
11648,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,All else of earth may perish; love alone
11649,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Not heaven shall find outgrown!
11650,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,"Are they not here, our spirit guests,"
11651,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,With love still throbbing in their breasts?
11652,H. C. M. H. S. J. K. W.,Once more let flowers be strown.

11664,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,It is not the first time I have tried on the same.
11665,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,"They were puckered in rhyme, they were wrinkled in wit;"
11666,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,But your hearts were so large that they made them a fit.
11667,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,
11668,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,"I have come--not to tease you with more of my rhyme,"
11669,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,But to feel as I did in the blessed old time;
11670,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,I want to hear him with the Brobdingnag laugh--
11671,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,We count him at least as three men and a half.
11672,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,
11673,WHAT I HAVE COME FOR,I have come to meet judges so wise and so grand

12723,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,THIS shred of song you bid me bring
12724,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Is snatched from fancy's embers;
12725,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"Ah, when the lips forget to sing,"
12726,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,The faithful heart remembers!
12727,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12728,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Too swift the wings of envious Time
12729,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"To wait for dallying phrases,"
12730,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Or woven strands of labored rhyme
12731,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,To thread their cunning mazes.
12732,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12733,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"A word, a sigh, and lo, how plain"
12734,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Its magic breath discloses
12735,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Our life's long vista through a lane
12736,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Of threescore summers' roses!
12737,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12738,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,One language years alone can teach
12739,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Its roots are young affections
12740,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That feel their way to simplest speech
12741,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Through silent recollections.
12742,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12743,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That tongue is ours. How few the words
12744,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,We need to know a brother!
12745,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"As simple are the notes of birds,"
12746,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Yet well they know each other.
12747,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12748,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,This freezing month of ice and snow
12749,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That brings our lives together
12750,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Lends to our year a living glow
12751,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That warms its wintry weather.
12752,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
12753,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"So let us meet as eve draws nigh,"
12754,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"And life matures and mellows,"
12755,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"Till Nature whispers with a sigh,"

12767,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The waste that careless Nature owns;
12768,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Lone tenants of her bleak domain,"
12769,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Loomed huge and gray the Druid stones.
12770,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12771,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Upheaved in many a billowy mound
12772,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"The sea-like, naked turf arose,"
12773,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Where wandering flocks went nibbling round
12774,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The mingled graves of friends and foes.
12775,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12776,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"The Briton, Roman, Saxon, Dane,"
12777,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,This windy desert roamed in turn;
12778,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Unmoved these mighty blocks remain
12779,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Whose story none that lives may learn.
12780,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12781,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Erect, half buried, slant or prone,"
12782,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"These awful listeners, blind and dumb,"
12783,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Hear the strange tongues of tribes unknown,"
12784,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,As wave on wave they go and come.
12785,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12786,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""Who are you, giants, whence and why?"""
12787,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,I stand and ask in blank amaze;

12791,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""A silent Orpheus wrought the charm"
12792,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,From riven rocks their spoils to bring;
12793,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,A nameless Titan lent his arm
12794,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,To range us in our magic ring.
12795,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12796,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""But Time with still and stealthy stride,"
12797,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"That climbs and treads and levels all,"

12800,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12801,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""Time, that unbuilds the quarried past,"
12802,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Leans on these wrecks that press the sod;
12803,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"They slant, they stoop, they fall at last,"
12804,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,And strew the turf their priests have trod.
12805,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12806,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""No more our altar's wreath of smoke"
12807,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Floats up with morning's fragrant dew;

12810,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12811,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"My thoughts had wandered far away,"
12812,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Borne off on Memory's outspread wing,"
12813,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,To where in deepening twilight lay
12814,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The wrecks of friendship's broken ring.
12815,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12816,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Ah me! of all our goodly train
12817,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,How few will find our banquet hall!
12818,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Yet why with coward lips complain
12819,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"That this must lean, and that must fall?"
12820,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12821,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Cold is the Druid's altar-stone,"
12822,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Its vanished flame no more returns;
12823,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"But ours no chilling damp has known,--"
12824,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Unchanged, unchanging, still it burns."
12825,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
12826,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,So let our broken circle stand
12827,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"A wreck, a remnant, yet the same,"

13083,MUSA,On the green ripples round yon sunken piles
13084,MUSA,"Washed by the moon-wave warm from Indian isles,"
13085,MUSA,And on the sultry air

13350,PROLOGUE,"""Why strikest not? Perform thy murderous act,"""
13351,PROLOGUE,The prisoner said. (His voice was slightly cracked.)

13774,A LOGICAL STORY,That was for spokes and floor and sills;

13801,A LOGICAL STORY,EIGHTEEN HUNDRED;--it came and found

13872,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,At Cambridge. Is kept in the College there.
13873,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Seems but little the worse for wear.
13874,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That 's remarkable when I say
13875,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,It was old in President Holyoke's day.
13876,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"(One of his boys, perhaps you know,"
13877,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Died, _at one hundred_, years ago.)"
13878,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,He took lodgings for rain or shine
13879,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Under green bed-clothes in '69.
13880,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
13881,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Know old Cambridge? Hope you do.--
13882,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Born there? Don't say so! I was, too."
13883,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"(Born in a house with a gambrel-roof,--"
13884,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Standing still, if you must have proof.--"
13885,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""Gambrel?--Gambrel?""--Let me beg"
13886,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"You'll look at a horse's hinder leg,--"
13887,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"First great angle above the hoof,--"
13888,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That 's the gambrel; hence gambrel-roof.)
13889,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Nicest place that ever was seen,--"
13890,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Colleges red and Common green,"
13891,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Sidewalks brownish with trees between.
13892,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Sweetest spot beneath the skies
13893,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When the canker-worms don't rise,--"
13894,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When the dust, that sometimes flies"
13895,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Into your mouth and ears and eyes,"

13898,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Such as barefoot children prize.
13899,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
13900,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"A kind of harbor it seems to be,"
13901,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Facing the flow of a boundless sea.
13902,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Rows of gray old Tutors stand
13903,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Ranged like rocks above the sand;
13904,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Rolling beneath them, soft and green,"
13905,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Breaks the tide of bright sixteen,--"
13906,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"One wave, two waves, three waves, four,--"

13909,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Then it ebbs to flow no more,"
13910,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Wandering off from shore to shore

13912,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Pleasant place for boys to play;--
13913,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Better keep your girls away;
13914,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Hearts get rolled as pebbles do
13915,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Which countless fingering waves pursue,"
13916,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And every classic beach is strown
13917,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,With heart-shaped pebbles of blood-red stone.
13918,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
13919,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But this is neither here nor there;
13920,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,I'm talking about an old arm-chair.
13921,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"You 've heard, no doubt, of PARSON TURELL?"
13922,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Over at Medford he used to dwell;
13923,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Married one of the Mathers' folk;
13924,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Got with his wife a chair of oak,--"
13925,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Funny old chair with seat like wedge,"
13926,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Sharp behind and broad front edge,--"
13927,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"One of the oddest of human things,"
13928,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Turned all over with knobs and rings,--"
13929,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"But heavy, and wide, and deep, and grand,--"
13930,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Fit for the worthies of the land,--"
13931,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Chief Justice Sewall a cause to try in,"
13932,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Or Cotton Mather to sit--and lie--in.
13933,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Parson Turell bequeathed the same
13934,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"To a certain student,--SMITH by name;"
13935,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"These were the terms, as we are told:"
13936,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""Saide Smith saide Chaire to have and holde;"
13937,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When he doth graduate, then to passe"
13938,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,To ye oldest Youth in ye Senior Classe.
13939,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"On payment of ""--(naming a certain sum)--"
13940,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""By him to whom ye Chaire shall come;"
13941,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He to ye oldest Senior next,"
13942,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And soe forever,""--(thus runs the text,)--"
13943,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""But one Crown lesse then he gave to claime,"
13944,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"That being his Debte for use of same."""
13945,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Smith transferred it to one of the BROWNS,"
13946,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And took his money,--five silver crowns."
13947,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Brown delivered it up to MOORE,"
13948,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Who paid, it is plain, not five, but four."
13949,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Moore made over the chair to LEE,"
13950,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Who gave him crowns of silver three.
13951,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Lee conveyed it unto DREW,"
13952,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And now the payment, of course, was two."
13953,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Drew gave up the chair to DUNN,--"
13954,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"All he got, as you see, was one."
13955,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Dunn released the chair to HALL,"
13956,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And got by the bargain no crown at all.
13957,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And now it passed to a second BROWN,"
13958,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Who took it and likewise claimed a crown.
13959,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When Brown conveyed it unto WARE,"
13960,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Having had one crown, to make it fair,"
13961,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,He paid him two crowns to take the chair;
13962,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And Ware, being honest, (as all Wares be,)"
13963,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He paid one POTTER, who took it, three."
13964,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Four got ROBINSON; five got Dix;
13965,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,JOHNSON primus demanded six;
13966,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And so the sum kept gathering still
13967,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Till after the battle of Bunker's Hill.
13968,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
13969,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When paper money became so cheap,"
13970,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Folks would n't count it, but said ""a heap,"""
13971,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"A certain RICHARDS,--the books declare,--"
13972,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,(A. M. in '90? I've looked with care
13973,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Through the Triennial,--name not there,)--"
13974,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"This person, Richards, was offered then"
13975,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Eightscore pounds, but would have ten;"
13976,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Nine, I think, was the sum he took,--"
13977,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Not quite certain,--but see the book."
13978,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"By and by the wars were still,"
13979,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But nothing had altered the Parson's will.
13980,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The old arm-chair was solid yet,"
13981,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But saddled with such a monstrous debt!
13982,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Things grew quite too bad to bear,"
13983,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Paying such sums to get rid of the chair
13984,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"But dead men's fingers hold awful tight,"
13985,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And there was the will in black and white,"
13986,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Plain enough for a child to spell.
13987,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"What should be done no man could tell,"
13988,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"For the chair was a kind of nightmare curse,"
13989,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And every season but made it worse.
13990,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
13991,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"As a last resort, to clear the doubt,"
13992,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,They got old GOVERNOR HANCOCK out.
13993,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Governor came with his Lighthorse Troop
13994,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And his mounted truckmen, all cock-a-hoop;"
13995,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Halberds glittered and colors flew,"
13996,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"French horns whinnied and trumpets blew,"
13997,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The yellow fifes whistled between their teeth,"
13998,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And the bumble-bee bass-drums boomed beneath;
13999,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"So he rode with all his band,"
14000,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Till the President met him, cap in hand."
14001,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The Governor ""hefted"" the crowns, and said,--"
14002,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""A will is a will, and the Parson's dead."""
14003,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The Governor hefted the crowns. Said he,--"
14004,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""There is your p'int. And here 's my fee."
14005,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
14006,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""These are the terms you must fulfil,--"
14007,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"On such conditions I BREAK THE WILL!"""
14008,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Governor mentioned what these should be.
14009,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,(Just wait a minute and then you 'll see.)
14010,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The President prayed. Then all was still,"
14011,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And the Governor rose and BROKE THE WILL!
14012,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""About those conditions?"" Well, now you go"
14013,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And do as I tell you, and then you'll know."
14014,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Once a year, on Commencement day,"
14015,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"If you 'll only take the pains to stay,"
14016,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"You'll see the President in the CHAIR,"
14017,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Likewise the Governor sitting there.
14018,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The President rises; both old and young
14019,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"May hear his speech in a foreign tongue,"
14020,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The meaning whereof, as lawyers swear,"
14021,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Is this: Can I keep this old arm-chair?
14022,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And then his Excellency bows,"
14023,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,As much as to say that he allows.
14024,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Vice-Gub. next is called by name;
14025,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He bows like t' other, which means the same."
14026,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And all the officers round 'em bow,"
14027,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,As much as to say that they allow.
14028,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And a lot of parchments about the chair
14029,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Are handed to witnesses then and there,"
14030,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And then the lawyers hold it clear
14031,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That the chair is safe for another year.
14032,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
14033,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"God bless you, Gentlemen! Learn to give"
14034,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Money to colleges while you live.
14035,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Don't be silly and think you'll try
14036,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"To bother the colleges, when you die,"
14037,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"With codicil this, and codicil that,"
14038,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That Knowledge may starve while Law grows fat;
14039,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"For there never was pitcher that wouldn't spill,"
14040,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And there's always a flaw in a donkey's will!

14602,THE DIVINE VOICE,"That all obey,--the sad and silent three;"
14603,THE DIVINE VOICE,"These only, while the hosts of Heaven rejoice,"
14604,THE DIVINE VOICE,Smile never; ask them what their sorrows be;
14605,THE DIVINE VOICE,
14606,THE DIVINE VOICE,"And when the secret of their griefs they tell,"
14607,THE DIVINE VOICE,"Look on them with thy mild, half-human eyes;"

14629,FIRST SPIRIT,"Sometimes a sunlit sphere comes rolling by,"
14630,FIRST SPIRIT,"And then we softly whisper,--can it be?"

14632,FIRST SPIRIT,To hear the music of its murmuring sea;
14633,FIRST SPIRIT,
14634,FIRST SPIRIT,"To catch, perchance, some flashing glimpse of green,"
14635,FIRST SPIRIT,"Or breathe some wild-wood fragrance, wafted through"

14758,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"WHATEVER I do, and whatever I say,"
14759,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,Aunt Tabitha tells me that is n't the way;
14760,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,When she was a girl (forty summers ago)
14761,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,Aunt Tabitha tells me they never did so.
14762,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,
14763,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,Dear aunt! If I only would take her advice!
14764,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"But I like my own way, and I find it so nice"
14765,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"And besides, I forget half the things I am told;"
14766,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,But they all will come back to me--when I am old.
14767,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,
14768,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"If a youth passes by, it may happen, no doubt,"
14769,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,He may chance to look in as I chance to look out;
14770,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"She would never endure an impertinent stare,--"
14771,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"It is horrid, she says, and I must n't sit there."
14772,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,
14773,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"A walk in the moonlight has pleasures, I own,"
14774,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,But it is n't quite safe to be walking alone;
14775,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"So I take a lad's arm,--just for safety, you know,--"
14776,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,But Aunt Tabitha tells me they did n't do so.
14777,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,
14778,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,"How wicked we are, and how good they were then!"
14779,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,They kept at arm's length those detestable men;
14780,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,What an era of virtue she lived in!--But stay--
14781,THE YOUNG GIRL'S POEM,Were the men all such rogues in Aunt Tabitha's day?

14813,AMBITION,To plant my ladder and to gain the round
14814,AMBITION,"That leads my footsteps to the heaven of fame,"
14815,AMBITION,Where waits the wreath my sleepless midnights won?
14816,AMBITION,Not the stained laurel such as heroes wear
14817,AMBITION,That withers when some stronger conqueror's heel
14818,AMBITION,Treads down their shrivelling trophies in the dust;
14819,AMBITION,But the fair garland whose undying green
14820,AMBITION,"Not time can change, nor wrath of gods or men!"
14821,AMBITION,
14822,AMBITION,With quickened heart-beats I shall hear tongues

14824,AMBITION,"That in the unshaped ages, buried deep"
14825,AMBITION,In the dark mines of unaccomplished time
14826,AMBITION,Yet to be stamped with morning's royal die
14827,AMBITION,"And coined in golden days,--in those dim years"
14828,AMBITION,"I shall be reckoned with the undying dead,"
14829,AMBITION,"My name emblazoned on the fiery arch,"
14830,AMBITION,Unfading till the stars themselves shall fade.
14831,AMBITION,"Then, as they call the roll of shining worlds,"
14832,AMBITION,Sages of race unborn in accents new
14833,AMBITION,"Shall count me with the Olympian ones of old,"
14834,AMBITION,Whose glories kindle through the midnight sky
14835,AMBITION,Here glows the God of Battles; this recalls
14836,AMBITION,"The Lord of Ocean, and yon far-off sphere"
14837,AMBITION,The Sire of Him who gave his ancient name
14838,AMBITION,To the dim planet with the wondrous rings;
14839,AMBITION,"Here flames the Queen of Beauty's silver lamp,"
14840,AMBITION,And there the moon-girt orb of mighty Jove;
14841,AMBITION,"But this, unseen through all earth's ions past,"
14842,AMBITION,A youth who watched beneath the western star
14843,AMBITION,"Sought in the darkness, found, and shewed to men;"
14844,AMBITION,Linked with his name thenceforth and evermore
14845,AMBITION,So shall that name be syllabled anew
14846,AMBITION,In all the tongues of all the tribes of men:
14847,AMBITION,I that have been through immemorial years
14848,AMBITION,Dust in the dust of my forgotten time
14849,AMBITION,"Shall live in accents shaped of blood-warm breath,"
14850,AMBITION,"Yea, rise in mortal semblance, newly born"
14851,AMBITION,"In shining stone, in undecaying bronze,"
14852,AMBITION,"And stand on high, and look serenely down"
14853,AMBITION,On the new race that calls the earth its own.
14854,AMBITION,
14855,AMBITION,"Is this a cloud, that, blown athwart my soul,"
14856,AMBITION,Wears a false seeming of the pearly stain
14857,AMBITION,Where worlds beyond the world their mingling rays
14858,AMBITION,"Blend in soft white,--a cloud that, born of earth,"
14859,AMBITION,Would cheat the soul that looks for light from heaven?
14860,AMBITION,Must every coral-insect leave his sign
14861,AMBITION,"On each poor grain he lent to build the reef,"
14862,AMBITION,"As Babel's builders stamped their sunburnt clay,"
14863,AMBITION,Or deem his patient service all in vain?
14864,AMBITION,What if another sit beneath the shade
14865,AMBITION,"Of the broad elm I planted by the way,--"
14866,AMBITION,What if another heed the beacon light
14867,AMBITION,"I set upon the rock that wrecked my keel,--"
14868,AMBITION,Have I not done my task and served my kind?
14869,AMBITION,"Nay, rather act thy part, unnamed, unknown,"

14871,AMBITION,"With noisy wind to swell a fool's renown,"
14872,AMBITION,"Joined with some truth he stumbled blindly o'er,"
14873,AMBITION,Or coupled with some single shining deed
14874,AMBITION,That in the great account of all his days
14875,AMBITION,Will stand alone upon the bankrupt sheet
14876,AMBITION,His pitying angel shows the clerk of Heaven.
14877,AMBITION,"The noblest service comes from nameless hands,"
14878,AMBITION,And the best servant does his work unseen.
14879,AMBITION,"Who found the seeds of fire and made them shoot,"
14880,AMBITION,"Fed by his breath, in buds and flowers of flame?"
14881,AMBITION,"Who forged in roaring flames the ponderous stone,"
14882,AMBITION,And shaped the moulded metal to his need?
14883,AMBITION,"Who gave the dragging car its rolling wheel,"
14884,AMBITION,And tamed the steed that whirls its circling round?
14885,AMBITION,"All these have left their work and not their names,--"
14886,AMBITION,Why should I murmur at a fate like theirs?

14903,REGRETS,
14904,REGRETS,"Here am I, bound upon this pillared rock,"
14905,REGRETS,Prey to the vulture of a vast desire

14922,REGRETS,"Steal all the freshness from my fading cheek,"
14923,REGRETS,And leave its shadows round my caverned eyes.
14924,REGRETS,All for a line in some unheeded scroll;
14925,REGRETS,"All for a stone that tells to gaping clowns,"

14939,REGRETS,"Write our great books to teach men who we are,"
14940,REGRETS,Sing our fine songs that tell in artful phrase
14941,REGRETS,"The secrets of our lives, and plead and pray"

14987,SYMPATHIES,THE snows that glittered on the disk of Mars
14988,SYMPATHIES,"Have melted, and the planet's fiery orb"
14989,SYMPATHIES,Rolls in the crimson summer of its year;
14990,SYMPATHIES,But what to me the summer or the snow
14991,SYMPATHIES,"Of worlds that throb with life in forms unknown,"
14992,SYMPATHIES,If life indeed be theirs; I heed not these.
14993,SYMPATHIES,My heart is simply human; all my care
14994,SYMPATHIES,For them whose dust is fashioned like mine own;
14995,SYMPATHIES,"These ache with cold and hunger, live in pain,"
14996,SYMPATHIES,And shake with fear of worlds more full of woe;
14997,SYMPATHIES,"There may be others worthier of my love,"

15002,SYMPATHIES,And not that other self which nods and smiles
15003,SYMPATHIES,"And babbles in our name; the one is Prayer,"
15004,SYMPATHIES,Lending its licensed freedom to the tongue
15005,SYMPATHIES,That tells our sorrows and our sins to Heaven;
15006,SYMPATHIES,"The other, Verse, that throws its spangled web"
15007,SYMPATHIES,Around our naked speech and makes it bold.
15008,SYMPATHIES,"I, whose best prayer is silence; sitting dumb"
15009,SYMPATHIES,In the great temple where I nightly serve
15010,SYMPATHIES,"Him who is throned in light, have dared to claim"
15011,SYMPATHIES,"The poet's franchise, though I may not hope"

15018,SYMPATHIES,"Between me and the fairest of the stars,"
15019,SYMPATHIES,I tell my lonely thoughts as unto thee.
15020,SYMPATHIES,Look not for marvels of the scholar's pen
15021,SYMPATHIES,In my rude measure; I can only show
15022,SYMPATHIES,"A slender-margined, unillumined page,"
15023,SYMPATHIES,And trust its meaning to the flattering eye
15024,SYMPATHIES,That reads it in the gracious light of love.
15025,SYMPATHIES,"Ah, wouldst thou clothe thyself in breathing shape"
15026,SYMPATHIES,"And nestle at my side, my voice should lend"
15027,SYMPATHIES,Whate'er my verse may lack of tender rhythm
15028,SYMPATHIES,To make thee listen.
15029,SYMPATHIES,
15030,SYMPATHIES,I have stood entranced
15031,SYMPATHIES,"When, with her fingers wandering o'er the keys,"
15032,SYMPATHIES,The white enchantress with the golden hair
15033,SYMPATHIES,Breathed all her soul through some unvalued rhyme;
15034,SYMPATHIES,Some flower of song that long had lost its bloom;
15035,SYMPATHIES,Lo! its dead summer kindled as she sang!
15036,SYMPATHIES,"The sweet contralto, like the ringdove's coo,"
15037,SYMPATHIES,"Thrilled it with brooding, fond, caressing tones,"
15038,SYMPATHIES,"And the pale minstrel's passion lived again,"
15039,SYMPATHIES,Tearful and trembling as a dewy rose
15040,SYMPATHIES,The wind has shaken till it fills the air
15041,SYMPATHIES,With light and fragrance. Such the wondrous charm
15042,SYMPATHIES,A song can borrow when the bosom throbs
15043,SYMPATHIES,That lends it breath.
15044,SYMPATHIES,
15045,SYMPATHIES,So from the poet's lips
15046,SYMPATHIES,"His verse sounds doubly sweet, for none like him"
15047,SYMPATHIES,Feels every cadence of its wave-like flow;
15048,SYMPATHIES,"He lives the passion over, while he reads,"
15049,SYMPATHIES,"That shook him as he sang his lofty strain,"
15050,SYMPATHIES,"And pours his life through each resounding line,"
15051,SYMPATHIES,"As ocean, when the stormy winds are hushed,"
15052,SYMPATHIES,Still rolls and thunders through his billowy caves.

15066,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"His hollow sceptre ruled, or seemed to rule,"
15067,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres,"

15071,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,As on a rosary a saint his beads.
15072,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,I was his only scholar; I became

15091,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,

15095,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"But I for him, a shadow, a defence,"
15096,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"The guardian of his fame, his guide, his staff,"
15097,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,Leaned on so long he fell if left alone.
15098,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"I was his eye, his ear, his cunning hand,"

15101,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"That sees its shortening span, its lengthening shades,"
15102,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"That clutches what it may with eager grasp,"
15103,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"And drops at last with empty, outstretched hands."
15104,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,All this he dreamed not. He would sit him down
15105,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Thinking to work his problems as of old,"
15106,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"And find the star he thought so plain a blur,"
15107,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,The columned figures labyrinthine wilds
15108,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Without my comment, blind and senseless scrawls"
15109,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,That vexed him with their riddles; he would strive

15368,RIGHTS,"I claim the rights of weakness, I, the babe,"
15369,RIGHTS,Call on my sire to shield me from the ills
15370,RIGHTS,"That still beset my path, not trying me"
15371,RIGHTS,"With snares beyond my wisdom or my strength,"
15372,RIGHTS,"He knowing I shall use them to my harm,"
15373,RIGHTS,And find a tenfold misery in the sense
15374,RIGHTS,That in my childlike folly I have sprung
15375,RIGHTS,"The trap upon myself as vermin use,"
15376,RIGHTS,Drawn by the cunning bait to certain doom.
15377,RIGHTS,Who wrought the wondrous charm that leads us on
15378,RIGHTS,"To sweet perdition, but the selfsame power"
15379,RIGHTS,That set the fearful engine to destroy
15380,RIGHTS,"His wretched offspring (as the Rabbis tell),"
15381,RIGHTS,And hid its yawning jaws and treacherous springs
15382,RIGHTS,In such a show of innocent sweet flowers
15383,RIGHTS,It lured the sinless angels and they fell?
15384,RIGHTS,Ah! He who prayed the prayer of all mankind
15385,RIGHTS,Summed in those few brief words the mightiest plea
15386,RIGHTS,"For erring souls before the courts of heaven,--"
15387,RIGHTS,"_Save us from being tempted_,--lest we fall!"
15388,RIGHTS,
15389,RIGHTS,If we are only as the potter's clay
15390,RIGHTS,"Made to be fashioned as the artist wills,"
15391,RIGHTS,And broken into shards if we offend
15392,RIGHTS,"The eye of Him who made us, it is well;"
15393,RIGHTS,Such love as the insensate lump of clay
15394,RIGHTS,That spins upon the swift-revolving wheel
15395,RIGHTS,"Bears to the hand that shapes its growing form,--"
15396,RIGHTS,"Such love, no more, will be our hearts' return"
15397,RIGHTS,"To the great Master-workman for his care,--"
15398,RIGHTS,"Or would be, save that this, our breathing clay,"
15399,RIGHTS,Is intertwined with fine innumerous threads
15400,RIGHTS,That make it conscious in its framer's hand;
15401,RIGHTS,And this He must remember who has filled
15402,RIGHTS,"These vessels with the deadly draught of life,--"
15403,RIGHTS,"Life, that means death to all it claims. Our love"
15404,RIGHTS,"Must kindle in the ray that streams from heaven,"
15405,RIGHTS,A faint reflection of the light divine;
15406,RIGHTS,The sun must warm the earth before the rose
15407,RIGHTS,Can show her inmost heart-leaves to the sun.
15408,RIGHTS,
15409,RIGHTS,He yields some fraction of the Maker's right
15410,RIGHTS,Who gives the quivering nerve its sense of pain;
15411,RIGHTS,Is there not something in the pleading eye
15412,RIGHTS,"Of the poor brute that suffers, which arraigns"
15413,RIGHTS,The law that bids it suffer? Has it not
15414,RIGHTS,A claim for some remembrance in the book
15415,RIGHTS,That fills its pages with the idle words
15416,RIGHTS,"Spoken of men? Or is it only clay,"
15417,RIGHTS,"Bleeding and aching in the potter's hand,"
15418,RIGHTS,Yet all his own to treat it as He will
15419,RIGHTS,"And when He will to cast it at his feet,"
15420,RIGHTS,"Shattered, dishonored, lost forevermore?"
15421,RIGHTS,"My dog loves me, but could he look beyond"
15422,RIGHTS,"His earthly master, would his love extend"
15423,RIGHTS,To Him who--Hush! I will not doubt that He
15424,RIGHTS,"Is better than our fears, and will not wrong"
15425,RIGHTS,"The least, the meanest of created things!"
15426,RIGHTS,
15427,RIGHTS,He would not trust me with the smallest orb
15428,RIGHTS,That circles through the sky; He would not give
15429,RIGHTS,A meteor to my guidance; would not leave
15430,RIGHTS,The coloring of a cloudlet to my hand;
15431,RIGHTS,He locks my beating heart beneath its bars
15432,RIGHTS,And keeps the key himself; He measures out
15433,RIGHTS,"The draughts of vital breath that warm my blood,"
15434,RIGHTS,"Winds up the springs of instinct which uncoil,"
15435,RIGHTS,"Each in its season; ties me to my home,"
15436,RIGHTS,"My race, my time, my nation, and my creed"
15437,RIGHTS,So closely that if I but slip my wrist
15438,RIGHTS,"Out of the band that cuts it to the bone,"
15439,RIGHTS,"Men say, ""He hath a devil;"" He has lent"
15440,RIGHTS,"All that I hold in trust, as unto one"
15441,RIGHTS,By reason of his weakness and his years
15442,RIGHTS,Not fit to hold the smallest shred in fee
15443,RIGHTS,"Of those most common things he calls his own,--"
15444,RIGHTS,And yet--my Rabbi tells me--He has left
15445,RIGHTS,The care of that to which a million worlds
15446,RIGHTS,"Filled with unconscious life were less than naught,"
15447,RIGHTS,"Has left that mighty universe, the Soul,"
15448,RIGHTS,"To the weak guidance of our baby hands,"
15449,RIGHTS,"Let the foul fiends have access at their will,"
15450,RIGHTS,"Taking the shape of angels, to our hearts,--"
15451,RIGHTS,Our hearts already poisoned through and through
15452,RIGHTS,With the fierce virus of ancestral sin;
15453,RIGHTS,"Turned us adrift with our immortal charge,"
15454,RIGHTS,To wreck ourselves in gulfs of endless woe.
15455,RIGHTS,
15456,RIGHTS,If what my Rabbi tells me is the truth
15457,RIGHTS,Why did the choir of angels sing for joy?
15458,RIGHTS,"Heaven must be compassed in a narrow space,"
15459,RIGHTS,And offer more than room enough for all
15460,RIGHTS,"That pass its portals; but the under-world,"
15461,RIGHTS,"The godless realm, the place where demons forge"
15462,RIGHTS,"Their fiery darts and adamantine chains,"
15463,RIGHTS,Must swarm with ghosts that for a little while
15464,RIGHTS,"Had worn the garb of flesh, and being heirs"
15465,RIGHTS,"Of all the dulness of their stolid sires,"
15466,RIGHTS,"And all the erring instincts of their tribe,"
15467,RIGHTS,"Nature's own teaching, rudiments of ""sin,"""
15468,RIGHTS,Fell headlong in the snare that could not fail
15469,RIGHTS,To trap the wretched creatures shaped of clay
15470,RIGHTS,And cursed with sense enough to lose their souls!
15471,RIGHTS,
15472,RIGHTS,"Brother, thy heart is troubled at my word;"
15473,RIGHTS,"Sister, I see the cloud is on thy brow."
15474,RIGHTS,"He will not blame me, He who sends not peace,"
15475,RIGHTS,"But sends a sword, and bids us strike amain"
15476,RIGHTS,"At Error's gilded crest, where in the van"
15477,RIGHTS,"Of earth's great army, mingling with the best"
15478,RIGHTS,"And bravest of its leaders, shouting loud"
15479,RIGHTS,The battle-cries that yesterday have led
15480,RIGHTS,"The host of Truth to victory, but to-day"
15481,RIGHTS,"Are watchwords of the laggard and the slave,"
15482,RIGHTS,He leads his dazzled cohorts. God has made
15483,RIGHTS,This world a strife of atoms and of spheres;
15484,RIGHTS,With every breath I sigh myself away
15485,RIGHTS,And take my tribute from the wandering wind
15486,RIGHTS,To fan the flame of life's consuming fire;
15487,RIGHTS,"So, while my thought has life, it needs must burn,"
15488,RIGHTS,"And, burning, set the stubble-fields ablaze,"
15489,RIGHTS,Where all the harvest long ago was reaped
15490,RIGHTS,And safely garnered in the ancient barns.
15491,RIGHTS,"But still the gleaners, groping for their food,"
15492,RIGHTS,"Go blindly feeling through the close-shorn straw,"
15493,RIGHTS,"While the young reapers flash, their glittering steel"

15504,TRUTHS,"The terror of the household and its shame,"

15506,TRUTHS,"That some would strangle, some would only starve;"
15507,TRUTHS,"But still it breathes, and passed from hand to hand,"

16115,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Dear is that ancient name's renown,"
16116,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"For many a civic wreath they won,"
16117,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,The youthful sire and the gray-haired son.
16118,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
16119,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,O Damsel Dorothy! Dorothy Q.!
16120,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Strange is the gift that I owe to you;
16121,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Such a gift as never a king
16122,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Save to daughter or son might bring,--"
16123,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"All my tenure of heart and hand,"
16124,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,All my title to house and land;
16125,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Mother and sister and child and wife
16126,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And joy and sorrow and death and life!
16127,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
16128,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,What if a hundred years ago
16129,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Those close-shut lips had answered No,"
16130,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,When forth the tremulous question came
16131,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"That cost the maiden her Norman name,"
16132,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And under the folds that look so still
16133,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,The bodice swelled with the bosom's thrill?
16134,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Should I be I, or would it be"
16135,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"One tenth another, to nine tenths me?"
16136,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
16137,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Soft is the breath of a maiden's YES
16138,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Not the light gossamer stirs with less;
16139,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,But never a cable that holds so fast
16140,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Through all the battles of wave and blast,"
16141,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And never an echo of speech or song
16142,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,That lives in the babbling air so long!
16143,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,There were tones in the voice that whispered then
16144,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,You may hear to-day in a hundred men.
16145,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
16146,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"O lady and lover, how faint and far"
16147,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Your images hover,--and here we are,"
16148,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Solid and stirring in flesh and bone,--"
16149,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Edward's and Dorothy's--all their own,--"
16150,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,A goodly record for Time to show
16151,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,Of a syllable spoken so long ago!--
16152,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"Shall I bless you, Dorothy, or forgive"
16153,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,For the tender whisper that bade me live?
16154,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
16155,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"It shall be a blessing, my little maid!"
16156,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"I will heal the stab of the Red-Coat's blade,"
16157,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame,"
16158,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And gild with a rhyme your household name;
16159,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,So you shall smile on us brave and bright
16160,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,"As first you greeted the morning's light,"
16161,A FAMILY PORTRAIT,And live untroubled by woes and fears

16175,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"(Forgive me, Heaven, my wandering eyes!)"
16176,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"A moment lost, the next half seen,"
16177,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"His head above the scanty screen,"
16178,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Still measuring out his deep salaams
16179,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Through quavering hymns and panting psalms.
16180,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
16181,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"No priest that prays in gilded stole,"
16182,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,To save a rich man's mortgaged soul;

16184,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"So humbly stoops, so meekly bows;"
16185,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,His large obeisance puts to shame
16186,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"The proudest genuflecting dame,"
16187,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Whose Easter bonnet low descends
16188,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,With all the grace devotion lends.
16189,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
16190,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"O brother with the supple spine,"
16191,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,How much we owe those bows of thine
16192,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Without thine arm to lend the breeze,"
16193,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,How vain the finger on the keys!
16194,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Though all unmatched the player's skill,"
16195,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Those thousand throats were dumb and still:
16196,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Another's art may shape the tone,"
16197,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,The breath that fills it is thine own.
16198,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
16199,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Six days the silent Memnon waits
16200,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Behind his temple's folded gates;

16216,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,

16218,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,Art always ready in thy place;
16219,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Thy strenuous blast, whate'er the tune,"
16220,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,As steady as the strong monsoon;
16221,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Thy only dread a leathery creak,"
16222,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Or small residual extra squeak,"
16223,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,To send along the shadowy aisles
16224,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,A sunlit wave of dimpled smiles.
16225,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,
16226,THE ORGAN-BLOWER,"Not all the preaching, O my friend,"

16275,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Ah, cursed, unbelieving Jew"

16277,AT THE PANTOMIME,And squeezed--a second Israelite.
16278,AT THE PANTOMIME,
16279,AT THE PANTOMIME,Then woke the evil brood of rage
16280,AT THE PANTOMIME,"That slumber, tongueless, in their cage;"

16282,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The hook-nosed kite of carrion clothes,"
16283,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The snaky usurer, him that crawls"
16284,AT THE PANTOMIME,"And cheats beneath the golden balls,"

16305,AT THE PANTOMIME,
16306,AT THE PANTOMIME,A fresh young cheek whose olive hue

16316,AT THE PANTOMIME,"That flows immingled from the Flood,--"
16317,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy scutcheon spotted with the stains
16318,AT THE PANTOMIME,Of Norman thieves and pirate Danes!
16319,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The New World's foundling, in thy pride"
16320,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Scowl on the Hebrew at thy side,"
16321,AT THE PANTOMIME,And lo! the very semblance there
16322,AT THE PANTOMIME,The Lord of Glory deigned to wear!
16323,AT THE PANTOMIME,
16324,AT THE PANTOMIME,"I see that radiant image rise,"
16325,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The flowing hair, the pitying eyes,"
16326,AT THE PANTOMIME,The faintly crimsoned cheek that shows
16327,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The blush of Sharon's opening rose,--"
16328,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy hands would clasp his hallowed feet
16329,AT THE PANTOMIME,"Whose brethren soil thy Christian seat,"
16330,AT THE PANTOMIME,Thy lips would press his garment's hem
16331,AT THE PANTOMIME,That curl in wrathful scorn for them!
16332,AT THE PANTOMIME,
16333,AT THE PANTOMIME,"A sudden mist, a watery screen,"
16334,AT THE PANTOMIME,Dropped like a veil before the scene;
16335,AT THE PANTOMIME,"The shadow floated from my soul,"
16336,AT THE PANTOMIME,"And to my lips a whisper stole,--"

16370,AFTER THE FIRE,
16371,AFTER THE FIRE,"On roof and wall, on dome and spire,"

17314,"DECEMBER 9, 1871","It springs to the lips that are waiting to part,"

17317,"DECEMBER 9, 1871","Its accents may vary, its sound may be strange,"

17337,"DECEMBER 9, 1871",The word that he spoke to the Pilgrim of old

17592,"NOVEMBER 3, 1864","As the fair cedar, fallen before the breeze,"

17595,"NOVEMBER 3, 1864","Poets, like youngest children, never grow"

20894,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",This faded vesture which it calls its own.
20895,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Here sleeps my father's sire, and they who gave"
20896,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That earlier life here found their peaceful grave.
20897,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In days gone by I sought the hallowed ground;
20898,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Climbed yon long slope; the sacred spot I found
20899,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Where all unsullied lies the winter snow,"
20900,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Where all ungathered spring's pale violets blow,"
20901,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And tracked from stone to stone the Saxon name
20902,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","That marks the blood I need not blush to claim,"
20903,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Blood such as warmed the Pilgrim sons of toil,"
20904,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Who held from God the charter of the soil.
20905,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","I come an alien to your hills and plains,"
20906,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Yet feel your birthright tingling in my veins;
20907,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Mine are this changing prospect's sun and shade,"
20908,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In full-blown summer's bridal pomp arrayed;
20909,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Mine these fair hillsides and the vales between;
20910,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green;
20911,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",I breathed your air--the sunlit landscape smiled;
20912,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",I touch your soil--it knows its children's child;
20913,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Throned in my heart your heritage is mine;
20914,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",I claim it all by memory's right divine
20915,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Waking, I dream. Before my vacant eyes"
20916,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In long procession shadowy forms arise;
20917,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Far through the vista of the silent years
20918,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","I see a venturous band; the pioneers,"
20919,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Who let the sunlight through the forest's gloom,"
20920,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Who bade the harvest wave, the garden bloom."
20921,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Hark! loud resounds the bare-armed settler's axe,"
20922,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",See where the stealthy panther left his tracks!
20923,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","As fierce, as stealthy creeps the skulking foe"
20924,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",With stone-tipped shaft and sinew-corded bow;
20925,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign,"
20926,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Leave his last cornfield to the coming train,"
20927,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Quit the green margin of the wave he drinks,"
20928,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",For haunts that hide the wild-cat and the lynx.
20929,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
20930,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",But who the Youth his glistening axe that swings
20931,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",To smite the pine that shows a hundred rings?
20932,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",His features?--something in his look I find
20933,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That calls the semblance of my race to mind.
20934,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",His name?--my own; and that which goes before
20935,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The same that once the loved disciple bore.
20936,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Young, brave, discreet, the father of a line"
20937,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose voiceless lives have found a voice in mine;
20938,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Thinned by unnumbered currents though they be,"
20939,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Thanks for the ruddy drops I claim from thee!
20940,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
20941,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The seasons pass; the roses come and go;
20942,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Snows fall and melt; the waters freeze and flow;
20943,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The boys are men; the girls, grown tall and fair,"
20944,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Have found their mates; a gravestone here and there
20945,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Tells where the fathers lie; the silvered hair
20946,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Of some bent patriarch yet recalls the time
20947,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","That saw his feet the northern hillside climb,"
20948,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","A pilgrim from the pilgrims far away,"
20949,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The godly men, the dwellers by the bay."
20950,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On many a hearthstone burns the cheerful fire;
20951,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The schoolhouse porch, the heavenward pointing spire"
20952,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Proclaim in letters every eye can read,"
20953,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Knowledge and Faith, the new world's simple creed."
20954,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Hush! 't is the Sabbath's silence-stricken morn
20955,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No feet must wander through the tasselled corn;
20956,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","No merry children laugh around the door,"
20957,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No idle playthings strew the sanded floor;
20958,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The law of Moses lays its awful ban
20959,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On all that stirs; here comes the tithing-man
20960,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",At last the solemn hour of worship calls;
20961,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Slowly they gather in the sacred walls;
20962,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Man in his strength and age with knotted staff,"
20963,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","And boyhood aching for its week-day laugh,"
20964,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The toil-worn mother with the child she leads,"
20965,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The maiden, lovely in her golden beads,--"
20966,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The popish symbols round her neck she wears,"
20967,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","But on them counts her lovers, not her prayers,--"
20968,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Those youths in homespun suits and ribboned queues,"
20969,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose hearts are beating in the high-backed pews.
20970,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The pastor rises; looks along the seats
20971,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",With searching eye; each wonted face he meets;
20972,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Asks heavenly guidance; finds the chapter's place
20973,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That tells some tale of Israel's stubborn race;
20974,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Gives out the sacred song; all voices join,"
20975,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",For no quartette extorts their scanty coin;
20976,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Then while both hands their black-gloved palms display,"
20977,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Lifts his gray head, and murmurs, ""Let us pray!"""
20978,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And pray he does! as one that never fears
20979,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",To plead unanswered by the God that hears;
20980,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",What if he dwells on many a fact as though
20981,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Some things Heaven knew not which it ought to know,--"
20982,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Thanks God for all his favors past, and yet,"
20983,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Tells Him there's something He must not forget;
20984,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Such are the prayers his people love to hear,--"
20985,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",See how the Deacon slants his listening ear!
20986,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","What! look once more! Nay, surely there I trace"
20987,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The hinted outlines of a well-known face!
20988,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not those the lips for laughter to beguile,"
20989,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile,"
20990,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The same on other lips my childhood knew
20991,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That scarce the Sabbath's mastery could subdue.
20992,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Him too my lineage gives me leave to claim,--"
20993,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The good, grave man that bears the Psalmist's name."
20994,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
20995,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And still in ceaseless round the seasons passed;
20996,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Spring piped her carol; Autumn blew his blast;
20997,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Babes waxed to manhood; manhood shrunk to age;
20998,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Life's worn-out players tottered off the stage;
20999,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The few are many; boys have grown to men
21000,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Since Putnam dragged the wolf from Pomfret's den;
21001,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Our new-old Woodstock is a thriving town;
21002,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Brave are her children; faithful to the crown;
21003,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Her soldiers' steel the savage redskin knows;
21004,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Their blood has crimsoned his Canadian snows.
21005,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And now once more along the quiet vale
21006,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale;
21007,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Full well they know the valorous heat that runs
21008,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In every pulse-beat of their loyal sons;
21009,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Who would not bleed in good King George's cause
21010,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",When England's lion shows his teeth and claws?
21011,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",With glittering firelocks on the village green
21012,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In proud array a martial band is seen;
21013,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","You know what names those ancient rosters hold,--"
21014,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose belts were buckled when the drum-beat rolled,--"
21015,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","But mark their Captain! tell us, who is he?"
21016,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On his brown face that same old look I see
21017,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Yes! from the homestead's still retreat he came,"
21018,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose peaceful owner bore the Psalmist's name;
21019,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The same his own. Well, Israel's glorious king"
21020,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Who struck the harp could also whirl the sling,--"
21021,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Breathe in his song a penitential sigh
21022,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And smite the sons of Amalek hip and thigh:
21023,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","These shared their task; one deaconed out the psalm,"
21024,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",One slashed the scalping hell-hounds of calm;
21025,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The praying father's pious work is done,"
21026,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son.
21027,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On many a field he fought in wilds afar;
21028,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",See on his swarthy cheek the bullet's scar!
21029,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","There hangs a murderous tomahawk; beneath,"
21030,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Without its blade, a knife's embroidered sheath;"
21031,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt
21032,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",His scalp had dangled at their owner's belt;
21033,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",But not for him such fate; he lived to see
21034,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The bloodier strife that made our nation free,"
21035,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","To serve with willing toil, with skilful hand,"
21036,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The war-worn saviors of the bleeding land.
21037,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","His wasting life to others' needs he gave,--"
21038,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Sought rest in home and found it in the grave.
21039,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","See where the stones life's brief memorials keep,"
21040,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The tablet telling where he ""fell on sleep,""--"
21041,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Watched by a winged cherub's rayless eye,--"
21042,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","A scroll above that says we all must die,--"
21043,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Those saddening lines beneath, the ""Night-Thoughts"" lent:"
21044,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","So stands the Soldier's, Surgeon's monument."
21045,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Ah! at a glance my filial eye divines
21046,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The scholar son in those remembered lines.
21047,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
21048,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The Scholar Son. His hand my footsteps led.
21049,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No more the dim unreal past I tread.
21050,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","O thou whose breathing form was once so dear,"
21051,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose cheering voice was music to my ear,"
21052,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Art thou not with me as my feet pursue
21053,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The village paths so well thy boyhood knew,"
21054,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Along the tangled margin of the stream
21055,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream,"
21056,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or climb the hill, or thread the wooded vale,"
21057,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail,"
21058,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or the old homestead's narrowed bounds explore,"
21059,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more,"
21060,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Where one last relic still remains to tell
21061,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Here stood thy home,--the memory-haunted well,"
21062,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine,"
21063,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Changed at my lips to sacramental wine,--"
21064,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Art thou not with me, as I fondly trace"
21065,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The scanty records of thine honored race,"
21066,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Call up the forms that earlier years have known,"
21067,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And spell the legend of each slanted stone?
21068,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","With thoughts of thee my loving verse began,"
21069,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not for the critic's curious eye to scan,"
21070,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not for the many listeners, but the few"
21071,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew;
21072,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns;
21073,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Still to my lips thy cherished name returns;
21074,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Could I but feel thy gracious presence near
21075,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Amid the groves that once to thee were dear
21076,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Could but my trembling lips with mortal speech
21077,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Thy listening ear for one brief moment reach!
21078,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",How vain the dream! The pallid voyager's track
21079,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No sign betrays; he sends no message back.
21080,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No word from thee since evening's shadow fell

21101,THE IRON GATE,"by the publishers of the ""Atlantic  Monthly,"" Boston, December 3, 1879."
21102,THE IRON GATE,
21103,THE IRON GATE,WHERE is this patriarch you are kindly greeting?
21104,THE IRON GATE,"Not unfamiliar to my ear his name,"
21105,THE IRON GATE,Nor yet unknown to many a joyous meeting
21106,THE IRON GATE,"In days long vanished,--is he still the same,"
21107,THE IRON GATE,
21108,THE IRON GATE,"Or changed by years, forgotten and forgetting,"
21109,THE IRON GATE,"Dull-eared, dim-sighted, slow of speech and thought,"
21110,THE IRON GATE,"Still o'er the sad, degenerate present fretting,"
21111,THE IRON GATE,"Where all goes wrong, and nothing as it ought?"
21112,THE IRON GATE,
21113,THE IRON GATE,"Old age, the graybeard! Well, indeed, I know him,--"
21114,THE IRON GATE,"Shrunk, tottering, bent, of aches and ills the prey;"
21115,THE IRON GATE,"In sermon, story, fable, picture, poem,"
21116,THE IRON GATE,Oft have I met him from my earliest day.
21117,THE IRON GATE,
21118,THE IRON GATE,"In my old AEsop, toiling with his bundle,--"
21119,THE IRON GATE,"His load of sticks,--politely asking Death,"
21120,THE IRON GATE,"Who comes when called for,--would he lug or trundle"
21121,THE IRON GATE,His fagot for him?--he was scant of breath.
21122,THE IRON GATE,
21123,THE IRON GATE,"And sad ""Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher,""--"
21124,THE IRON GATE,"Has he not stamped the image on my soul,"
21125,THE IRON GATE,"In that last chapter, where the worn-out Teacher"
21126,THE IRON GATE,"Sighs o'er the loosened cord, the broken bowl?"
21127,THE IRON GATE,
21128,THE IRON GATE,"Yes, long, indeed, I've known him at a distance,"
21129,THE IRON GATE,And now my lifted door-latch shows him here;
21130,THE IRON GATE,"I take his shrivelled hand without resistance,"
21131,THE IRON GATE,And find him smiling as his step draws near.
21132,THE IRON GATE,
21133,THE IRON GATE,"What though of gilded baubles he bereaves us,"
21134,THE IRON GATE,"Dear to the heart of youth, to manhood's prime;"
21135,THE IRON GATE,"Think of the calm he brings, the wealth he leaves us,"
21136,THE IRON GATE,"The hoarded spoils, the legacies of time!"
21137,THE IRON GATE,
21138,THE IRON GATE,"Altars once flaming, still with incense fragrant,"
21139,THE IRON GATE,"Passion's uneasy nurslings rocked asleep,"
21140,THE IRON GATE,"Hope's anchor faster, wild desire less vagrant,"
21141,THE IRON GATE,"Life's flow less noisy, but the stream how deep!"
21142,THE IRON GATE,
21143,THE IRON GATE,"Still as the silver cord gets worn and slender,"
21144,THE IRON GATE,"Its lightened task-work tugs with lessening strain,"
21145,THE IRON GATE,"Hands get more helpful, voices, grown more tender,"
21146,THE IRON GATE,Soothe with their softened tones the slumberous brain.
21147,THE IRON GATE,
21148,THE IRON GATE,"Youth longs and manhood strives, but age remembers,"
21149,THE IRON GATE,"Sits by the raked-up ashes of the past,"
21150,THE IRON GATE,Spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers
21151,THE IRON GATE,That warm its creeping life-blood till the last.
21152,THE IRON GATE,
21153,THE IRON GATE,Dear to its heart is every loving token
21154,THE IRON GATE,"That comes unbidden ere its pulse grows cold,"
21155,THE IRON GATE,"Ere the last lingering ties of life are broken,"
21156,THE IRON GATE,Its labors ended and its story told.
21157,THE IRON GATE,
21158,THE IRON GATE,"Ah, while around us rosy youth rejoices,"
21159,THE IRON GATE,"For us the sorrow-laden breezes sigh,"
21160,THE IRON GATE,And through the chorus of its jocund voices
21161,THE IRON GATE,Throbs the sharp note of misery's hopeless cry.
21162,THE IRON GATE,
21163,THE IRON GATE,As on the gauzy wings of fancy flying
21164,THE IRON GATE,"From some far orb I track our watery sphere,"
21165,THE IRON GATE,"Home of the struggling, suffering, doubting, dying,"
21166,THE IRON GATE,The silvered globule seems a glistening tear.
21167,THE IRON GATE,
21168,THE IRON GATE,But Nature lends her mirror of illusion
21169,THE IRON GATE,"To win from saddening scenes our age-dimmed eyes,"
21170,THE IRON GATE,And misty day-dreams blend in sweet confusion
21171,THE IRON GATE,The wintry landscape and the summer skies.
21172,THE IRON GATE,
21173,THE IRON GATE,"So when the iron portal shuts behind us,"
21174,THE IRON GATE,"And life forgets us in its noise and whirl,"
21175,THE IRON GATE,"Visions that shunned the glaring noonday find us,"
21176,THE IRON GATE,And glimmering starlight shows the gates of pearl.
21177,THE IRON GATE,
21178,THE IRON GATE,"I come not here your morning hour to sadden,"
21179,THE IRON GATE,"A limping pilgrim, leaning on his staff,--"
21180,THE IRON GATE,"I, who have never deemed it sin to gladden"
21181,THE IRON GATE,This vale of sorrows with a wholesome laugh.
21182,THE IRON GATE,
21183,THE IRON GATE,"If word of mine another's gloom has brightened,"
21184,THE IRON GATE,Through my dumb lips the heaven-sent message came;
21185,THE IRON GATE,"If hand of mine another's task has lightened,"
21186,THE IRON GATE,It felt the guidance that it dares not claim.
21187,THE IRON GATE,
21188,THE IRON GATE,"But, O my gentle sisters, O my brothers,"
21189,THE IRON GATE,These thick-sown snow-flakes hint of toil's release;
21190,THE IRON GATE,These feebler pulses bid me leave to others
21191,THE IRON GATE,The tasks once welcome; evening asks for peace.
21192,THE IRON GATE,
21193,THE IRON GATE,Time claims his tribute; silence now is golden;
21194,THE IRON GATE,Let me not vex the too long suffering lyre;
21195,THE IRON GATE,"Though to your love untiring still beholden,"
21196,THE IRON GATE,The curfew tells me--cover up the fire.
21197,THE IRON GATE,
21198,THE IRON GATE,"And now with grateful smile and accents cheerful,"
21199,THE IRON GATE,"And warmer heart than look or word can tell,"
21200,THE IRON GATE,In simplest phrase--these traitorous eyes are tearful--
21201,THE IRON GATE,"Thanks, Brothers, Sisters,--Children,--and farewell!"
21202,THE IRON GATE,
21203,THE IRON GATE,

21211,AN ACADEMIC POEM,1829-1879
21212,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21213,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Read at the Commencement Dinner of the Alumni of Harvard
21214,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"University, June 25, 1879."
21215,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21216,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"WHILE fond, sad memories all around us throng,"
21217,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Silence were sweeter than the sweetest song;
21218,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Yet when the leaves are green and heaven is blue,"
21219,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The choral tribute of the grove is due,"
21220,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And when the lengthening nights have chilled the skies,"
21221,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"We fain would hear the song-bird ere be flies,"
21222,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And greet with kindly welcome, even as now,"
21223,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The lonely minstrel on his leafless bough.
21224,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21225,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"This is our golden year,--its golden day;"
21226,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Its bridal memories soon must pass away;
21227,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Soon shall its dying music cease to ring,"
21228,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And every year must loose some silver string,"
21229,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Till the last trembling chords no longer thrill,--"
21230,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Hands all at rest and hearts forever still.
21231,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21232,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A few gray heads have joined the forming line;
21233,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"We hear our summons,--""Class of 'Twenty-Nine!"""
21234,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Close on the foremost, and, alas, how few!"
21235,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Are these ""The Boys"" our dear old Mother knew?"
21236,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Sixty brave swimmers. Twenty--something more--
21237,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Have passed the stream and reached this frosty shore!
21238,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21239,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How near the banks these fifty years divide
21240,AN ACADEMIC POEM,When memory crosses with a single stride!
21241,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"'T is the first year of stern ""Old Hickory"" 's rule"
21242,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"When our good Mother lets us out of school,"
21243,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Half glad, half sorrowing, it must be confessed,"
21244,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"To leave her quiet lap, her bounteous breast,"
21245,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Armed with our dainty, ribbon-tied degrees,"
21246,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Pleased and yet pensive, exiles and A. B.'s."
21247,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21248,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Look back, O comrades, with your faded eyes,"
21249,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And see the phantoms as I bid them rise.
21250,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Whose smile is that? Its pattern Nature gave,"
21251,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A sunbeam dancing in a dimpled wave;
21252,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"KIRKLAND alone such grace from Heaven could win,"
21253,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His features radiant as the soul within;
21254,AN ACADEMIC POEM,That smile would let him through Saint Peter's gate
21255,AN ACADEMIC POEM,While sad-eyed martyrs had to stand and wait.
21256,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Here flits mercurial _Farrar_; standing there,"
21257,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See mild, benignant, cautious, learned _Ware_,"
21258,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And sturdy, patient, faithful, honest _Hedge_,"
21259,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Whose grinding logic gave our wits their edge;
21260,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"_Ticknor_, with honeyed voice and courtly grace;"
21261,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And _Willard_, larynxed like a double bass;"
21262,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And _Channing_, with his bland, superior look,"
21263,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Cool as a moonbeam on a frozen brook,"
21264,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21265,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"While the pale student, shivering in his shoes,"
21266,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Sees from his theme the turgid rhetoric ooze;
21267,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And the born soldier, fate decreed to wreak"
21268,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"His martial manhood on a class in Greek,"
21269,AN ACADEMIC POEM,_Popkin_! How that explosive name recalls
21270,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The grand old Busby of our ancient halls
21271,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Such faces looked from Skippon's grim platoons,"
21272,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Such figures rode with Ireton's stout dragoons:
21273,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"He gave his strength to learning's gentle charms,"
21274,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"But every accent sounded ""Shoulder arms!"""
21275,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21276,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Names,--empty names! Save only here and there"
21277,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some white-haired listener, dozing in his chair,"
21278,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Starts at the sound he often used to hear,"
21279,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And upward slants his Sunday-sermon ear.
21280,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And we--our blooming manhood we regain;
21281,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Smiling we join the long Commencement train,"
21282,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"One point first battled in discussion hot,--"
21283,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Shall we wear gowns? and settled: We will not.
21284,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"How strange the scene,--that noisy boy-debate"
21285,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where embryo-speakers learn to rule the State!
21286,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"This broad-browed youth, sedate and sober-eyed,"
21287,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Shall wear the ermined robe at Taney's side;
21288,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And he, the stripling, smooth of face and slight,"
21289,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Whose slender form scarce intercepts the light,"
21290,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Shall rule the Bench where Parsons gave the law,"
21291,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And sphinx-like sat uncouth, majestic Shaw"
21292,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Ah, many a star has shed its fatal ray"
21293,AN ACADEMIC POEM,On names we loved--our brothers--where are they?
21294,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21295,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Nor these alone; our hearts in silence claim
21296,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Names not less dear, unsyllabled by fame."
21297,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21298,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How brief the space! and yet it sweeps us back
21299,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Far, far along our new-born history's track"
21300,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Five strides like this;--the sachem rules the land;
21301,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The Indian wigwams cluster where we stand.
21302,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21303,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The second. Lo! a scene of deadly strife--
21304,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A nation struggling into infant life;
21305,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not yet the fatal game at Yorktown won
21306,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where failing Empire fired its sunset gun.
21307,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"LANGDON sits restless in the ancient chair,--"
21308,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Harvard's grave Head,--these echoes heard his prayer"
21309,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"When from yon mansion, dear to memory still,"
21310,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The banded yeomen marched for Bunker's Hill.
21311,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Count on the grave triennial's thick-starred roll
21312,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"What names were numbered on the lengthening scroll,--"
21313,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Not unfamiliar in our ears they ring,--"
21314,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Winthrop, Hale, Eliot, Everett, Dexter, Tyng."
21315,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21316,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Another stride. Once more at 'twenty-nine,--"
21317,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"GOD SAVE KING GEORGE, the Second of his line!"
21318,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And is Sir Isaac living? Nay, not so,--"
21319,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"He followed Flainsteed two short years ago,--"
21320,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And what about the little hump-backed man
21321,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Who pleased the bygone days of good Queen Anne?
21322,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"What, Pope? another book he's just put out,--"
21323,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"""The Dunciad,""--witty, but profane, no doubt."
21324,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21325,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where's Cotton Mather? he was always here.
21326,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And so he would be, but he died last year."
21327,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Who is this preacher our Northampton claims,"
21328,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Whose rhetoric blazes with sulphureous flames
21329,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And torches stolen from Tartarean mines?
21330,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Edwards, the salamander of divines."
21331,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"A deep, strong nature, pure and undefiled;"
21332,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Faith, firm as his who stabbed his sleeping child;"
21333,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Alas for him who blindly strays apart,"
21334,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And seeking God has lost his human heart!
21335,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Fall where they might, no flying cinders caught"
21336,AN ACADEMIC POEM,These sober halls where WADSWORTH ruled and
21337,AN ACADEMIC POEM,taught.
21338,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21339,AN ACADEMIC POEM,One footstep more; the fourth receding stride
21340,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Leaves the round century on the nearer side.
21341,AN ACADEMIC POEM,GOD SAVE KING CHARLES! God knows that pleasant knave
21342,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His grace will find it hard enough to save.
21343,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Ten years and more, and now the Plague, the Fire,"
21344,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Talk of all tongues, at last begin to tire;"
21345,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"One fear prevails, all other frights forgot,--"
21346,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"White lips are whispering,--hark! The Popish Plot!"
21347,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Happy New England, from such troubles free"
21348,AN ACADEMIC POEM,In health and peace beyond the stormy sea!
21349,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"No Romish daggers threat her children's throats,"
21350,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"No gibbering nightmare mutters ""Titus Oates;"""
21351,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Philip is slain, the Quaker graves are green,"
21352,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not yet the witch has entered on the scene;
21353,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Happy our Harvard; pleased her graduates four;
21354,AN ACADEMIC POEM,URIAN OAKES the name their parchments bore.
21355,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21356,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Two centuries past, our hurried feet arrive"
21357,AN ACADEMIC POEM,At the last footprint of the scanty five;
21358,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Take the fifth stride; our wandering eyes explore
21359,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A tangled forest on a trackless shore;
21360,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Here, where we stand, the savage sorcerer howls,"
21361,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The wild cat snarls, the stealthy gray wolf prowls,"
21362,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The slouching bear, perchance the trampling moose"
21363,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Starts the brown squaw and scares her red pappoose;
21364,AN ACADEMIC POEM,At every step the lurking foe is near;
21365,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His Demons reign; God has no temple here!
21366,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21367,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Lift up your eyes! behold these pictured walls;
21368,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Look where the flood of western glory falls
21369,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes
21370,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"In ruby, saffron, azure, emerald stains;"
21371,AN ACADEMIC POEM,With reverent step the marble pavement tread
21372,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where our proud Mother's martyr-roll is read;
21373,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See the great halls that cluster, gathering round"
21374,AN ACADEMIC POEM,This lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned;
21375,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See the fair Matron in her summer bower,"
21376,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower;
21377,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Read on her standard, always in the van,"
21378,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"""TRUTH,""--the one word that makes a slave a man;"
21379,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Think whose the hands that fed her altar-fires,"
21380,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Then count the debt we owe our scholar-sires!
21381,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
21382,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Brothers, farewell! the fast declining ray"
21383,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Fades to the twilight of our golden day;
21384,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some lesson yet our wearied brains may learn,"
21385,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some leaves, perhaps, in life's thin volume turn."
21386,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How few they seem as in our waning age
21387,AN ACADEMIC POEM,We count them backwards to the title-page!
21388,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Oh let us trust with holy men of old
21389,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not all the story here begun is told;
21390,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"So the tired spirit, waiting to be freed,"
21391,AN ACADEMIC POEM,On life's last leaf with tranquil eye shall read
21392,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"By the pale glimmer of the torch reversed,"
21393,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Not Finis, but _The End of Volume First_!"

21400,MY AVIARY,
21401,MY AVIARY,"Through my north window, in the wintry weather,--"
21402,MY AVIARY,"My airy oriel on the river shore,--"
21403,MY AVIARY,I watch the sea-fowl as they flock together
21404,MY AVIARY,Where late the boatman flashed his dripping oar.
21405,MY AVIARY,
21406,MY AVIARY,"The gull, high floating, like a sloop unladen,"
21407,MY AVIARY,Lets the loose water waft him as it will;
21408,MY AVIARY,"The duck, round-breasted as a rustic maiden,"
21409,MY AVIARY,"Paddles and plunges, busy, busy still."
21410,MY AVIARY,
21411,MY AVIARY,I see the solemn gulls in council sitting
21412,MY AVIARY,"On some broad ice-floe pondering long and late,"
21413,MY AVIARY,"While overhead the home-bound ducks are flitting,"
21414,MY AVIARY,"And leave the tardy conclave in debate,"
21415,MY AVIARY,
21416,MY AVIARY,Those weighty questions in their breasts revolving
21417,MY AVIARY,"Whose deeper meaning science never learns,"
21418,MY AVIARY,"Till at some reverend elder's look dissolving,"
21419,MY AVIARY,The speechless senate silently adjourns.
21420,MY AVIARY,
21421,MY AVIARY,But when along the waves the shrill north-easter
21422,MY AVIARY,"Shrieks through the laboring coaster's shrouds ""Beware!"""
21423,MY AVIARY,"The pale bird, kindling like a Christmas feaster"
21424,MY AVIARY,"When some wild chorus shakes the vinous air,"
21425,MY AVIARY,
21426,MY AVIARY,"Flaps from the leaden wave in fierce rejoicing,"
21427,MY AVIARY,"Feels heaven's dumb lightning thrill his torpid nerves,"
21428,MY AVIARY,"Now on the blast his whistling plumage poising,"
21429,MY AVIARY,"Now wheeling, whirling in fantastic curves."
21430,MY AVIARY,
21431,MY AVIARY,"Such is our gull; a gentleman of leisure,"
21432,MY AVIARY,Less fleshed than feathered; bagged you'll find him such;
21433,MY AVIARY,His virtue silence; his employment pleasure;
21434,MY AVIARY,"Not bad to look at, and not good for much."
21435,MY AVIARY,
21436,MY AVIARY,"What of our duck? He has some high-bred cousins,--"
21437,MY AVIARY,"His Grace the Canvas-back, My Lord the Brant,--"
21438,MY AVIARY,"Anas and Anser,--both served up by dozens,"
21439,MY AVIARY,"At Boston's Rocher, half-way to Nahant."
21440,MY AVIARY,
21441,MY AVIARY,"As for himself, he seems alert and thriving,--"
21442,MY AVIARY,"Grubs up a living somehow--what, who knows?"
21443,MY AVIARY,Crabs? mussels? weeds?--Look quick! there 's one just diving!
21444,MY AVIARY,Flop! Splash! his white breast glistens--down he goes!
21445,MY AVIARY,
21446,MY AVIARY,And while he 's under--just about a minute--
21447,MY AVIARY,I take advantage of the fact to say
21448,MY AVIARY,His fishy carcase has no virtue in it
21449,MY AVIARY,The gunning idiot's worthless hire to pay.
21450,MY AVIARY,
21451,MY AVIARY,Shrewd is our bird; not easy to outwit him!
21452,MY AVIARY,Sharp is the outlook of those pin-head eyes;
21453,MY AVIARY,"Still, he is mortal and a shot may hit him,"
21454,MY AVIARY,One cannot always miss him if he tries.
21455,MY AVIARY,
21456,MY AVIARY,"He knows you! ""sportsmen"" from suburban alleys,"
21457,MY AVIARY,Stretched under seaweed in the treacherous punt;
21458,MY AVIARY,"Knows every lazy, shiftless lout that sallies"
21459,MY AVIARY,"Forth to waste powder--as he says, to ""hunt."""
21460,MY AVIARY,
21461,MY AVIARY,"I watch you with a patient satisfaction,"
21462,MY AVIARY,Well pleased to discount your predestined luck;
21463,MY AVIARY,The float that figures in your sly transaction
21464,MY AVIARY,"Will carry back a goose, but not a duck."
21465,MY AVIARY,
21466,MY AVIARY,"Look! there's a young one, dreaming not of danger;"
21467,MY AVIARY,Sees a flat log come floating down the stream;
21468,MY AVIARY,Stares undismayed upon the harmless stranger;
21469,MY AVIARY,Ah! were all strangers harmless as they seem!
21470,MY AVIARY,
21471,MY AVIARY,_Habet_! a leaden shower his breast has shattered;
21472,MY AVIARY,"Vainly he flutters, not again to rise;"
21473,MY AVIARY,His soft white plumes along the waves are scattered;
21474,MY AVIARY,Helpless the wing that braved the tempest lies.
21475,MY AVIARY,
21476,MY AVIARY,He sees his comrades high above him flying
21477,MY AVIARY,To seek their nests among the island reeds;
21478,MY AVIARY,Strong is their flight; all lonely he is lying
21479,MY AVIARY,Washed by the crimsoned water as he bleeds.
21480,MY AVIARY,
21481,MY AVIARY,"O Thou who carest for the falling sparrow,"
21482,MY AVIARY,Canst Thou the sinless sufferer's pang forget?
21483,MY AVIARY,Or is thy dread account-book's page so narrow
21484,MY AVIARY,Its one long column scores thy creatures' debt?
21485,MY AVIARY,
21486,MY AVIARY,"Poor gentle guest, by nature kindly cherished,"
21487,MY AVIARY,A world grows dark with thee in blinding death;
21488,MY AVIARY,"One little gasp--thy universe has perished,"
21489,MY AVIARY,Wrecked by the idle thief who stole thy breath!
21490,MY AVIARY,
21491,MY AVIARY,"Is this the whole sad story of creation,"
21492,MY AVIARY,"Lived by its breathing myriads o'er and o'er,--"
21493,MY AVIARY,"One glimpse of day, then black annihilation,--"
21494,MY AVIARY,A sunlit passage to a sunless shore?
21495,MY AVIARY,
21496,MY AVIARY,"Give back our faith, ye mystery-solving lynxes!"
21497,MY AVIARY,Robe us once more in heaven-aspiring creeds
21498,MY AVIARY,"Happier was dreaming Egypt with her sphinxes,"
21499,MY AVIARY,The stony convent with its cross and beads!
21500,MY AVIARY,
21501,MY AVIARY,"How often gazing where a bird reposes,"
21502,MY AVIARY,"Rocked on the wavelets, drifting with the tide,"
21503,MY AVIARY,I lose myself in strange metempsychosis

22210,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22211,THE SCHOOL-BOY,1778-1878
22212,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22213,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"THESE hallowed precincts, long to memory dear,"
22214,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Smile with fresh welcome as our feet draw near;
22215,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With softer gales the opening leaves are fanned,"
22216,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With fairer hues the kindling flowers expand,"
22217,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The rose-bush reddens with the blush of June,"
22218,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The groves are vocal with their minstrels' tune,"
22219,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The mighty elm, beneath whose arching shade"
22220,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The wandering children of the forest strayed,"
22221,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Greets the bright morning in its bridal dress,"
22222,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And spreads its arms the gladsome dawn to bless.
22223,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is it an idle dream that nature shares
22224,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Our joys, our griefs, our pastimes, and our cares?"
22225,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Is there no summons when, at morning's call,"
22226,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The sable vestments of the darkness fall?
22227,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Does not meek evening's low-voiced Ave blend
22228,THE SCHOOL-BOY,With the soft vesper as its notes ascend?
22229,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is there no whisper in the perfumed air
22230,THE SCHOOL-BOY,When the sweet bosom of the rose is bare?
22231,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Does not the sunshine call us to rejoice?
22232,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is there no meaning in the storm-cloud's voice?
22233,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No silent message when from midnight skies
22234,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Heaven looks upon us with its myriad eyes?
22235,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22236,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Or shift the mirror; say our dreams diffuse
22237,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"O'er life's pale landscape their celestial hues,"
22238,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Lend heaven the rainbow it has never known,"
22239,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And robe the earth in glories not its own,"
22240,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Sing their own music in the summer breeze,"
22241,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With fresher foliage clothe the stately trees,"
22242,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Stain the June blossoms with a livelier dye
22243,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And spread a bluer azure on the sky,--"
22244,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Blest be the power that works its lawless will
22245,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And finds the weediest patch an Eden still;
22246,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No walls so fair as those our fancies build,--"
22247,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No views so bright as those our visions gild!
22248,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22249,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So ran my lines, as pen and paper met,"
22250,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The truant goose-quill travelling like Planchette;
22251,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Too ready servant, whose deceitful ways"
22252,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Full many a slipshod line, alas! betrays;"
22253,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Hence of the rhyming thousand not a few
22254,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Have builded worse--a great deal--than they knew.
22255,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22256,THE SCHOOL-BOY,What need of idle fancy to adorn
22257,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Our mother's birthplace on her birthday morn?
22258,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hers are the blossoms of eternal spring,"
22259,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From these green boughs her new-fledged birds take wing,"
22260,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These echoes hear their earliest carols sung,"
22261,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In this old nest the brood is ever young.
22262,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If some tired wanderer, resting from his flight,"
22263,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Amid the gay young choristers alight,"
22264,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These gather round him, mark his faded plumes"
22265,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"That faintly still the far-off grove perfumes,"
22266,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And listen, wondering if some feeble note"
22267,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yet lingers, quavering in his weary throat:--"
22268,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I, whose fresh voice yon red-faced temple knew,"
22269,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"What tune is left me, fit to sing to you?"
22270,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Ask not the grandeurs of a labored song,"
22271,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But let my easy couplets slide along;
22272,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Much could I tell you that you know too well;
22273,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Much I remember, but I will not tell;"
22274,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Age brings experience; graybeards oft are wise,"
22275,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But oh! how sharp a youngster's ears and eyes!
22276,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22277,THE SCHOOL-BOY,My cheek was bare of adolescent down
22278,THE SCHOOL-BOY,When first I sought the academic town;
22279,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Slow rolls the coach along the dusty road,"
22280,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Big with its filial and parental load;
22281,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The frequent hills, the lonely woods are past,"
22282,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The school-boy's chosen home is reached at last.
22283,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I see it now, the same unchanging spot,"
22284,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The swinging gate, the little garden plot,"
22285,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The narrow yard, the rock that made its floor,"
22286,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The flat, pale house, the knocker-garnished door,"
22287,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The small, trim parlor, neat, decorous, chill,"
22288,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The strange, new faces, kind, but grave and still;"
22289,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Two, creased with age,--or what I then called age,--"
22290,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Life's volume open at its fiftieth page;
22291,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One, a shy maiden's, pallid, placid, sweet"
22292,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"As the first snow-drop, which the sunbeams greet;"
22293,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One, the last nursling's; slight she was, and fair,"
22294,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her smooth white forehead warmed with auburn hair;
22295,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Last came the virgin Hymen long had spared,"
22296,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose daily cares the grateful household shared,"
22297,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Strong, patient, humble; her substantial frame"
22298,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Stretched the chaste draperies I forbear to name.
22299,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Brave, but with effort, had the school-boy come"
22300,THE SCHOOL-BOY,To the cold comfort of a stranger's home;
22301,THE SCHOOL-BOY,How like a dagger to my sinking heart
22302,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Came the dry summons, ""It is time to part;"
22303,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Good-by!"" ""Goo-ood-by!"" one fond maternal kiss. . . ."
22304,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Homesick as death! Was ever pang like this?
22305,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Too young as yet with willing feet to stray
22306,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From the tame fireside, glad to get away,--"
22307,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Too old to let my watery grief appear,--"
22308,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And what so bitter as a swallowed tear!
22309,THE SCHOOL-BOY,One figure still my vagrant thoughts pursue;
22310,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"First boy to greet me, Ariel, where are you?"
22311,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Imp of all mischief, heaven alone knows how"
22312,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"You learned it all,--are you an angel now,"
22313,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or tottering gently down the slope of years,"
22314,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Your face grown sober in the vale of tears?
22315,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Forgive my freedom if you are breathing still;
22316,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22317,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If in a happier world, I know you will."
22318,THE SCHOOL-BOY,You were a school-boy--what beneath the sun
22319,THE SCHOOL-BOY,So like a monkey? I was also one.
22320,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Strange, sure enough, to see what curious shoots"
22321,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The nursery raises from the study's roots!
22322,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"In those old days the very, very good"
22323,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Took up more room--a little--than they should;
22324,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Something too much one's eyes encountered then
22325,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Of serious youth and funeral-visaged men;
22326,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The solemn elders saw life's mournful half,--"
22327,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Heaven sent this boy, whose mission was to laugh,"
22328,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Drollest of buffos, Nature's odd protest,"
22329,THE SCHOOL-BOY,A catbird squealing in a blackbird's nest.
22330,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Kind, faithful Nature! While the sour-eyed Scot--"
22331,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her cheerful smiles forbidden or forgot--
22332,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Talks only of his preacher and his kirk,--"
22333,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hears five-hour sermons for his Sunday work,--"
22334,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Praying and fasting till his meagre face
22335,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Gains its due length, the genuine sign of grace,--"
22336,THE SCHOOL-BOY,An Ayrshire mother in the land of Knox
22337,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her embryo poet in his cradle rocks;--
22338,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Nature, long shivering in her dim eclipse,"
22339,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Steals in a sunbeam to those baby lips;
22340,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So to its home her banished smile returns,"
22341,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And Scotland sweetens with the song of Burns!
22342,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22343,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The morning came; I reached the classic hall;
22344,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A clock-face eyed me, staring from the wall;"
22345,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Beneath its hands a printed line I read
22346,THE SCHOOL-BOY,YOUTH IS LIFE'S SEED-TIME: so the clock-face said:
22347,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some took its counsel, as the sequel showed,--"
22348,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Sowed,--their wild oats,--and reaped as they had sowed."
22349,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"How all comes back! the upward slanting floor,--"
22350,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The masters' thrones that flank the central door,--"
22351,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The long, outstretching alleys that divide"
22352,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The rows of desks that stand on either side,--"
22353,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The staring boys, a face to every desk,"
22354,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Bright, dull, pale, blooming, common, picturesque."
22355,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Grave is the Master's look; his forehead wears
22356,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Thick rows of wrinkles, prints of worrying cares;"
22357,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Uneasy lie the heads of all that rule,"
22358,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His most of all whose kingdom is a school.
22359,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Supreme he sits; before the awful frown
22360,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That bends his brows the boldest eye goes down;
22361,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Not more submissive Israel heard and saw
22362,THE SCHOOL-BOY,At Sinai's foot the Giver of the Law.
22363,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Less stern he seems, who sits in equal Mate"
22364,THE SCHOOL-BOY,On the twin throne and shares the empire's weight;
22365,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Around his lips the subtle life that plays
22366,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Steals quaintly forth in many a jesting phrase;
22367,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A lightsome nature, not so hard to chafe,"
22368,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Pleasant when pleased; rough-handled, not so safe;"
22369,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some tingling memories vaguely I recall,"
22370,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But to forgive him. God forgive us all!
22371,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22372,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One yet remains, whose well-remembered name"
22373,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Pleads in my grateful heart its tender claim;
22374,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His was the charm magnetic, the bright look"
22375,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That sheds its sunshine on the dreariest book;
22376,THE SCHOOL-BOY,A loving soul to every task he brought
22377,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That sweetly mingled with the lore he taught;
22378,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Sprung from a saintly race that never could
22379,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From youth to age be anything but good,"
22380,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His few brief years in holiest labors spent,"
22381,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Earth lost too soon the treasure heaven had lent.
22382,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Kindest of teachers, studious to divine"
22383,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some hint of promise in my earliest line,"
22384,THE SCHOOL-BOY,These faint and faltering words thou canst not hear
22385,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Throb from a heart that holds thy memory dear.
22386,THE SCHOOL-BOY,As to the traveller's eye the varied plain
22387,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Shows through the window of the flying train,"
22388,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A mingled landscape, rather felt than seen,"
22389,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A gravelly bank, a sudden flash of green,"
22390,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A tangled wood, a glittering stream that flows"
22391,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Through the cleft summit where the cliff once rose,"
22392,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"All strangely blended in a hurried gleam,"
22393,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Rock, wood, waste, meadow, village, hill-side, stream,--"
22394,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So, as we look behind us, life appears,"
22395,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Seen through the vista of our bygone years.
22396,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yet in the dead past's shadow-filled domain,"
22397,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Some vanished shapes the hues of life retain;
22398,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Unbidden, oft, before our dreaming eyes"
22399,THE SCHOOL-BOY,From the vague mists in memory's path they rise.
22400,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So comes his blooming image to my view,"
22401,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The friend of joyous days when life was new,"
22402,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hope yet untamed, the blood of youth unchilled,"
22403,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No blank arrear of promise unfulfilled,"
22404,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Life's flower yet hidden in its sheltering fold,"
22405,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Its pictured canvas yet to be unrolled.
22406,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His the frank smile I vainly look to greet,"
22407,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His the warm grasp my clasping hand should meet;
22408,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"How would our lips renew their school-boy talk,"
22409,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Our feet retrace the old familiar walk!
22410,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For thee no more earth's cheerful morning shines
22411,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Through the green fringes of the tented pines;
22412,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Ah me! is heaven so far thou canst not hear,"
22413,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or is thy viewless spirit hovering near,"
22414,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A fair young presence, bright with morning's glow,"
22415,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The fresh-cheeked boy of fifty years ago?
22416,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yes, fifty years, with all their circling suns,"
22417,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Behind them all my glance reverted runs;
22418,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where now that time remote, its griefs, its joys,"
22419,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where are its gray-haired men, its bright-haired boys?"
22420,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where is the patriarch time could hardly tire,--"
22421,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The good old, wrinkled, immemorial ""squire ""?"
22422,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"(An honest treasurer, like a black-plumed swan,"
22423,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Not every day our eyes may look upon.)
22424,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the tough champion who, with Calvin's sword,"
22425,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In wordy conflicts battled for the Lord?
22426,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the grave scholar, lonely, calm, austere,"
22427,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose voice like music charmed the listening ear,"
22428,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose light rekindled, like the morning star"
22429,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Still shines upon us through the gates ajar?
22430,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the still, solemn, weary, sad-eyed man,"
22431,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose care-worn face and wandering eyes would scan,--"
22432,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His features wasted in the lingering strife
22433,THE SCHOOL-BOY,With the pale foe that drains the student's life?
22434,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where my old friend, the scholar, teacher, saint,"
22435,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose creed, some hinted, showed a speck of taint;"
22436,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"He broached his own opinion, which is not"
22437,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Lightly to be forgiven or forgot;
22438,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some riddle's point,--I scarce remember now,--"
22439,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Homoi-, perhaps, where they said homo-ou."
22440,THE SCHOOL-BOY,(If the unlettered greatly wish to know
22441,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where lies the difference betwixt oi and o,"
22442,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Those of the curious who have time may search
22443,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Among the stale conundrums of their church.)
22444,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Beneath his roof his peaceful life I shared,"
22445,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And for his modes of faith I little cared,--"
22446,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I, taught to judge men's dogmas by their deeds,"
22447,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Long ere the days of india-rubber creeds.
22448,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22449,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Why should we look one common faith to find,"
22450,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Where one in every score is color-blind?
22451,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If here on earth they know not red from green,"
22452,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Will they see better into things unseen!
22453,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Once more to time's old graveyard I return
22454,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And scrape the moss from memory's pictured urn.
22455,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Who, in these days when all things go by steam,"
22456,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Recalls the stage-coach with its four-horse team?
22457,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Its sturdy driver,--who remembers him?"
22458,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or the old landlord, saturnine and grim,"
22459,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Who left our hill-top for a new abode
22460,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And reared his sign-post farther down the road?
22461,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Still in the waters of the dark Shawshine
22462,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Do the young bathers splash and think they're clean?
22463,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Do pilgrims find their way to Indian Ridge,"
22464,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or journey onward to the far-off bridge,"
22465,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And bring to younger ears the story back
22466,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Of the broad stream, the mighty Merrimac?"
22467,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Are there still truant feet that stray beyond
22468,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These circling bounds to Pomp's or Haggett's Pond,"
22469,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Or where the legendary name recalls
22470,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The forest's earlier tenant,--""Deerjump Falls""?"
22471,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yes, every nook these youthful feet explore,"
22472,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Just as our sires and grand sires did of yore;
22473,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So all life's opening paths, where nature led"
22474,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Their father's feet, the children's children tread."
22475,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Roll the round century's fivescore years away,"
22476,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Call from our storied past that earliest day
22477,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"When great Eliphalet (I can see him now,--"
22478,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Big name, big frame, big voice, and beetling brow),"
22479,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Then young Eliphalet,--ruled the rows of boys"
22480,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"In homespun gray or old-world corduroys,--"
22481,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And save for fashion's whims, the benches show"
22482,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The self-same youths, the very boys we know."
22483,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Time works strange marvels: since I trod the green
22484,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And swung the gates, what wonders I have seen!"
22485,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"But come what will,--the sky itself may fall,--"
22486,THE SCHOOL-BOY,As things of course the boy accepts them all.
22487,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The prophet's chariot, drawn by steeds of flame,"
22488,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For daily use our travelling millions claim;
22489,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The face we love a sunbeam makes our own;
22490,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No more the surgeon hears the sufferer's groan;
22491,THE SCHOOL-BOY,What unwrit histories wrapped in darkness lay
22492,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Till shovelling Schliemann bared them to the day!
22493,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Your Richelieu says, and says it well, my lord,"
22494,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The pen is (sometimes) mightier than the sword;
22495,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Great is the goosequill, say we all; Amen!"
22496,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Sometimes the spade is mightier than the pen;
22497,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"It shows where Babel's terraced walls were raised,"
22498,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The slabs that cracked when Nimrod's palace blazed,"
22499,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Unearths Mycenee, rediscovers Troy,--"

22505,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So swift, in truth, we hardly find a place"
22506,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For those dim fictions known as time and space.
22507,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Still a new miracle each year supplies,--"
22508,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"See at his work the chemist of the skies,"
22509,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Who questions Sirius in his tortured rays
22510,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And steals the secret of the solar blaze;
22511,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Hush! while the window-rattling bugles play
22512,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The nation's airs a hundred miles away!
22513,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That wicked phonograph! hark! how it swears!
22514,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Turn it again and make it say its prayers!
22515,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And was it true, then, what the story said"
22516,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Of Oxford's friar and his brazen head?
22517,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"While wondering Science stands, herself perplexed"
22518,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"At each day's miracle, and asks ""What next?"""

22520,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Springs from his desk to ""urge the flying ball,"""
22521,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Cleaves with his bending oar the glassy waves,"
22522,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With sinewy arm the dashing current braves,"

22524,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"That Eton shadowed with her ""antique towers."""
22525,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22526,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Boy! Where is he? the long-limbed youth inquires,"
22527,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Whom his rough chin with manly pride inspires;

22529,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"When the bright hair is white as winter snows,"
22530,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"When the dim eye has lost its lambent flame,"
22531,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Sweet to his ear will be his school-boy name
22532,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Nor think the difference mighty as it seems
22533,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Between life's morning and its evening dreams;
22534,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Fourscore, like twenty, has its tasks and toys;"
22535,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In earth's wide school-house all are girls and boys.
22536,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22537,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Brothers, forgive my wayward fancy. Who"
22538,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Can guess beforehand what his pen will do?
22539,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Too light my strain for listeners such as these,"
22540,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Whom graver thoughts and soberer speech shall please.
22541,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is he not here whose breath of holy song
22542,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Has raised the downcast eyes of Faith so long?
22543,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Are they not here, the strangers in your gates,"
22544,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"For whom the wearied ear impatient waits,--"
22545,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The large-brained scholars whom their toils release,--"
22546,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The bannered heralds of the Prince of Peace?
22547,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22548,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Such was the gentle friend whose youth unblamed
22549,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In years long past our student-benches claimed;
22550,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose name, illumined on the sacred page,"
22551,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Lives in the labors of his riper age;
22552,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Such he whose record time's destroying march
22553,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Leaves uneffaced on Zion's springing arch
22554,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Not to the scanty phrase of measured song,"
22555,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Cramped in its fetters, names like these belong;"
22556,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One ray they lend to gild my slender line,--"
22557,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Their praise I leave to sweeter lips than mine.
22558,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22559,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Homes of our sires, where Learning's temple rose,"
22560,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"While vet they struggled with their banded foes,"
22561,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"As in the West thy century's sun descends,"
22562,THE SCHOOL-BOY,One parting gleam its dying radiance lends.
22563,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Darker and deeper though the shadows fall
22564,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From the gray towers on Doubting Castle's wall,"
22565,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Though Pope and Pagan re-array their hosts,"
22566,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And her new armor youthful Science boasts,"
22567,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Truth, for whose altar rose this holy shrine,"
22568,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine;
22569,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No past shall chain her with its rusted vow,"
22570,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No Jew's phylactery bind her Christian brow,"
22571,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"But Faith shall smile to find her sister free,"
22572,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And nobler manhood draw its life from thee.
22573,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
22574,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Long as the arching skies above thee spread,"
22575,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"As on thy groves the dews of heaven are shed,"
22576,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With currents widening still from year to year,"
22577,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And deepening channels, calm, untroubled, clear,"
22578,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Flow the twin streamlets from thy sacred hill--
22579,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Pieria's fount and Siloam's shaded rill!

22601,THE SILENT MELODY,"""But on them Time too long has played"
22602,THE SILENT MELODY,"The solemn strain that knows no change,"

22605,THE SILENT MELODY,"Yes! iron strings,--I know,--I know,--"
22606,THE SILENT MELODY,We both are wrecks of long ago.
22607,THE SILENT MELODY,
22608,THE SILENT MELODY,"""We both are wrecks,--a shattered pair,--"
22609,THE SILENT MELODY,Strange to ourselves in time's disguise.
22610,THE SILENT MELODY,What say ye to the lovesick air
22611,THE SILENT MELODY,That brought the tears from Marian's eyes?
22612,THE SILENT MELODY,"Ay! trust me,--under breasts of snow"

22614,THE SILENT MELODY,

22619,THE SILENT MELODY,"Wrecks,--nought but wrecks!--the time was when"
22620,THE SILENT MELODY,"We two were worth a thousand men!"""
22621,THE SILENT MELODY,
22622,THE SILENT MELODY,And so the broken harp they bring
22623,THE SILENT MELODY,With pitying smiles that none could blame;
22624,THE SILENT MELODY,Alas! there's not a single string
22625,THE SILENT MELODY,Of all that filled the tarnished frame!
22626,THE SILENT MELODY,"But see! like children overjoyed,"
22627,THE SILENT MELODY,His fingers rambling through the void!
22628,THE SILENT MELODY,
22629,THE SILENT MELODY,"""I clasp thee! Ay . . . mine ancient lyre . . ."
22630,THE SILENT MELODY,"Nay, guide my wandering fingers. . . There"
22631,THE SILENT MELODY,They love to dally with the wire
22632,THE SILENT MELODY,As Isaac played with Esau's hair.
22633,THE SILENT MELODY,Hush! ye shall hear the famous tune
22634,THE SILENT MELODY,"That Marian called the Breath of June!"""
22635,THE SILENT MELODY,
22636,THE SILENT MELODY,And so they softly gather round
22637,THE SILENT MELODY,Rapt in his tuneful trance he seems
22638,THE SILENT MELODY,His fingers move: but not a sound!
22639,THE SILENT MELODY,A silence like the song of dreams. . . .
22640,THE SILENT MELODY,"""There! ye have heard the air,"" he cries,"
22641,THE SILENT MELODY,"""That brought the tears from Marian's eyes!"""
22642,THE SILENT MELODY,
22643,THE SILENT MELODY,"Ah, smile not at his fond conceit,"

22646,THE SILENT MELODY,No discord mars the silent strain

23045,AT MY FIRESIDE,"ALONE, beneath the darkened sky,"
23046,AT MY FIRESIDE,"With saddened heart and unstrung lyre,"
23047,AT MY FIRESIDE,"I heap the spoils of years gone by,"
23048,AT MY FIRESIDE,"And leave them with a long-drawn sigh,"
23049,AT MY FIRESIDE,"Like drift-wood brands that glimmering lie,"
23050,AT MY FIRESIDE,Before the ashes hide the fire.
23051,AT MY FIRESIDE,
23052,AT MY FIRESIDE,Let not these slow declining days
23053,AT MY FIRESIDE,The rosy light of dawn outlast;

23055,AT MY FIRESIDE,"And gilds the east with borrowed rays,"

23065,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB
23066,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,THIS is our place of meeting; opposite
23067,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,That towered and pillared building: look at it;
23068,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"King's Chapel in the Second George's day,"
23069,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Rebellion stole its regal name away,--"
23070,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Stone Chapel sounded better; but at last
23071,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The poisoned name of our provincial past
23072,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Had lost its ancient venom; then once more
23073,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Stone Chapel was King's Chapel as before.
23074,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"(So let rechristened North Street, when it can,"
23075,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Bring back the days of Marlborough and Queen Anne!)
23076,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Next the old church your wandering eye will meet--
23077,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,A granite pile that stares upon the street--
23078,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Our civic temple; slanderous tongues have said
23079,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Its shape was modelled from St. Botolph's head,"
23080,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Lofty, but narrow; jealous passers-by"
23081,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Say Boston always held her head too high.
23082,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Turn half-way round, and let your look survey"
23083,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The white facade that gleams across the way,--"
23084,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The many-windowed building, tall and wide,"
23085,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The palace-inn that shows its northern side
23086,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,In grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat
23087,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The granite wall in summer's scorching heat.
23088,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,This is the place; whether its name you spell
23089,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Tavern, or caravansera, or hotel."
23090,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Would I could steal its echoes! you should find
23091,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind
23092,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such feasts! the laughs of many a jocund hour
23093,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,That shook the mortar from King George's tower;
23094,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Such guests! What famous names its record boasts,"
23095,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts!
23096,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such stories! Every beam and plank is filled
23097,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"With juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled,"
23098,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Ready to ooze, as once the mountain pine"
23099,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The floors are laid with oozed its turpentine!
23100,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23101,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,A month had flitted since The Club had met;
23102,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The day came round; I found the table set,"
23103,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The waiters lounging round the marble stairs,"
23104,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Empty as yet the double row of chairs.
23105,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"I was a full half hour before the rest,"
23106,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Alone, the banquet-chamber's single guest."
23107,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"So from the table's side a chair I took,"
23108,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And having neither company nor book
23109,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"To keep me waking, by degrees there crept"
23110,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"A torpor over me,--in short, I slept."
23111,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23112,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Loosed from its chain, along the wreck-strown track"
23113,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of the dead years my soul goes travelling back;
23114,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,My ghosts take on their robes of flesh; it seems
23115,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dreaming is life; nay, life less life than dreams,"
23116,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,So real are the shapes that meet my eyes.
23117,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"They bring no sense of wonder, no surprise,"
23118,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,No hint of other than an earth-born source;
23119,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"All seems plain daylight, everything of course."
23120,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23121,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How dim the colors are, how poor and faint"
23122,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,This palette of weak words with which I paint!
23123,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Here sit my friends; if I could fix them so
23124,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"As to my eyes they seem, my page would glow"
23125,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Like a queen's missal, warm as if the brush"
23126,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of Titian or Velasquez brought the flush
23127,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of life into their features. Ay de mi!
23128,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"If syllables were pigments, you should see"
23129,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such breathing portraitures as never man
23130,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Found in the Pitti or the Vatican.
23131,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23132,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Here sits our POET, Laureate, if you will."
23133,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Long has he worn the wreath, and wears it still."
23134,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dead? Nay, not so; and yet they say his bust"
23135,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Looks down on marbles covering royal dust,"
23136,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Kings by the Grace of God, or Nature's grace;"
23137,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dead! No! Alive! I see him in his place,"
23138,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Full-featured, with the bloom that heaven denies"
23139,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Her children, pinched by cold New England skies,"
23140,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Too often, while the nursery's happier few"
23141,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Win from a summer cloud its roseate hue.
23142,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Kind, soft-voiced, gentle, in his eye there shines"
23143,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The ray serene that filled Evangeline's.
23144,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Modest he seems, not shy; content to wait"
23145,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Amid the noisy clamor of debate
23146,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The looked-for moment when a peaceful word
23147,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred.
23148,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,In every tone I mark his tender grace
23149,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And all his poems hinted in his face;
23150,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,What tranquil joy his friendly presence gives!
23151,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,How could. I think him dead? He lives! He lives!
23152,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23153,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"There, at the table's further end I see"
23154,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In his old place our Poet's vis-a-vis,"
23155,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The great PROFESSOR, strong, broad-shouldered, square,"
23156,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In life's rich noontide, joyous, debonair."
23157,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"His social hour no leaden care alloys,"
23158,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"His laugh rings loud and mirthful as a boy's,--"
23159,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"That lusty laugh the Puritan forgot,--"
23160,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,What ear has heard it and remembers not?
23161,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How often, halting at some wide crevasse"
23162,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Amid the windings of his Alpine pass,"
23163,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"High up the cliffs, the climbing mountaineer,"
23164,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Listening the far-off avalanche to hear,"
23165,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Silent, and leaning on his steel-shod staff,"
23166,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Has heard that cheery voice, that ringing laugh,"
23167,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,From the rude cabin whose nomadic walls
23168,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Creep with the moving glacier as it crawls
23169,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,How does vast Nature lead her living train
23170,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In ordered sequence through that spacious brain,"
23171,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,As in the primal hour when Adam named
23172,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The new-born tribes that young creation claimed!--
23173,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How will her realm be darkened, losing thee,"
23174,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Her darling, whom we call _our_ AGASSIZ!"
23175,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23176,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,But who is he whose massive frame belies
23177,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The maiden shyness of his downcast eyes?
23178,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Who broods in silence till, by questions pressed,"
23179,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Some answer struggles from his laboring breast?
23180,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"An artist Nature meant to dwell apart,"
23181,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Locked in his studio with a human heart,"
23182,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Tracking its eaverned passions to their lair,"
23183,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And all its throbbing mysteries laying bare.
23184,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Count it no marvel that he broods alone
23185,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Over the heart he studies,--'t is his own;"
23186,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"So in his page, whatever shape it wear,"
23187,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The Essex wizard's shadowed self is there,--"
23188,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The great ROMANCER, hid beneath his veil"
23189,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Like the stern preacher of his sombre tale;
23190,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Virile in strength, yet bashful as a girl,"
23191,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Prouder than Hester, sensitive as Pearl."
23192,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23193,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"From his mild throng of worshippers released,"
23194,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Our Concord Delphi sends its chosen priest,"
23195,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Prophet or poet, mystic, sage, or seer,"
23196,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,By every title always welcome here.
23197,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Why that ethereal spirit's frame describe?
23198,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"You know the race-marks of the Brahmin tribe,"
23199,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The spare, slight form, the sloping shoulders' droop,"
23200,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The calm, scholastic mien, the clerkly stoop,"
23201,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The lines of thought the sharpened features wear,"
23202,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Carved by the edge of keen New England air.
23203,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,List! for he speaks! As when a king would choose
23204,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The jewels for his bride, he might refuse"
23205,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"This diamond for its flaw,--find that less bright"
23206,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Than those, its fellows, and a pearl less white"
23207,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Than fits her snowy neck, and yet at last,"
23208,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The fairest gems are chosen, and made fast"
23209,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In golden fetters; so, with light delays"
23210,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,He seeks the fittest word to fill his phrase;
23211,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Nor vain nor idle his fastidious quest,"
23212,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,His chosen word is sure to prove the best.
23213,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Where in the realm of thought, whose air is song,"
23214,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Does he, the Buddha of the West, belong?"
23215,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"He seems a winged Franklin, sweetly wise,"
23216,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Born to unlock the secrets of the skies;
23217,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"And which the nobler calling,--if 't is fair"
23218,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Terrestrial with celestial to compare,--"
23219,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"To guide the storm-cloud's elemental flame,"
23220,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Or walk the chambers whence the lightning came,"
23221,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Amidst the sources of its subtile fire,"
23222,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And steal their effluence for his lips and lyre?
23223,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"If lost at times in vague aerial flights,"
23224,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,None treads with firmer footstep when he lights;
23225,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"A soaring nature, ballasted with sense,"
23226,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Wisdom without her wrinkles or pretence,"
23227,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In every Bible he has faith to read,"
23228,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And every altar helps to shape his creed.
23229,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Ask you what name this prisoned spirit bears
23230,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,While with ourselves this fleeting breath it shares?
23231,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Till angels greet him with a sweeter one
23232,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In heaven, on earth we call him EMERSON."
23233,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
23234,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,I start; I wake; the vision is withdrawn;
23235,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Its figures fading like the stars at dawn;
23236,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Crossed from the roll of life their cherished names,"
23237,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And memory's pictures fading in their frames;
23238,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Yet life is lovelier for these transient gleams
23239,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of buried friendships; blest is he who dreams!

23714,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,I see in state the long procession pass
23715,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Tall, courtly, leader as by right divine,"
23716,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Winthrop, our Winthrop, rules the marshalled line,"
23717,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Still seen in front, as on that far-off day"
23718,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,His ribboned baton showed the column's way.
23719,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all are gone who marched in manly pride
23720,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And waved their truncheons at their leader's side;
23721,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Gray, Lowell, Dixwell, who his empire shared,"
23722,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,These to be with us envious Time has spared.
23723,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23724,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Few are the faces, so familiar then,"
23725,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Our eyes still meet amid the haunts of men;
23726,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Scarce one of all the living gathered there,"
23727,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose unthinned locks betrayed a silver hair,"
23728,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Greets us to-day, and yet we seem the same"
23729,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As our own sires and grandsires, save in name."
23730,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"There are the patriarchs, looking vaguely round"
23731,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"For classmates' faces, hardly known if found;"
23732,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,See the cold brow that rules the busy mart;
23733,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Close at its side the pallid son of art,"
23734,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose purchased skill with borrowed meaning clothes,"
23735,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And stolen hues, the smirking face he loathes."
23736,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Here is the patient scholar; in his looks
23737,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,You read the titles of his learned books;
23738,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What classic lore those spidery crow's-feet speak!
23739,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What problems figure on that wrinkled cheek!
23740,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"For never thought but left its stiffened trace,"
23741,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Its fossil footprint, on the plastic face,"
23742,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As the swift record of a raindrop stands,"
23743,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Fixed on the tablet of the hardening sands.
23744,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,On every face as on the written page
23745,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Each year renews the autograph of age;
23746,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"One trait alone may wasting years defy,--"

23748,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While Hope, the siren, sings her sweetest strain,--"
23749,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,_Non omnis moriar_ is its proud refrain.
23750,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23751,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Sadly we gaze upon the vacant chair;

23753,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Otis, whose lips the listening crowd enthrall"
23754,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That press and pack the floor of Boston's hall.
23755,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But Kirkland smiles, released from toil and care"

23772,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23773,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Look on that form,--with eye dilating scan"
23774,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The stately mould of nature's kingliest man!
23775,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Tower-like he stands in life's unfaded prime;
23776,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Ask you his name? None asks a second time
23777,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"He from the land his outward semblance takes,"
23778,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where storm-swept mountains watch o'er slumbering lakes.
23779,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,See in the impress which the body wears
23780,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How its imperial might the soul declares
23781,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The forehead's large expansion, lofty, wide,"
23782,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That locks unsilvered vainly strive to hide;
23783,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The lines of thought that plough the sober cheek;
23784,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Lips that betray their wisdom ere they speak
23785,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In tones like answers from Dodona's grove;
23786,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,An eye like Juno's when she frowns on Jove.
23787,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,I look and wonder; will he be content--
23788,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"This man, this monarch, for the purple meant--"
23789,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The meaner duties of his tribe to share,"
23790,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Clad in the garb that common mortals wear?
23791,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ah, wild Ambition, spread thy restless wings,"
23792,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Beneath whose plumes the hidden cestrum stings;
23793,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23794,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thou whose bold flight would leave earth's vulgar crowds,"
23795,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And like the eagle soar above the clouds,"
23796,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Must feel the pang that fallen angels know
23797,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When the red lightning strikes thee from below!
23798,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23799,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Less bronze, more silver, mingles in the mould"
23800,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of him whom next my roving eyes behold;
23801,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"His, more the scholar's than the statesman's face,"
23802,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Proclaims him born of academic race.
23803,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Weary his look, as if an aching brain"
23804,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Left on his brow the frozen prints of pain;
23805,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"His voice far-reaching, grave, sonorous, owns"
23806,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A shade of sadness in its plaintive tones,"
23807,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires
23808,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Glows with a heat that every bosom fires.
23809,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Such Everett seems; no chance-sown wild flower knows
23810,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The full-blown charms of culture's double rose,--"
23811,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Alas, how soon, by death's unsparing frost,"
23812,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost!
23813,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23814,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Two voices, only two, to earth belong,"

23826,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23827,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What were the glory of these festal days

23834,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Till all is glorious as the noonday sun.
23835,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23836,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How to the scholar's mind each object brings
23837,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"What some historian tells, some poet sings!"

23839,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Loved, honored, laughed at, and by freshmen feared,"
23840,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As from old ""Harvard,"" where its light began,"
23841,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From hall to hall the clustering splendors ran--
23842,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Took down his well-worn Eschylus and read,"
23843,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Lit by the rays a thousand tapers shed,"
23844,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How the swift herald crossed the leagues between
23845,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Mycenae's monarch and his faithless queen;

23861,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23862,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So ends the day; before the midnight stroke
23863,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The lights expiring cloud the air with smoke;
23864,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While these the toil of younger hands employ,"
23865,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The slumbering Grecian dreams of smouldering Troy.
23866,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23867,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As to that hour with backward steps I turn,"
23868,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Midway I pause; behold a funeral urn!
23869,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ah, sad memorial! known but all too well"
23870,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The tale which thus its golden letters tell:
23871,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23872,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"This dust, once breathing, changed its joyous life"

23874,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Love, friendship, learning's all prevailing charms,"
23875,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,For the cold bivouac and the clash of arms.
23876,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The cause of freedom won, a race enslaved"
23877,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Called back to manhood, and a nation saved,"
23878,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These sons of Harvard, falling ere their prime,"
23879,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Leave their proud memory to the coming time.
23880,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23881,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While in their still retreats our scholars turn
23882,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The mildewed pages of the past, to learn"
23883,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,With endless labor of the sleepless brain
23884,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"What once has been and ne'er shall be again,"
23885,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,We reap the harvest of their ceaseless toil
23886,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And find a fragrance in their midnight oil.

23889,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The world reminds him, with a scornful laugh,"
23890,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That times have changed since Prospero broke his staff.

23892,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The dismal hour when Lisbon shook and fell,"
23893,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Or name the shuddering night that toppled down
23894,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Our sister's pride, beneath whose mural crown"
23895,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Scarce had the scowl forgot its angry lines,"

23897,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23898,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"New realms, new worlds, exulting Science claims,"
23899,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Still the dim future unexplored remains;

23902,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We know what ores the fires of Sirius melt,"

23904,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Angels, archangels, may have yet to learn"
23905,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those hidden truths our heaven-taught eyes discern;
23906,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Yet vain is Knowledge, with her mystic wand,"
23907,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To pierce the cloudy screen and read beyond;
23908,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Once to the silent stars the fates were known,"
23909,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To us they tell no secrets but their own.
23910,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23911,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"At Israel's altar still we humbly bow,"
23912,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But where, oh where, are Israel's prophets now?"
23913,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where is the sibyl with her hoarded leaves?

23918,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Unseen, unheard, unheralded, they come,"
23919,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Prophet and priest and all their following fail.
23920,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Who then is left to rend the future's veil?

23925,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Who, while the storm-wind waits its darkening shroud,"
23926,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Foretells the tempest ere he sees the cloud,--"
23927,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Stays not for time his secrets to reveal,"
23928,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,But reads his message ere he breaks the seal.
23929,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So Mantua's bard foretold the coming day
23930,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Ere Bethlehem's infant in the manger lay;
23931,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The promise trusted to a mortal tongue
23932,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Found listening ears before the angels sung.
23933,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"So while his load the creeping pack-horse galled,"

23939,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23940,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Happy the poet! him no tyrant fact

23945,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"He rules o'er shadows, but he reigns alone."
23946,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Shall I the poet's broad dominion claim
23947,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Because you bid me wear his sacred name

23949,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"My flint and steel, and by the sudden flash"
23950,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Read the fair vision which my soul descries
23951,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Through the wide pupils of its wondering eyes?
23952,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,List then awhile; the fifty years have sped;
23953,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The third full century's opened scroll is spread,"
23954,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Blank to all eyes save his who dimly sees
23955,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The shadowy future told in words like these.
23956,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23957,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"How strange the prospect to my sight appears,"
23958,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Changed by the busy hands of fifty years!
23959,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Full well I know our ocean-salted Charles,"
23960,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Filling and emptying through the sands and marls
23961,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"That wall his restless stream on either bank,"
23962,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all unlovely when the sedges rank
23963,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Lend their coarse veil the sable ooze to hide
23964,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That bares its blackness with the ebbing tide.
23965,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In other shapes to my illumined eyes
23966,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those ragged margins of our stream arise
23967,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Through walls of stone the sparkling waters flow,"
23968,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"In clearer depths the golden sunsets glow,"
23969,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"On purer waves the lamps of midnight gleam,"

23973,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Our smiling Mother sees her broad domain
23974,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Spread its tall roofs along the western plain;
23975,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those blazoned windows' blushing glories tell
23976,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of grateful hearts that loved her long and well;
23977,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yon gilded dome that glitters in the sun
23978,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Was Dives' gift,--alas, his only one!"
23979,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These buttressed walls enshrine a banker's name,"

23983,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
23984,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Great lord of millions,--let me call thee great,"
23985,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Since countless servants at thy bidding wait,--"

24081,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24082,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Let not the mitre England's prelate wears
24083,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares,"

24085,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Leave its red mark on Younger England's brow.
24086,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We love, we honor, the maternal dame,"
24087,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But let her priesthood wear a modest name,"
24088,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While through the waters of the Pilgrim's bay
24089,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A new-born Mayflower shows her keels the way.
24090,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Too old grew Britain for her mother's beads,--"
24091,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Must we be necklaced with her children's creeds?
24092,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Welcome alike in surplice or in gown
24093,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The loyal lieges of the Heavenly Crown!
24094,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We greet with cheerful, not submissive, mien"
24095,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A sister church, but not a mitred Queen!"

24100,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Here where at first her half-fledged pinions spread.
24101,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Well I remember in the long ago
24102,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"How in the forest shades of Fontainebleau,"
24103,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Strained through a fissure in a rocky cell,"
24104,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,One crystal drop with measured cadence fell.
24105,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Still, as of old, forever bright and clear,"

24109,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24110,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of old I wandered by the river's side
24111,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Between whose banks the mighty waters glide,"
24112,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where vast Niagara, hurrying to its fall,"
24113,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Builds and unbuilds its ever-tumbling wall;
24114,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Oft in my dreams I hear the rush and roar
24115,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Of battling floods, and feel the trembling shore,"
24116,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As the huge torrent, girded for its leap,"
24117,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,With bellowing thunders plunges down the steep.
24118,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Not less distinct, from memory's pictured urn,"
24119,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The gray old rock, the leafy woods, return;"

24122,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Through the low murmur of the leaves that stir,"
24123,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The tinkling teardrop of _la roche qui pleure_.
24124,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24125,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"So when the third ripe century stands complete,"
24126,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As once again the sons of Harvard meet,"
24127,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Rejoicing, numerous as the seashore sands,"
24128,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Drawn from all quarters,--farthest distant lands,"
24129,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where through the reeds the scaly saurian steals,"
24130,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where cold Alaska feeds her floundering seals,"
24131,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where Plymouth, glorying, wears her iron crown,"
24132,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where Sacramento sees the suns go down;
24133,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nay, from the cloisters whence the refluent tide"
24134,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Wafts their pale students to our Mother's side,--"
24135,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Mid all the tumult that the day shall bring,"
24136,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While all the echoes shout, and roar, and ring,"
24137,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These tinkling lines, oblivion's easy prey,"
24138,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Once more emerging to the light of day,"
24139,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all unpleasing to the listening ear
24140,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Shall wake the memories of this bygone year,"
24141,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Heard as I hear the measured drops that flow
24142,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From the gray rock of wooded Fontainebleau.
24143,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24144,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Yet, ere I leave, one loving word for all"

24149,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"With all the future throbbing in its brain,"
24150,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And mightiest instincts which the beating heart
24151,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Fills with the fire its burning waves impart.
24152,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24153,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"O joyous youth, whose glory is to dare,--"
24154,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thy foot firm planted on the lowest stair,"
24155,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thine eye uplifted to the loftiest height
24156,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where Fame stands beckoning in the rosy light,"
24157,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thanks for thy flattering tales, thy fond deceits,"
24158,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thy loving lies, thy cheerful smiling cheats"
24159,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nature's rash promise every day is broke,--"
24160,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A thousand acorns breed a single oak,"
24161,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The myriad blooms that make the orchard gay
24162,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In barren beauty throw their lives away;
24163,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yet shall we quarrel with the sap that yields
24164,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The painted blossoms which adorn the fields,"
24165,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When the fair orchard wears its May-day suit
24166,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Of pink-white petals, for its scanty fruit?"
24167,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thrice happy hours, in hope's illusion dressed,"
24168,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"In fancy's cradle nurtured and caressed,"
24169,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Though rich the spoils that ripening years may bring,"

24171,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all the dye-stuffs from the vats of truth
24172,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Can match the rainbow on the robes of youth!
24173,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,

24175,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We leave you, fearless, when we lie in dust:"
24176,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While o'er these walls the Christian banner waves
24177,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves;
24178,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While o'er those portals Veritas you read
24179,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,No church shall bind you with its human creed.
24180,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Take from the past the best its toil has won,"
24181,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,But learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun.
24182,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed,"
24183,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Quit the old paths that error loved to tread,"
24184,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And a new wreath of living blossoms seek,"
24185,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A narrower pathway up a loftier peak;
24186,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Lose not your reverence, but unmanly fear"
24187,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Leave far behind you, all who enter here!"
24188,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
24189,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,As once of old from Ida's lofty height
24190,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The flaming signal flashed across the night,"
24191,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So Harvard's beacon sheds its unspent rays
24192,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Till every watch-tower shows its kindling blaze.
24193,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Caught from a spark and fanned by every gale,"
24194,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A brighter radiance gilds the roofs of Yale;
24195,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Amherst and Williams bid their flambeaus shine,"
24196,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And Bowdoin answers through her groves of pine;
24197,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"O'er Princeton's sands the far reflections steal,"
24198,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where mighty Edwards stamped his iron heel;
24199,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nay, on the hill where old beliefs were bound"
24200,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Fast as if Styx had girt them nine times round,"
24201,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Bursts such a light that trembling souls inquire
24202,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,If the whole church of Calvin is on fire!
24203,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Well may they ask, for what so brightly burns"
24204,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,As a dry creed that nothing ever learns?
24205,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thus link by link is knit the flaming chain

24366,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"I see thee, yet I know thee not;"
24367,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,And canst thou call thyself the same?
24368,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,
24369,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"A black, round spot,--and that is all;"
24370,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,And such a speck our earth would be
24371,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,If he who looks upon the stars
24372,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Through the red atmosphere of Mars
24373,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Could see our little creeping ball
24374,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Across the disk of crimson crawl
24375,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,As I our sister planet see.
24376,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,
24377,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"And art thou, then, a world like ours,"
24378,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Flung from the orb that whirled our own
24379,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,A molten pebble from its zone?
24380,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,How must thy burning sands absorb
24381,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"The fire-waves of the blazing orb,"
24382,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"Thy chain so short, thy path so near,"
24383,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Thy flame-defying creatures hear
24384,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,The maelstroms of the photosphere!
24385,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,And is thy bosom decked with flowers
24386,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,That steal their bloom from scalding showers?
24387,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"And bast thou cities, domes, and towers,"
24388,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"And life, and love that makes it dear,"
24389,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,And death that fills thy tribes with fear?

24391,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"Lost in my dream, my spirit soars"
24392,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Through paths the wandering angels know;

24394,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,The azure ocean's lucent shores;
24395,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"I leave my mortal self below,"
24396,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"As up the star-lit stairs I climb,"
24397,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,And still the widening view reveals
24398,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,In endless rounds the circling wheels
24399,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,That build the horologe of time.
24400,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"New spheres, new suns, new systems gleam;"
24401,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,The voice no earth-born echo hears
24402,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Steals softly on my ravished ears
24403,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"I hear them ""singing as they shine""--"
24404,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,A mortal's voice dissolves my dream:
24405,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"My patient neighbor, next in line,"
24406,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,Hints gently there are those who wait.
24407,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"O guardian of the starry gate,"
24408,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,What coin shall pay this debt of mine?
24409,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"Too slight thy claim, too small the fee"
24410,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,That bids thee turn the potent key.
24411,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,
24412,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,The Tuscan's hand has placed in thine.
24413,DURING THE TRANSIT OF VENUS,"Forgive my own the small affront,"

24700,I.,"Ere yet his summer's noon was past,"
24701,I.,"Our friend, our guide, our trusted chief,--"
24702,I.,What words can match a woe so vast!
24703,I.,
24704,I.,And whose the chartered claim to speak
24705,I.,"The sacred grief where all have part,"
24706,I.,Where sorrow saddens every cheek
24707,I.,And broods in every aching heart?
24708,I.,
24709,I.,Yet Nature prompts the burning phrase
24710,I.,"That thrills the hushed and shrouded hall,"
24711,I.,"The loud lament, the sorrowing praise,"
24712,I.,The silent tear that love lets fall.
24713,I.,
24714,I.,"In loftiest verse, in lowliest rhyme,"
24715,I.,"Shall strive unblamed the minstrel choir,---"
24716,I.,"The singers of the new-born time,"
24717,I.,And trembling age with outworn lyre.
24718,I.,
24719,I.,"No room for pride, no place for blame,--"
24720,I.,"We fling our blossoms on the grave,"
24721,I.,"Pale,--scentless,--faded,--all we claim,"

24724,I.,"Ah, could the grief of all who mourn"
24725,I.,"Blend in one voice its bitter cry,"
24726,I.,The wail to heaven's high arches borne
24727,I.,Would echo through the caverned sky.

24749,II.,As if from heaven's ethereal bow
24750,II.,Had leaped the lightning's arrowy gleam.
24751,II.,
24752,II.,Blot the foul deed from history's page;
24753,II.,Let not the all-betraying sun

24764,III.,
24765,III.,The strife endures how long! how long!

24774,III.,
24775,III.,"Slowly the stores of life are spent,"
24776,III.,Yet hope still battles with despair;
24777,III.,Will Heaven not yield when knees are bent?
24778,III.,"Answer, O thou that hearest prayer."
24779,III.,
24780,III.,But silent is the brazen sky;
24781,III.,"On sweeps the meteor's threatening train,"
24782,III.,"Unswerving Nature's mute reply,"
24783,III.,Bound in her adamantine chain.
24784,III.,
24785,III.,Not ours the verdict to decide
24786,III.,Whom death shall claim or skill shall save;
24787,III.,"The hero's life though Heaven denied,"
24788,III.,It gave our land a martyr's grave.
24789,III.,
24790,III.,Nor count the teaching vainly sent
24791,III.,"How human hearts their griefs may share,--"
24792,III.,"The lesson woman's love has lent,"
24793,III.,"What hope may do, what faith can bear!"
24794,III.,
24795,III.,Farewell! the leaf-strown earth enfolds
24796,III.,"Our stay, our pride, our hopes, our fears,"

25691,TO MY OLD READERS,"Nor HE, the owner of the squinting brain,"
25692,TO MY OLD READERS,"Which, while its curious fancies we pursue,"
25693,TO MY OLD READERS,"Oft makes us question, ""Are we crack-brained too?"""
25694,TO MY OLD READERS,
25695,TO MY OLD READERS,"Along the board our growing list extends,"
25696,TO MY OLD READERS,"As one by one we count our clustering friends,--"
25697,TO MY OLD READERS,The youthful DOCTOR waiting for his share
25698,TO MY OLD READERS,Of fits and fevers when his crown gets bare;
25699,TO MY OLD READERS,"In strong, dark lines our square-nibbed pen should draw"
25700,TO MY OLD READERS,The lordly presence of the MAN OF LAW;
25701,TO MY OLD READERS,"Our bashful TUTOR claims a humbler place,"
25702,TO MY OLD READERS,"A lighter touch, his slender form to trace."
25703,TO MY OLD READERS,"Mark the fair lady he is seated by,--"
25704,TO MY OLD READERS,"Some say he is her lover,--some deny,--"
25705,TO MY OLD READERS,"Watch them together,--time alone can show"
25706,TO MY OLD READERS,If dead-ripe friendship turns to love or no.
25707,TO MY OLD READERS,Where in my list of phrases shall I seek
25708,TO MY OLD READERS,The fitting words of NUMBER FIVE to speak?
25709,TO MY OLD READERS,"Such task demands a readier pen than mine,--"
25710,TO MY OLD READERS,What if I steal the Tutor's Valentine?
25711,TO MY OLD READERS,
25712,TO MY OLD READERS,"Why should I call her gracious, winning, fair?"
25713,TO MY OLD READERS,Why with the loveliest of her sex compare?
25714,TO MY OLD READERS,"Those varied charms have many a Muse inspired,--"
25715,TO MY OLD READERS,At last their worn superlatives have tired;
25716,TO MY OLD READERS,"Wit, beauty, sweetness, each alluring grace,"
25717,TO MY OLD READERS,All these in honeyed verse have found their place;
25718,TO MY OLD READERS,"I need them not,--two little words I find"
25719,TO MY OLD READERS,Which hold them all in happiest form combined;
25720,TO MY OLD READERS,"No more with baffled language will I strive,--"
25721,TO MY OLD READERS,All in one breath I utter: Number Five!
25722,TO MY OLD READERS,
25723,TO MY OLD READERS,Now count our teaspoons--if you care to learn
25724,TO MY OLD READERS,"How many tinkling cups were served in turn,--"
25725,TO MY OLD READERS,"Add all together, you will find them ten,--"
25726,TO MY OLD READERS,Our young MUSICIAN joined us now and then.
25727,TO MY OLD READERS,"Our bright DELILAH you must needs recall,"
25728,TO MY OLD READERS,"The comely handmaid, youngest of us all;"
25729,TO MY OLD READERS,Need I remind you how the little maid
25730,TO MY OLD READERS,"Came at a pinch to our Professor's aid,--"
25731,TO MY OLD READERS,Trimmed his long locks with unrelenting shears
25732,TO MY OLD READERS,And eased his looks of half a score of years?
25733,TO MY OLD READERS,
25734,TO MY OLD READERS,"Sometimes, at table, as you well must know,"
25735,TO MY OLD READERS,"The stream of talk will all at once run low,"
25736,TO MY OLD READERS,"The air seems smitten with a sudden chill,"
25737,TO MY OLD READERS,The wit grows silent and the gossip still;
25738,TO MY OLD READERS,"This was our poet's chance, the hour of need,"
25739,TO MY OLD READERS,When rhymes and stories we were used to read.
25740,TO MY OLD READERS,"One day a whisper round the teacups stole,--"
25741,TO MY OLD READERS,"""No scrap of paper in the silver bowl!"""
25742,TO MY OLD READERS,"(Our ""poet's corner"" may I not expect"
25743,TO MY OLD READERS,My kindly reader still may recollect?)
25744,TO MY OLD READERS,"""What! not a line to keep our souls alive?"""
25745,TO MY OLD READERS,Spoke in her silvery accents Number Five.
25746,TO MY OLD READERS,"""No matter, something we must find to read,--"
25747,TO MY OLD READERS,"Find it or make it,--yes, we must indeed!"
25748,TO MY OLD READERS,Now I remember I have seen at times
25749,TO MY OLD READERS,"Some curious stories in a book of rhymes,--"
25750,TO MY OLD READERS,"How certain secrets, long in silence sealed,"
25751,TO MY OLD READERS,In after days were guessed at or revealed.
25752,TO MY OLD READERS,"Those stories, doubtless, some of you must know,--"
25753,TO MY OLD READERS,They all were written many a year ago;
25754,TO MY OLD READERS,"But an old story, be it false or true,"
25755,TO MY OLD READERS,"Twice told, well told, is twice as good as new;"
25756,TO MY OLD READERS,"Wait but three sips and I will go myself,"
25757,TO MY OLD READERS,"And fetch the book of verses from its shelf."""
25758,TO MY OLD READERS,"No time was lost in finding what she sought,--"
25759,TO MY OLD READERS,"Gone but one moment,--lo! the book is brought."
25760,TO MY OLD READERS,
25761,TO MY OLD READERS,"""Now, then, Professor, fortune has decreed"
25762,TO MY OLD READERS,"That you, this evening, shall be first to read,--"
25763,TO MY OLD READERS,"Lucky for us that listen, for in fact"
25764,TO MY OLD READERS,"Who reads this poem must know how to _act_."""
25765,TO MY OLD READERS,Right well she knew that in his greener age
25766,TO MY OLD READERS,He had a mighty hankering for the stage.
25767,TO MY OLD READERS,The patient audience had not long to wait;
25768,TO MY OLD READERS,"Pleased with his chance, he smiled and took the bait;"
25769,TO MY OLD READERS,"Through his wild hair his coaxing fingers ran,--"
25770,TO MY OLD READERS,He spread the page before him and began.

25775,THE BANKER'S SECRET,THE BANKER'S SECRET
25776,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25777,THE BANKER'S SECRET,THE Banker's dinner is the stateliest feast
25778,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The town has heard of for a year, at least;"
25779,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sparry lustres shed their broadest blaze,"
25780,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Damask and silver catch and spread the rays;
25781,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The florist's triumphs crown the daintier spoil
25782,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Won from the sea, the forest, or the soil;"
25783,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The steaming hot-house yields its largest pines,"
25784,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The sunless vaults unearth their oldest wines;
25785,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"With one admiring look the scene survey,"
25786,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And turn a moment from the bright display.
25787,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25788,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Of all the joys of earthly pride or power,"
25789,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"What gives most life, worth living, in an hour?"
25790,THE BANKER'S SECRET,When Victory settles on the doubtful fight
25791,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And the last foeman wheels in panting flight,"
25792,THE BANKER'S SECRET,No thrill like this is felt beneath the sun;
25793,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Life's sovereign moment is a battle won.
25794,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But say what next? To shape a Senate's choice,"
25795,THE BANKER'S SECRET,By the strong magic of the master's voice;
25796,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To ride the stormy tempest of debate
25797,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That whirls the wavering fortunes of the state.
25798,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Third in the list, the happy lover's prize"
25799,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is won by honeyed words from women's eyes.
25800,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"If some would have it first instead of third,"
25801,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So let it be,--I answer not a word."
25802,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The fourth,--sweet readers, let the thoughtless half"
25803,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Have its small shrug and inoffensive laugh;
25804,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Let the grave quarter wear its virtuous frown,"
25805,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The stern half-quarter try to scowl us down;
25806,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But the last eighth, the choice and sifted few,"
25807,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Will hear my words, and, pleased, confess them true."
25808,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25809,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Among the great whom Heaven has made to shine,"
25810,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"How few have learned the art of arts,--to dine!"
25811,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Nature, indulgent to our daily need,"
25812,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Kind-hearted mother! taught us all to feed;
25813,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But the chief art,--how rarely Nature flings"
25814,THE BANKER'S SECRET,This choicest gift among her social kings
25815,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Say, man of truth, has life a brighter hour"
25816,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Than waits the chosen guest who knows his power?
25817,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He moves with ease, itself an angel charm,--"
25818,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Lifts with light touch my lady's jewelled arm,"
25819,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Slides to his seat, half leading and half led,"
25820,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Smiling but quiet till the grace is said,"
25821,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Then gently kindles, while by slow degrees"
25822,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Creep softly out the little arts that please;
25823,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bright looks, the cheerful language of the eye,"
25824,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The neat, crisp question and the gay reply,--"
25825,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Talk light and airy, such as well may pass"
25826,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Between the rested fork and lifted glass;--
25827,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"With play like this the earlier evening flies,"
25828,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Till rustling silks proclaim the ladies rise.
25829,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His hour has come,--he looks along the chairs,"
25830,THE BANKER'S SECRET,As the Great Duke surveyed his iron squares.
25831,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That's the young traveller,--is n't much to show,--"
25832,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Fast on the road, but at the table slow."
25833,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Next him,--you see the author in his look,--"
25834,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His forehead lined with wrinkles like a book,--"
25835,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Wrote the great history of the ancient Huns,--"
25836,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Holds back to fire among the heavy guns.
25837,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Oh, there's our poet seated at his side,"
25838,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Beloved of ladies, soft, cerulean-eyed."
25839,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Poets are prosy in their common talk,"
25840,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"As the fast trotters, for the most part, walk."
25841,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there's our well-dressed gentleman, who sits,"
25842,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"By right divine, no doubt, among the wits,"
25843,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Who airs his tailor's patterns when he walks,"
25844,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The man that often speaks, but never talks."
25845,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Why should he talk, whose presence lends a grace"
25846,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To every table where he shows his face?
25847,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He knows the manual of the silver fork,"
25848,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Can name his claret--if he sees the cork,--"
25849,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Remark that ""White-top"" was considered fine,"
25850,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But swear the ""Juno"" is the better wine;--"
25851,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is not this talking? Ask Quintilian's rules;
25852,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"If they say No, the town has many fools."
25853,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Pause for a moment,--for our eyes behold"
25854,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The plain unsceptred king, the man of gold,"
25855,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The thrice illustrious threefold millionnaire;
25856,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Mark his slow-creeping, dead, metallic stare;"
25857,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His eyes, dull glimmering, like the balance-pan"
25858,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That weighs its guinea as he weighs his man.
25859,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who's next? An artist in a satin tie
25860,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Whose ample folds defeat the curious eye.
25861,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there 's the cousin,--must be asked, you know,--"
25862,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Looks like a spinster at a baby-show.
25863,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hope he is cool,--they set him next the door,--"
25864,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And likes his place, between the gap and bore."
25865,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Next comes a Congressman, distinguished guest"
25866,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We don't count him,--they asked him with the rest;"
25867,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And then some white cravats, with well-shaped ties,"
25868,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And heads above them which their owners prize.
25869,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25870,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Of all that cluster round the genial board,"
25871,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Not one so radiant as the banquet's lord.
25872,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Some say they fancy, but they know not why,"
25873,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A shade of trouble brooding in his eye,"
25874,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Nothing, perhaps,--the rooms are overhot,--"
25875,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Yet see his cheek,--the dull-red burning spot,--"
25876,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Taste the brown sherry which he does not pass,--"
25877,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Ha! That is brandy; see him fill his glass!
25878,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But not forgetful of his feasting friends,"
25879,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To each in turn some lively word he sends;
25880,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"See how he throws his baited lines about,"
25881,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And plays his men as anglers play their trout.
25882,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A question drops among the listening crew
25883,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And hits the traveller, pat on Timbuctoo."
25884,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We're on the Niger, somewhere near its source,--"
25885,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Not the least hurry, take the river's course"
25886,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Through Kissi, Foota, Kankan, Bammakoo,"
25887,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bambarra, Sego, so to Timbuctoo,"
25888,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Thence down to Youri;--stop him if we can,"
25889,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We can't fare worse,--wake up the Congressman!"
25890,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The Congressman, once on his talking legs,"
25891,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Stirs up his knowledge to its thickest dregs;
25892,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Tremendous draught for dining men to quaff!
25893,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Nothing will choke him but a purpling laugh.
25894,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A word,--a shout,--a mighty roar,--'t is done;"
25895,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Extinguished; lassoed by a treacherous pun.
25896,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A laugh is priming to the loaded soul;
25897,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The scattering shots become a steady roll,"
25898,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Broke by sharp cracks that run along the line,"
25899,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The light artillery of the talker's wine.
25900,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The kindling goblets flame with golden dews,"
25901,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The hoarded flasks their tawny fire diffuse,"
25902,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And the Rhine's breast-milk gushes cold and bright,"
25903,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Pale as the moon and maddening as her light;
25904,THE BANKER'S SECRET,With crimson juice the thirsty southern sky
25905,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Sucks from the hills where buried armies lie,"
25906,THE BANKER'S SECRET,So that the dreamy passion it imparts
25907,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is drawn from heroes' bones and lovers' hearts.
25908,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But lulls will come; the flashing soul transmits
25909,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Its gleams of light in alternating fits.
25910,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The shower of talk that rattled down amain
25911,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Ends in small patterings like an April's rain;
25912,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25913,THE BANKER'S SECRET,With the dry sticks all bonfires are begun;
25914,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bring the first fagot, proser number one"
25915,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The voices halt; the game is at a stand;
25916,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Now for a solo from the master-hand
25917,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"'T is but a story,--quite a simple thing,--"
25918,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"An aria touched upon a single string,"
25919,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But every accent comes with such a grace
25920,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The stupid servants listen in their place,"
25921,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Each with his waiter in his lifted hands,"
25922,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Still as a well-bred pointer when he stands.
25923,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A query checks him: ""Is he quite exact?"""
25924,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"(This from a grizzled, square-jawed man of fact.)"
25925,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sparkling story leaves him to his fate,"
25926,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Crushed by a witness, smothered with a date,"
25927,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"As a swift river, sown with many a star,"
25928,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Runs brighter, rippling on a shallow bar."
25929,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The smooth divine suggests a graver doubt;
25930,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A neat quotation bowls the parson out;
25931,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Then, sliding gayly from his own display,"
25932,THE BANKER'S SECRET,He laughs the learned dulness all away.
25933,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So, with the merry tale and jovial song,"
25934,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The jocund evening whirls itself along,"
25935,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Till the last chorus shrieks its loud encore,"
25936,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And the white neckcloths vanish through the door.
25937,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25938,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"One savage word!--The menials know its tone,"
25939,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And slink away; the master stands alone.
25940,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Well played, by ---""; breathe not what were best unheard;"
25941,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His goblet shivers while he speaks the word,--"
25942,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""If wine tells truth,--and so have said the wise,--"
25943,THE BANKER'S SECRET,It makes me laugh to think how brandy lies!
25944,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bankrupt to-morrow,--millionnaire to-day,--"
25945,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The farce is over,--now begins the play!"""
25946,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The spring he touches lets a panel glide;
25947,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"An iron closet harks beneath the slide,"
25948,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bright with such treasures as a search might bring
25949,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From the deep pockets of a truant king.
25950,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Two diamonds, eyeballs of a god of bronze,"
25951,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bought from his faithful priest, a pious bonze;"
25952,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A string of brilliants; rubies, three or four;"
25953,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bags of old coin and bars of virgin ore;
25954,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A jewelled poniard and a Turkish knife,"
25955,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Noiseless and useful if we come to strife.
25956,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Gone! As a pirate flies before the wind,"
25957,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And not one tear for all he leaves behind
25958,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From all the love his better years have known
25959,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Fled like a felon,--ah! but not alone!"
25960,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The chariot flashes through a lantern's glare,--"
25961,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Oh the wild eyes! the storm of sable hair!
25962,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Still to his side the broken heart will cling,--"
25963,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The bride of shame, the wife without the ring"
25964,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hark, the deep oath,--the wail of frenzied woe,--"
25965,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Lost! lost to hope of Heaven and peace below!
25966,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25967,THE BANKER'S SECRET,He kept his secret; but the seed of crime
25968,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bursts of itself in God's appointed time.
25969,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide;
25970,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"One never blamed nor wept,--she only died."
25971,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"None knew his lot, though idle tongues would say"
25972,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He sought a lonely refuge far away,"
25973,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there, with borrowed name and altered mien,"
25974,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He died unheeded, as he lived unseen."
25975,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The moral market had the usual chills
25976,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Of Virtue suffering from protested bills;
25977,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The White Cravats, to friendship's memory true,"
25978,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Sighed for the past, surveyed the future too;"
25979,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Their sorrow breathed in one expressive line,--"
25980,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Gave pleasant dinners; who has got his wine?"""
25981,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25982,THE BANKER'S SECRET,. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

25985,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He, like the rest, was not averse to praise."
25986,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Voices and hands united; every one
25987,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Joined in approval: ""Number Three, well done!"""
25988,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
25989,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Now for the Exile's story; if my wits"
25990,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Are not at fault, his curious record fits"
25991,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Neatly as sequel to the tale we've heard;
25992,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Not wholly wild the fancy, nor absurd"
25993,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That this our island hermit well might be
25994,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That story's hero, fled from over sea."
25995,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Come, Number Seven, we would not have you strain"
25996,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The fertile powers of that inventive brain.
25997,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Read us 'The Exile's Secret'; there's enough
25998,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Of dream-like fiction and fantastic stuff

26003,THE BANKER'S SECRET,No harm was known of that secluded man.
26004,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He lived alone,--who would n't if he might,"
26005,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And leave the rogues and idiots out of sight?
26006,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A foolish story,--still, I'll do my best,--"
26007,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The house was real,--don't believe the rest."
26008,THE BANKER'S SECRET,How could a ruined dwelling last so long
26009,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Without its legends shaped in tale and song?
26010,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who was this man of whom they tell the lies?
26011,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Perhaps--why not?--NAPOLEON! in disguise,--"
26012,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So some said, kidnapped from his ocean coop,"
26013,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Brought to this island in a coasting sloop,--"
26014,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Meanwhile a sham Napoleon in his place
26015,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Played Nap. and saved Sir Hudson from disgrace.
26016,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Such was one story; others used to say,"
26017,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""No,--not Napoleon,--it was Marshal Ney."""
26018,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Shot?"" Yes, no doubt, but not with balls of lead,"
26019,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But balls of pith that never shoot folks dead.
26020,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He wandered round, lived South for many a year,"
26021,THE BANKER'S SECRET,At last came North and fixed his dwelling here.
26022,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Choose which you will of all the tales that pile
26023,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Their mingling fables on the tree-crowned isle.
26024,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who wrote this modest version I suppose
26025,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That truthful Teacup, our Dictator, knows;"
26026,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Made up of various legends, it would seem,"
26027,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sailor's yarn, the crazy poet's dream."
26028,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Such tales as this, by simple souls received,"
26029,THE BANKER'S SECRET,At first are stared at and at last believed;
26030,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From threads like this the grave historians try
26031,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"To weave their webs, and never know they lie."
26032,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hear, then, the fables that have gathered round"
26033,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The lonely home an exiled stranger found.
26034,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
26035,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
26036,THE EXILE'S SECRET,THE EXILE'S SECRET
26037,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26038,THE EXILE'S SECRET,YE that have faced the billows and the spray
26039,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Of good St. Botolph's island-studded bay,"
26040,THE EXILE'S SECRET,As from the gliding bark your eye has scanned
26041,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The beaconed rocks, the wave-girt hills of sand,"
26042,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Have ye not marked one elm-o'ershadowed isle,"
26043,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Round as the dimple chased in beauty's smile,--"
26044,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"A stain of verdure on an azure field,"
26045,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Set like a jewel in a battered shield?
26046,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Fixed in the narrow gorge of Ocean's path,"
26047,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Peaceful it meets him in his hour of wrath;
26048,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"When the mailed Titan, scourged by hissing gales,"
26049,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Writhes in his glistening coat of clashing scales,"
26050,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The storm-beat island spreads its tranquil green,"
26051,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Calm as an emerald on an angry queen.
26052,THE EXILE'S SECRET,So fair when distant should be fairer near;
26053,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A boat shall waft us from the outstretched pier.
26054,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The breeze blows fresh; we reach the island's edge,"
26055,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Our shallop rustling through the yielding sedge.
26056,THE EXILE'S SECRET,No welcome greets us on the desert isle;
26057,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Those elms, far-shadowing, hide no stately pile"
26058,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Yet these green ridges mark an ancient road;
26059,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And to! the traces of a fair abode;
26060,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The long gray line that marks a garden-wall,"
26061,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And heaps of fallen beams,--fire-branded all."
26062,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26063,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Who sees unmoved, a ruin at his feet,"
26064,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The lowliest home where human hearts have beat?
26065,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its hearthstone, shaded with the bistre stain"
26066,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A century's showery torrents wash in vain;
26067,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its starving orchard, where the thistle blows"
26068,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And mossy trunks still mark the broken rows;
26069,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its chimney-loving poplar, oftenest seen"
26070,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Next an old roof, or where a roof has been;"
26071,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its knot-grass, plantain,--all the social weeds,"
26072,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Man's mute companions, following where he leads;"
26073,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its dwarfed, pale flowers, that show their straggling heads,"
26074,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Sown by the wind from grass-choked garden-beds;
26075,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its woodbine, creeping where it used to climb;"
26076,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its roses, breathing of the olden time;"
26077,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"All the poor shows the curious idler sees,"
26078,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"As life's thin shadows waste by slow degrees,"
26079,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Till naught remains, the saddening tale to tell,"
26080,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Save home's last wrecks,--the cellar and the well?"
26081,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26082,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And whose the home that strews in black decay
26083,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The one green-glowing island of the bay?
26084,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some dark-browed pirate's, jealous of the fate"
26085,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"That seized the strangled wretch of ""Nix's Mate""?"
26086,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some forger's, skulking in a borrowed name,"
26087,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Whom Tyburn's dangling halter yet may claim?
26088,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some wan-eyed exile's, wealth and sorrow's heir,"
26089,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Who sought a lone retreat for tears and prayer?
26090,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some brooding poet's, sure of deathless fame,"
26091,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Had not his epic perished in the flame?
26092,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or some gray wooer's, whom a girlish frown"
26093,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Chased from his solid friends and sober town?
26094,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or some plain tradesman's, fond of shade and ease,"
26095,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Who sought them both beneath these quiet trees?
26096,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Why question mutes no question can unlock,"
26097,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Dumb as the legend on the Dighton rock?
26098,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"One thing at least these ruined heaps declare,--"
26099,THE EXILE'S SECRET,They were a shelter once; a man lived there.
26100,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26101,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But where the charred and crumbling records fail,"
26102,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some breathing lips may piece the half-told tale;
26103,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"No man may live with neighbors such as these,"
26104,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Though girt with walls of rock and angry seas,"
26105,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And shield his home, his children, or his wife,"
26106,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His ways, his means, his vote, his creed, his life,"
26107,THE EXILE'S SECRET,From the dread sovereignty of Ears and Eyes
26108,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And the small member that beneath them lies.
26109,THE EXILE'S SECRET,They told strange things of that mysterious man;
26110,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Believe who will, deny them such as can;"
26111,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Why should we fret if every passing sail
26112,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Had its old seaman talking on the rail?
26113,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The deep-sunk schooner stuffed with Eastern lime,"
26114,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Slow wedging on, as if the waves were slime;"
26115,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The knife-edged clipper with her ruffled spars,"
26116,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The pawing steamer with her inane of stars,"
26117,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The bull-browed galliot butting through the stream,"
26118,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The wide-sailed yacht that slipped along her beam,"
26119,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The deck-piled sloops, the pinched chebacco-boats,"
26120,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The frigate, black with thunder-freighted throats,"
26121,THE EXILE'S SECRET,All had their talk about the lonely man;
26122,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And thus, in varying phrase, the story ran."
26123,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His name had cost him little care to seek,"
26124,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Plain, honest, brief, a decent name to speak,"
26125,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Common, not vulgar, just the kind that slips"
26126,THE EXILE'S SECRET,With least suggestion from a stranger's lips.
26127,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His birthplace England, as his speech might show,"
26128,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or his hale cheek, that wore the red-streak's glow;"
26129,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His mouth sharp-moulded; in its mirth or scorn
26130,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"There came a flash as from the milky corn,"
26131,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"When from the ear you rip the rustling sheath,"
26132,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And the white ridges show their even teeth.
26133,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His stature moderate, but his strength confessed,"
26134,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"In spite of broadcloth, by his ample breast;"
26135,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Full-armed, thick-handed; one that had been strong,"
26136,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And might be dangerous still, if things went wrong."
26137,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He lived at ease beneath his elm-trees' shade,"
26138,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Did naught for gain, yet all his debts were paid;"
26139,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Rich, so 't was thought, but careful of his store;"
26140,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Had all he needed, claimed to have no more."
26141,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26142,THE EXILE'S SECRET,But some that lingered round the isle at night
26143,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Spoke of strange stealthy doings in their sight;
26144,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of creeping lonely visits that he made
26145,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"To nooks and corners, with a torch and spade."
26146,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some said they saw the hollow of a cave;
26147,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"One, given to fables, swore it was a grave;"
26148,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Whereat some shuddered, others boldly cried,"
26149,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Those prowling boatmen lied, and knew they lied."
26150,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"They said his house was framed with curious cares,"
26151,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Lest some old friend might enter unawares;
26152,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That on the platform at his chamber's door
26153,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Hinged a loose square that opened through the floor;
26154,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Touch the black silken tassel next the bell,"
26155,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Down, with a crash, the flapping trap-door fell;"
26156,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Three stories deep the falling wretch would strike,"
26157,THE EXILE'S SECRET,To writhe at leisure on a boarder's pike.
26158,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"By day armed always; double-armed at night,"
26159,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26160,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His tools lay round him; wake him such as might.
26161,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"A carbine hung beside his India fan,"
26162,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His hand could reach a Turkish ataghan;
26163,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Pistols, with quaint-carved stocks and barrels gilt,"
26164,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Crossed a long dagger with a jewelled hilt;
26165,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A slashing cutlass stretched along the bed;--
26166,THE EXILE'S SECRET,All this was what those lying boatmen said.
26167,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Then some were full of wondrous stories told
26168,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of great oak chests and cupboards full of gold;
26169,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of the wedged ingots and the silver bars
26170,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That cost old pirates ugly sabre-scars;
26171,THE EXILE'S SECRET,How his laced wallet often would disgorge
26172,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The fresh-faced guinea of an English George,"
26173,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or sweated ducat, palmed by Jews of yore,"
26174,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or double Joe, or Portuguese moidore;"
26175,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And how his finger wore a rubied ring
26176,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Fit for the white-necked play-girl of a king.
26177,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But these fine legends, told with staring eyes,"
26178,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Met with small credence from the old and wise.
26179,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26180,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Why tell each idle guess, each whisper vain?"
26181,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Enough: the scorched and cindered beams remain.
26182,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He came, a silent pilgrim to the West,"
26183,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some old-world mystery throbbing in his breast;
26184,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Close to the thronging mart he dwelt alone;
26185,THE EXILE'S SECRET,He lived; he died. The rest is all unknown.
26186,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26187,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Stranger, whose eyes the shadowy isle survey,"
26188,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"As the black steamer dashes through the bay,"
26189,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Why ask his buried secret to divine?
26190,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He was thy brother; speak, and tell us thine!"
26191,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26192,THE EXILE'S SECRET,. . . . . . . . . . .
26193,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26194,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Silence at first, a kind of spell-bound pause;"
26195,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Then all the Teacups tinkled their applause;
26196,THE EXILE'S SECRET,When that was hushed no sound the stillness broke
26197,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Till once again the soft-voiced lady spoke:
26198,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26199,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""The Lover's Secret,--surely that must need"
26200,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The youngest voice our table holds to read.
26201,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Which of our two 'Annexes' shall we choose?
26202,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Either were charming, neither will refuse;"
26203,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But choose we must,--what better can we do"
26204,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Than take the younger of the youthful two?"""
26205,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26206,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"True to the primal instinct of her sex,"
26207,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""Why, that means me,"" half whispered each Annex."
26208,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""What if it does?"" the voiceless question came,"
26209,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That set those pale New England cheeks aflame;
26210,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""Our old-world scholar may have ways to teach"
26211,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Of Oxford English, Britain's purest speech,--"
26212,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"She shall be youngest,--youngest for _to-day_,--"
26213,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Our dates we'll fix hereafter as we may;
26214,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"_All rights reserved_,--the words we know so well,"
26215,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"That guard the claims of books which never sell."""
26216,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The British maiden bowed a pleased assent,"
26217,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Her two long ringlets swinging as she bent;
26218,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The glistening eyes her eager soul looked through
26219,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Betrayed her lineage in their Saxon blue.
26220,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Backward she flung each too obtrusive curl
26221,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And thus began,--the rose-lipped English girl."
26222,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26223,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
26224,THE LOVER'S SECRET,THE LOVER'S SECRET
26225,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
26226,THE LOVER'S SECRET,WHAT ailed young Lucius? Art had vainly tried
26227,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"To guess his ill, and found herself defied."
26228,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The Augur plied his legendary skill;
26229,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Useless; the fair young Roman languished still.
26230,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His chariot took him every cloudless day
26231,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Along the Pincian Hill or Appian Way;
26232,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They rubbed his wasted limbs with sulphurous oil,"
26233,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Oozed from the far-off Orient's heated soil;
26234,THE LOVER'S SECRET,They led him tottering down the steamy path
26235,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Where bubbling fountains filled the thermal bath;
26236,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Borne in his litter to Egeria's cave,"
26237,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They washed him, shivering, in her icy wave."
26238,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They sought all curious herbs and costly stones,"
26239,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They scraped the moss that grew on dead men's bones,"
26240,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They tried all cures the votive tablets taught,"
26241,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Scoured every place whence healing drugs were brought,"
26242,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"O'er Thracian hills his breathless couriers ran,"
26243,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His slaves waylaid the Syrian caravan.
26244,THE LOVER'S SECRET,At last a servant heard a stranger speak
26245,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A new chirurgeon's name; a clever Greek,"
26246,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Skilled in his art; from Pergamus he came
26247,THE LOVER'S SECRET,To Rome but lately; GALEN was the name.
26248,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The Greek was called: a man with piercing eyes,"
26249,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Who must be cunning, and who might be wise."
26250,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"He spoke but little,--if they pleased, he said,"
26251,THE LOVER'S SECRET,He 'd wait awhile beside the sufferer's bed.
26252,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"So by his side he sat, serene and calm,"
26253,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His very accents soft as healing balm;
26254,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Not curious seemed, but every movement spied,"
26255,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His sharp eyes searching where they seemed to glide;
26256,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Asked a few questions,--what he felt, and where?"
26257,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""A pain just here,"" ""A constant beating there."""
26258,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Who ordered bathing for his aches and ails?
26259,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""Charmis, the water-doctor from Marseilles."""
26260,THE LOVER'S SECRET,What was the last prescription in his case?
26261,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""A draught of wine with powdered chrysoprase."""
26262,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Had he no secret grief he nursed alone?
26263,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A pause; a little tremor; answer,--""None."""
26264,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Thoughtful, a moment, sat the cunning leech,"
26265,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"And muttered ""Eros!"" in his native speech."
26266,THE LOVER'S SECRET,In the broad atrium various friends await
26267,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The last new utterance from the lips of fate;
26268,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Men, matrons, maids, they talk the question o'er,"
26269,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"And, restless, pace the tessellated floor."
26270,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Not unobserved the youth so long had pined
26271,THE LOVER'S SECRET,By gentle-hearted dames and damsels kind;
26272,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"One with the rest, a rich Patrician's pride,"
26273,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The lady Hermia, called ""the golden-eyed"";"
26274,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The same the old Proconsul fain must woo,"
26275,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Whom, one dark night, a masked sicarius slew;"
26276,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The same black Crassus over roughly pressed
26277,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"To hear his suit,--the Tiber knows the rest."
26278,THE LOVER'S SECRET,(Crassus was missed next morning by his set;
26279,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Next week the fishers found him in their net.)
26280,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"She with the others paced the ample hall,"
26281,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Fairest, alas! and saddest of them all."
26282,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
26283,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"At length the Greek declared, with puzzled face,"
26284,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Some strange enchantment mingled in the case,"
26285,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And naught would serve to act as counter-charm
26286,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Save a warm bracelet from a maiden's arm.
26287,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Not every maiden's,--many might be tried;"
26288,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Which not in vain, experience must decide."
26289,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Were there no damsels willing to attend
26290,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And do such service for a suffering friend?
26291,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The message passed among the waiting crowd,"
26292,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"First in a whisper, then proclaimed aloud."
26293,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Some wore no jewels; some were disinclined,"
26294,THE LOVER'S SECRET,For reasons better guessed at than defined;
26295,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Though all were saints,--at least professed to be,--"
26296,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The list all counted, there were named but three."
26297,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The leech, still seated by the patient's side,"
26298,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Held his thin wrist, and watched him, eagle-eyed."
26299,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Aurelia first, a fair-haired Tuscan girl,"
26300,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Slipped off her golden asp, with eyes of pearl."
26301,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His solemn head the grave physician shook;
26302,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The waxen features thanked her with a look.
26303,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Olympia next, a creature half divine,"
26304,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Sprung from the blood of old Evander's line,"
26305,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Held her white arm, that wore a twisted chain"
26306,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Clasped with an opal-sheeny cymophane.
26307,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"In vain, O daughter I said the baffled Greek."
26308,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The patient sighed the thanks he could not speak.
26309,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
26310,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Last, Hermia entered; look, that sudden start!"
26311,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The pallium heaves above his leaping heart;
26312,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The beating pulse, the cheek's rekindled flame,"
26313,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Those quivering lips, the secret all proclaim."
26314,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The deep disease long throbbing in the breast,"
26315,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The dread enchantment, all at once confessed!"
26316,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The case was plain; the treatment was begun;
26317,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And Love soon cured the mischief he had done.
26318,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
26319,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Young Love, too oft thy treacherous bandage slips"

26351,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A statesman's forehead, athlete's throat and jaw,"
26352,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Such the proud semblance of the Man of Law.
26353,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"His eye just lighted on the printed leaf,"

26462,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Ave, Maria! Pardon, if I wrong"
26463,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Those heavenly words that shame my earthly song!

26466,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And now the shepherds, hastening on their way,"
26467,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Sought the still hamlet where the Infant lay.
26468,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They passed the fields that gleaning Ruth toiled o'er,--"
26469,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,They saw afar the ruined threshing-floor
26470,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Where Moab's daughter, homeless and forlorn,"
26471,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Found Boaz slumbering by his heaps of corn;
26472,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And some remembered how the holy scribe,"
26473,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Skilled in the lore of every jealous tribe,"
26474,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Traced the warm blood of Jesse's royal son
26475,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"To that fair alien, bravely wooed and won."
26476,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"So fared they on to seek the promised sign,"
26477,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,That marked the anointed heir of David's line.

26479,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They found the crowded inn, the oxen's shed."
26480,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,
26481,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"No pomp was there, no glory shone around"
26482,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,On the coarse straw that strewed the reeking ground;
26483,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"One dim retreat a flickering torch betrayed,--"
26484,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,In that poor cell the Lord of Life was laid
26485,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The wondering shepherds told their breathless tale
26486,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Of the bright choir that woke the sleeping vale;
26487,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Told how the skies with sudden glory flamed,"

26495,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"No trembling word the mother's joy revealed,--"
26496,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"One sigh of rapture, and her lips were sealed;"
26497,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Unmoved she saw the rustic train depart,"
26498,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,But kept their words to ponder in her heart.
26499,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,
26500,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Twelve years had passed; the boy was fair and tall,"
26501,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Growing in wisdom, finding grace with all."

26503,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their balanced urns beside the mountain rill,"
26504,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The gathered matrons, as they sat and spun,"
26505,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Spoke in soft words of Joseph's quiet son.
26506,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,No voice had reached the Galilean vale
26507,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Of star-led kings, or awe-struck shepherd's tale;"
26508,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"In the meek, studious child they only saw"
26509,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The future Rabbi, learned in Israel's law."

26513,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Snatched from the steel of Herod's murdering bands,"
26514,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"A babe, close folded to his mother's breast,"
26515,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Through Edom's wilds he sought the sheltering West.
26516,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Then Joseph spake: ""Thy boy hath largely grown;"

26526,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They reach the Holy Place, fulfil the days"
26527,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"To solemn feasting given, and grateful praise."
26528,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"At last they turn, and far Moriah's height"
26529,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Melts in the southern sky and fades from sight.
26530,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,All day the dusky caravan has flowed

26538,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The soldier's lance, the fierce centurion's sword,"
26539,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The crushing wheels that whirl some Roman lord,"
26540,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The midnight crypt that sucks the captive's breath,"

26543,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Thrice on his lips the mildewed kiss of night,"
26544,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Crouched by a sheltering column's shining plinth,"
26545,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Or stretched beneath the odorous terebinth.
26546,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"At last, in desperate mood, they sought once more"
26547,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The Temple's porches, searched in vain before;"
26548,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They found him seated with the ancient men,--"
26549,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The grim old rufflers of the tongue and pen,--"
26550,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their bald heads glistening as they clustered near,"
26551,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their gray beards slanting as they turned to hear,"
26552,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Lost in half-envious wonder and surprise
26553,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,That lips so fresh should utter words so wise.
26554,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And Mary said,--as one who, tried too long,"
26555,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Tells all her grief and half her sense of wrong,--"
26556,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,What is this thoughtless thing which thou hast done?
26557,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Lo, we have sought thee sorrowing, O my son!"
26558,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Few words he spake, and scarce of filial tone,"
26559,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Strange words, their sense a mystery yet unknown;"
26560,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Then turned with them and left the holy hill,"
26561,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,To all their mild commands obedient still.
26562,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The tale was told to Nazareth's sober men,"
26563,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,And Nazareth's matrons told it oft again;
26564,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The maids retold it at the fountain's side,"
26565,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The youthful shepherds doubted or denied;
26566,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"It passed around among the listening friends,"
26567,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"With all that fancy adds and fiction lends,"
26568,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Till newer marvels dimmed the young renown
26569,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Of Joseph's son, who talked the Rabbis down."
26570,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,

26573,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Till the dread morning rent the Temple's veil,"
26574,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,And shuddering earth confirmed the wondrous tale.

26928,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
26929,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,There was a look of horror flashed

26971,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And, in a bitter agony,"
26972,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,They clasped their buttered rolls.

26978,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
26979,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"What if the creature should arise,--"

26986,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"He took his hat from off the peg,"
26987,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,His coat from off the chair.
26988,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
26989,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Four freshmen fainted on the seat,"

27011,THE TOADSTOOL,"The lily shrinks, and the rose turns pale,"
27012,THE TOADSTOOL,"When they feel its breath in the summer gale,"
27013,THE TOADSTOOL,"And the tulip curls its leaves in pride,"
27014,THE TOADSTOOL,And the blue-eyed violet starts aside;
27015,THE TOADSTOOL,"But the lily may flaunt, and the tulip stare,"
27016,THE TOADSTOOL,For what does the honest toadstool care?
27017,THE TOADSTOOL,"She does not glow in a painted vest,"
27018,THE TOADSTOOL,And she never blooms on the maiden's breast;
27019,THE TOADSTOOL,"But she comes, as the saintly sisters do,"
27020,THE TOADSTOOL,In a modest suit of a Quaker hue.
27021,THE TOADSTOOL,"And, when the stars in the evening skies"

27026,THE TOADSTOOL,"Oh, there is light in her lover's glance,"
27027,THE TOADSTOOL,That flies to her heart like a silver lance;
27028,THE TOADSTOOL,"His breeches are made of spotted skin,"
27029,THE TOADSTOOL,"His jacket 'is tight, and his pumps are thin;"
27030,THE TOADSTOOL,"In a cloudless night you may hear his song,"

27032,THE TOADSTOOL,"And, if you will look by the moonlight fair,"
27033,THE TOADSTOOL,The trembling form of the toad is there.
27034,THE TOADSTOOL,
27035,THE TOADSTOOL,"And he twines his arms round her slender stem,"
27036,THE TOADSTOOL,In the shade of her velvet diadem;
27037,THE TOADSTOOL,"But she turns away in her maiden shame,"
27038,THE TOADSTOOL,And will not breathe on the kindling flame;
27039,THE TOADSTOOL,"He sings at her feet through the live-long night,"
27040,THE TOADSTOOL,And creeps to his cave at the break of light;
27041,THE TOADSTOOL,"And whenever he comes to the air above,"
27042,THE TOADSTOOL,His throat is swelling with baffled love.

27050,A BALLAD,
27051,A BALLAD,"IT was the stalwart butcher man,"
27052,A BALLAD,"That knit his swarthy brow,"
27053,A BALLAD,"And said the gentle Pig must die,"
27054,A BALLAD,And sealed it with a vow.
27055,A BALLAD,
27056,A BALLAD,And oh! it was the gentle Pig
27057,A BALLAD,"Lay stretched upon the ground,"
27058,A BALLAD,And ah! it was the cruel knife
27059,A BALLAD,His little heart that found.
27060,A BALLAD,
27061,A BALLAD,"They took him then, those wicked men,"
27062,A BALLAD,They trailed him all along;
27063,A BALLAD,"They put a stick between his lips,"
27064,A BALLAD,And through his heels a thong;
27065,A BALLAD,
27066,A BALLAD,And round and round an oaken beam
27067,A BALLAD,"A hempen cord they flung,"
27068,A BALLAD,"And, like a mighty pendulum,"
27069,A BALLAD,All solemnly he swung!
27070,A BALLAD,
27071,A BALLAD,"Now say thy prayers, thou sinful man,"
27072,A BALLAD,"And think what thou hast done,"
27073,A BALLAD,"And read thy catechism well,"
27074,A BALLAD,Thou bloody-minded one;
27075,A BALLAD,
27076,A BALLAD,"For if his sprite should walk by night,"
27077,A BALLAD,"It better were for thee,"
27078,A BALLAD,"That thou wert mouldering in the ground,"
27079,A BALLAD,Or bleaching in the sea.
27080,A BALLAD,
27081,A BALLAD,"It was the savage butcher then,"
27082,A BALLAD,"That made a mock of sin,"
27083,A BALLAD,"And swore a very wicked oath,"
27084,A BALLAD,He did not care a pin.
27085,A BALLAD,
27086,A BALLAD,"It was the butcher's youngest son,--"
27087,A BALLAD,"His voice was broke with sighs,"
27088,A BALLAD,And with his pocket-handkerchief
27089,A BALLAD,He wiped his little eyes;
27090,A BALLAD,
27091,A BALLAD,"All young and ignorant was he,"
27092,A BALLAD,"But innocent and mild,"
27093,A BALLAD,"And, in his soft simplicity,"
27094,A BALLAD,Out spoke the tender child:--
27095,A BALLAD,
27096,A BALLAD,"""Oh, father, father, list to me;"
27097,A BALLAD,"The Pig is deadly sick,"
27098,A BALLAD,"And men have hung him by his heels,"

27100,A BALLAD,
27101,A BALLAD,"It was the bloody butcher then,"
27102,A BALLAD,"That laughed as he would die,"
27103,A BALLAD,"Yet did he soothe the sorrowing child,"
27104,A BALLAD,And bid him not to cry;--
27105,A BALLAD,
27106,A BALLAD,"""Oh, Nathan, Nathan, what's a Pig,"
27107,A BALLAD,That thou shouldst weep and wail?
27108,A BALLAD,"Come, bear thee like a butcher's child,"
27109,A BALLAD,"And thou shalt have his tail!"""
27110,A BALLAD,
27111,A BALLAD,"It was the butcher's daughter then,"
27112,A BALLAD,"So slender and so fair,"
27113,A BALLAD,"That sobbed as it her heart would break,"
27114,A BALLAD,And tore her yellow hair;
27115,A BALLAD,
27116,A BALLAD,"And thus she spoke in thrilling tone,--"
27117,A BALLAD,Fast fell the tear-drops big:--
27118,A BALLAD,"""Ah! woe is me! Alas! Alas!"
27119,A BALLAD,"The Pig! The Pig! The Pig!"""
27120,A BALLAD,
27121,A BALLAD,Then did her wicked father's lips
27122,A BALLAD,"Make merry with her woe,"
27123,A BALLAD,"And call her many a naughty name,"
27124,A BALLAD,Because she whimpered so.
27125,A BALLAD,
27126,A BALLAD,"Ye need not weep, ye gentle ones,"
27127,A BALLAD,"In vain your tears are shed,"
27128,A BALLAD,"Ye cannot wash his crimson hand,"
27129,A BALLAD,Ye cannot soothe the dead.
27130,A BALLAD,
27131,A BALLAD,The bright sun folded on his breast
27132,A BALLAD,"His robes of rosy flame,"
27133,A BALLAD,And softly over all the west
27134,A BALLAD,The shades of evening came.
27135,A BALLAD,
27136,A BALLAD,"He slept, and troops of murdered Pigs"
27137,A BALLAD,Were busy with his dreams;
27138,A BALLAD,"Loud rang their wild, unearthly shrieks,"
27139,A BALLAD,Wide yawned their mortal seams.
27140,A BALLAD,
27141,A BALLAD,The clock struck twelve; the Dead hath heard;
27142,A BALLAD,"He opened both his eyes,"
27143,A BALLAD,And sullenly he shook his tail
27144,A BALLAD,To lash the feeding flies.
27145,A BALLAD,
27146,A BALLAD,"One quiver of the hempen cord,--"
27147,A BALLAD,"One struggle and one bound,--"
27148,A BALLAD,"With stiffened limb and leaden eye,"
27149,A BALLAD,The Pig was on the ground.
27150,A BALLAD,
27151,A BALLAD,And straight towards the sleeper's house
27152,A BALLAD,His fearful way he wended;
27153,A BALLAD,And hooting owl and hovering bat
27154,A BALLAD,On midnight wing attended.
27155,A BALLAD,
27156,A BALLAD,"Back flew the bolt, up rose the latch,"
27157,A BALLAD,"And open swung the door,"
27158,A BALLAD,And little mincing feet were heard
27159,A BALLAD,"Pat, pat along the floor."
27160,A BALLAD,
27161,A BALLAD,"Two hoofs upon the sanded floor,"
27162,A BALLAD,And two upon the bed;
27163,A BALLAD,"And they are breathing side by side,"
27164,A BALLAD,The living and the dead!
27165,A BALLAD,
27166,A BALLAD,"""Now wake, now wake, thou butcher man!"
27167,A BALLAD,What makes thy cheek so pale?
27168,A BALLAD,Take hold! take hold! thou dost not fear
27169,A BALLAD,"To clasp a spectre's tail?"""
27170,A BALLAD,
27171,A BALLAD,Untwisted every winding coil;
27172,A BALLAD,"The shuddering wretch took hold,"
27173,A BALLAD,"All like an icicle it seemed,"
27174,A BALLAD,So tapering and so cold.
27175,A BALLAD,
27176,A BALLAD,"""Thou com'st with me, thou butcher man!""--"
27177,A BALLAD,"He strives to loose his grasp,"
27178,A BALLAD,"But, faster than the clinging vine,"
27179,A BALLAD,Those twining spirals clasp;
27180,A BALLAD,
27181,A BALLAD,"And open, open swung the door,"
27182,A BALLAD,"And, fleeter than the wind,"
27183,A BALLAD,"The shadowy spectre swept before,"
27184,A BALLAD,The butcher trailed behind.
27185,A BALLAD,
27186,A BALLAD,"Fast fled the darkness of the night,"
27187,A BALLAD,And morn rose faint and dim;
27188,A BALLAD,"They called full loud, they knocked full long,"
27189,A BALLAD,They did not waken him.
27190,A BALLAD,
27191,A BALLAD,"Straight, straight towards that oaken beam,"
27192,A BALLAD,A trampled pathway ran;
27193,A BALLAD,"A ghastly shape was swinging there,--"
27194,A BALLAD,It was the butcher man.
