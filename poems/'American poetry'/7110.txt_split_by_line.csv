114,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
115,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"O wayward rose, why dost thou wreathe so high,"
116,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Wasting thyself in sweet-breath'd ecstasy?
117,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
118,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""The pulses of the wind my life uplift,"
119,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,And through my sprays I feel the sunlight sift;
120,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
121,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""And all my fibres, in a quick consent"
122,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"Entwined, aspire to fill their heavenward bent."
123,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
124,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""I feel the shaking of the far-off sea,"
125,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,And all things growing blend their life with me:
126,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
127,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""When men and women on me look, there glows"
128,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Within my veins a life not of the rose.
129,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
130,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""Then let me grow, until I touch the sky,"
131,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"And let me grow and grow until I die!"""
132,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
133,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"So, every year, the sweet rose shooteth higher,"
134,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"And scales the roof upon its wings of fire,"
135,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
136,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"And pricks the air, in lovely discontent,"
137,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,With thorns that question still of its intent.
138,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
139,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"But when it reached the roof-tree, there it clung,"
140,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Nor ever farther up its blossoms flung.
141,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
142,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"O wayward rose, why hast thou ceased to climb?"
143,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Hast thou forgot the ardor of thy prime?
144,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
145,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""O hearken!""--thus the rose-spray, listening,--"
146,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""With what weird music sweet these full hearts ring!"
147,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
148,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""What mazy ripples of deep, eddying sound,"
149,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"Rise, touch the roof-tree old, and drift around,"
150,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
151,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""Bearing aloft the burden musical"
152,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Of joys and griefs from human hearts that fall!
153,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
154,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""Green stem and fair, flush'd circle I will lay"
155,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"Along the roof, and listen here alway;"
156,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
157,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""For rose and tree, and every leafy growth"

160,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""No purpose hath save this, to breathe a grace"
161,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"O'er men, and in men's hearts to seek a place."
162,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
163,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"""Therefore, O poet, thou who gav'st to me"
164,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"The homage of thy humble sympathy,"
165,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,

172,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"A hundred turbulent blossoms of the rose,"
173,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
174,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Full of the voices of the sea and grove
175,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,"And air, and full of hidden, murmured love,"
176,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,
177,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,And warm with passion through the roof-tree sent;
178,ROSE AND ROOF-TREE.,Dew-drenched with tears;--all in one wild gush spent!

183,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,
184,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,Music is in all growing things;
185,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,And underneath the silky wings
186,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,Of smallest insects there is stirred
187,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,A pulse of air that must be heard.
188,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,"Earth's silence lives, and throbs, and sings."
189,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,
190,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,If poet from the vibrant strings
191,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,"Of his poor heart a measure flings,"
192,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,"Laugh not, that he no trumpet blows:"
193,MUSIC OF GROWTH.,It may be that Heaven hears and knows

199,A SONG LONG AGO.,
200,A SONG LONG AGO.,Through the pauses of thy fervid singing
201,A SONG LONG AGO.,Fell crystal sound
202,A SONG LONG AGO.,That thy fingers from the keys were flinging
203,A SONG LONG AGO.,Lightly around:
204,A SONG LONG AGO.,I felt the vine-like harmonies close clinging
205,A SONG LONG AGO.,About my soul;
206,A SONG LONG AGO.,"And to my eyes, as fruit of their sweet bringing,"
207,A SONG LONG AGO.,The full tear stole!

219,MELANCHOLY.,"'Bide thou with me,"
220,MELANCHOLY.,Sweet Melancholy!
221,MELANCHOLY.,"As purple shadows to the tree,"
222,MELANCHOLY.,When the last sun-rays sadly slope

230,CONTENTMENT.,
231,CONTENTMENT.,Glad hours have been when I have seen
232,CONTENTMENT.,Life's scope and each dry day's intent

234,CONTENTMENT.,"In silence, covering with my hand"
235,CONTENTMENT.,"The circle of the universe,"
236,CONTENTMENT.,"Balance the blessing and the curse,"
237,CONTENTMENT.,"And trust in deeds without chagrin,"

246,AN APRIL ARIA.,AN APRIL ARIA.
247,AN APRIL ARIA.,
248,AN APRIL ARIA.,When the mornings dankly fall
249,AN APRIL ARIA.,"With a dim forethought of rain,"
250,AN APRIL ARIA.,And the robins richly call
251,AN APRIL ARIA.,"To their mates mercurial,"
252,AN APRIL ARIA.,And the tree-boughs creak and strain
253,AN APRIL ARIA.,In the wind;
254,AN APRIL ARIA.,"When the river's rough with foam,"
255,AN APRIL ARIA.,"And the new-made clearings smoke,"
256,AN APRIL ARIA.,And the clouds that go and come
257,AN APRIL ARIA.,"Shine and darken frolicsome,"
258,AN APRIL ARIA.,And the frogs at evening croak
259,AN APRIL ARIA.,Undefined
260,AN APRIL ARIA.,"Mysteries of monotone,"
261,AN APRIL ARIA.,And by melting beds of snow
262,AN APRIL ARIA.,Wind-flowers blossom all alone;
263,AN APRIL ARIA.,Then I know
264,AN APRIL ARIA.,That the bitter winter's dead.
265,AN APRIL ARIA.,Over his head
266,AN APRIL ARIA.,"The damp sod breaks so mellow,--"
267,AN APRIL ARIA.,"Its mosses tipped with points of yellow,--"
268,AN APRIL ARIA.,I cannot but be glad;
269,AN APRIL ARIA.,Yet this sweet mood will borrow
270,AN APRIL ARIA.,"Something of a sweeter sorrow,"
271,AN APRIL ARIA.,To touch and turn me sad.
272,AN APRIL ARIA.,

275,THE BOBOLINK.,THE BOBOLINK.
276,THE BOBOLINK.,
277,THE BOBOLINK.,"How sweetly sang the bobolink,"
278,THE BOBOLINK.,"When thou, my Love, wast nigh!"
279,THE BOBOLINK.,His liquid music from the brink
280,THE BOBOLINK.,"Of some cloud-fountain seemed to sink,"
281,THE BOBOLINK.,Built in the blue-domed sky.
282,THE BOBOLINK.,
283,THE BOBOLINK.,How sadly sings the bobolink!
284,THE BOBOLINK.,No more my Love is nigh:
285,THE BOBOLINK.,"Yet rise, my spirit, rise, and drink"
286,THE BOBOLINK.,"Once more from that cloud-fountain's brink,--"
287,THE BOBOLINK.,Once more before I die!

292,THE SUN-SHOWER.,
293,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"A penciled shade the sky doth sweep,"
294,THE SUN-SHOWER.,And transient glooms creep in to sleep
295,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Amid the orchard;
296,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Fantastic breezes pull the trees
297,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Hither and yon, to vagaries"
298,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Of aspect tortured.
299,THE SUN-SHOWER.,
300,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Then, like the downcast dreamy fringe"
301,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Of eyelids, when dim gates unhinge"
302,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"That locked their tears,"
303,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Falls on the hills a mist of rain,--"
304,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"So faint, it seems to fade again;"
305,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Yet swiftly nears.
306,THE SUN-SHOWER.,
307,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Now sparkles the air, all steely-bright,"
308,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"With drops swept down in arrow-flight,"
309,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"Keen, quivering lines."
310,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Ceased in a breath the showery sound;
311,THE SUN-SHOWER.,"And teasingly, now, as I look around,"
312,THE SUN-SHOWER.,Sweet sunlight shines!

316,JUNE LONGINGS.,JUNE LONGINGS.
317,JUNE LONGINGS.,
318,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Lo, all about the lofty blue are blown"
319,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Light vapors white, like thistle-down,"
320,JUNE LONGINGS.,That from their softened silver heaps opaque
321,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Scatter delicate flake by flake,"
322,JUNE LONGINGS.,Upon the wide loom of the heavens weaving
323,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Forms of fancies past believing,"
324,JUNE LONGINGS.,"And, with fantastic show of mute despair,"
325,JUNE LONGINGS.,"As for some sweet hope hurt beyond repair,"
326,JUNE LONGINGS.,Melt in the silent voids of sunny air.
327,JUNE LONGINGS.,
328,JUNE LONGINGS.,All day the cooing brooklet runs in tune:
329,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Half sunk i' th' blue, the powdery moon"
330,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Shows whitely. Hark, the bobolink's note! I hear it,"
331,JUNE LONGINGS.,Far and faint as a fairy spirit!
332,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Yet all these pass, and as some blithe bird, winging,"
333,JUNE LONGINGS.,"Leaves a heart-ache for his singing,"
334,JUNE LONGINGS.,A frustrate passion haunts me evermore
335,JUNE LONGINGS.,For that which closest dwells to beauty's core.
336,JUNE LONGINGS.,"O Love, canst thou this heart of hope restore?"

340,A RUNE OF THE RAIN.,A RUNE OF THE RAIN.
341,A RUNE OF THE RAIN.,
342,I.,I.
343,I.,
344,I.,O many-toned rain!
345,I.,O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
346,I.,How welcome is its delicate overture
347,I.,"At evening, when the glowing-moistur'd west"
348,I.,Seals all things with cool promise of night's rest!
349,I.,
350,I.,At first it would allure
351,I.,"The earth to kinder mood,"
352,I.,With dainty flattering
353,I.,"Of soft, sweet pattering:"
354,I.,Faintly now you hear the tramp
355,I.,Of the fine drops falling damp
356,I.,"On the dry, sun-seasoned ground"
357,I.,And the thirsty leaves around.
358,I.,"But anon, imbued"
359,I.,"With a sudden, bounding access"
360,I.,"Of passion, it relaxes"
361,I.,"All timider persuasion,"
362,I.,"And, with nor pretext nor occasion,"
363,I.,Its wooing redoubles;
364,I.,"And pounds the ground, and bubbles"
365,I.,"In sputtering spray,"
366,I.,Flinging itself in a fury
367,I.,Of flashing white away;
368,I.,Till the dusty road
369,I.,"Flings a perfume dank abroad,"
370,I.,"And the grass, and the wide-hung trees,"
371,I.,"The vines, the flowers in their beds,"
372,I.,The vivid corn that to the breeze
373,I.,"Rustles along the garden-rows,"
374,I.,"Visibly lift their heads,--"
375,I.,"And, as the shower wilder grows,"
376,I.,Upleap with answering kisses to the rain.
377,I.,
378,I.,"Then, the slow and pleasant murmur"
379,I.,"Of its subsiding,"
380,I.,"As the pulse of the storm beats firmer,"
381,I.,And the steady rain
382,I.,Drops into a cadenced chiding.
383,I.,"Deep-breathing rain,"
384,I.,The sad and ghostly noise
385,I.,"Wherewith thou dost complain,--"
386,I.,"Thy plaintive, spiritual voice,"
387,I.,Heard thus at close of day
388,I.,"Through vaults of twilight-gray,--"
389,I.,Doth vex me with sweet pain!
390,I.,And still my soul is fain
391,I.,To know the secret of that yearning
392,I.,Which in thine utterance I hear returning.
393,I.,
394,I.,"Hush, oh hush!"
395,I.,Break not the dreamy rush
396,I.,Of the rain:
397,I.,Touch not the marring doubt
398,I.,"Words bring, to the certainty"
399,I.,"Of its soft refrain,"
400,I.,But let the flying fringes flout
401,I.,"Their gouts against the pane,"
402,I.,And the gurgling throat of the water-spout
403,I.,Groan in the eaves amain.
404,I.,
405,I.,The earth is wedded to the shower.
406,I.,"Darkness and awe, gird round the bridal-hour!"
407,I.,
408,I.,
409,II.,II.
410,II.,
411,II.,O many-tonèd rain!
412,II.,It hath caught the strain
413,II.,"Of a wilder tune,"
414,II.,"Ere the same night's noon,"
415,II.,"When dreams and sleep forsake me,"
416,II.,"And sudden dread doth wake me,"
417,II.,To hear the booming drums of heaven beat
418,II.,"The long roll to battle; when the knotted cloud,"
419,II.,"With an echoing loud,"
420,II.,Bursts asunder
421,II.,At the sudden resurrection of the thunder;
422,II.,"And the fountains of the air,"
423,II.,"Unsealed again sweep, ruining, everywhere,"
424,II.,To wrap the world in a watery winding-sheet.
425,II.,
426,II.,
427,III.,III.
428,III.,
429,III.,O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
430,III.,"When the airy war doth wane,"
431,III.,"And the storm to the east hath flown,"
432,III.,"Cloaked close in the whirling wind,"
433,III.,There's a voice still left behind
434,III.,"In each heavy-hearted tree,"
435,III.,Charged with tearful memory
436,III.,Of the vanished rain:
437,III.,From their leafy lashes wet
438,III.,Drip the dews of fresh regret
439,III.,For the lover that's gone!
440,III.,All else is still.
441,III.,But the stars are listening;
442,III.,And low o'er the wooded hill
443,III.,"Hangs, upon listless wing"
444,III.,"Outspread, a shape of damp, blue cloud,"
445,III.,"Watching, like a bird of evil"
446,III.,"That knows no mercy nor reprieval,"
447,III.,The slow and silent death of the pallid moon.
448,III.,
449,III.,
450,IV.,IV.
451,IV.,
452,IV.,"But soon, returning duly,"
453,IV.,Dawn whitens the wet hill-tops bluely.
454,IV.,To her vision pure and cold
455,IV.,The night's wild tale is told
456,IV.,"On the glistening leaf, in the mid-road pool,"
457,IV.,"The garden mold turned dark and cool,"
458,IV.,And the meadow's trampled acres.
459,IV.,"But hark, how fresh the song of the winged music-makers!"
460,IV.,"For now the moanings bitter,"
461,IV.,"Left by the rain, make harmony"
462,IV.,"With the swallow's matin-twitter,"
463,IV.,"And the robin's note, like the wind's in a tree:"
464,IV.,"The infant morning breathes sweet breath,"
465,IV.,And with it is blent
466,IV.,"The wistful, wild, moist scent"
467,IV.,Of the grass in the marsh which the sea nourisheth:
468,IV.,And behold!
469,IV.,"The last reluctant drop of the storm,"
470,IV.,"Wrung from the roof, is smitten warm"
471,IV.,And turned to gold;
472,IV.,For in its veins doth run
473,IV.,"The very blood of the bold, unsullied sun!"
474,IV.,
475,IV.,
476,IV.,
477,THE SONG-SPARROW.,THE SONG-SPARROW.
478,THE SONG-SPARROW.,
479,THE SONG-SPARROW.,Glimmers gray the leafless thicket
480,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Close beside my garden gate,"
481,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Where, so light, from post to picket"
482,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Hops the sparrow, blithe, sedate;"
483,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Who, with meekly folded wing,"
484,THE SONG-SPARROW.,Comes to sun himself and sing.
485,THE SONG-SPARROW.,
486,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"It was there, perhaps, last year,"
487,THE SONG-SPARROW.,That his little house he built;
488,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"For he seems to perk and peer,"
489,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"And to twitter, too, and tilt"
490,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"The bare branches in between,"
491,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"With a fond, familiar mien."
492,THE SONG-SPARROW.,
493,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Once, I know, there was a nest,"
494,THE SONG-SPARROW.,Held there by the sideward thrust
495,THE SONG-SPARROW.,Of those twigs that touch his breast;
496,THE SONG-SPARROW.,Though 'tis gone now. Some rude gust
497,THE SONG-SPARROW.,"Caught it, over-full of snow,--"

1332,JESSAMINE.,_And the moon hangs low in the elm_.
1333,JESSAMINE.,
1334,JESSAMINE.,At last she heard no more. The neighbors said

1350,JESSAMINE.,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
1351,JESSAMINE.,
1352,JESSAMINE.,Nor none could hope for her. But she had grown

1376,JESSAMINE.,Even to the tree-top sang the wedding-bell;

1396,GRIEF'S HERO.,
1397,GRIEF'S HERO.,"Grief took him, and with master-touch"
1398,GRIEF'S HERO.,Molded his being. I marveled much

1405,GRIEF'S HERO.,With liquid fire she filled his eyes.
1406,GRIEF'S HERO.,She graced his lips with swift surmise
1407,GRIEF'S HERO.,"Of sympathy for others' woe,"
1408,GRIEF'S HERO.,And made his every fibre flow
1409,GRIEF'S HERO.,In fairer curves. On brow and chin

1424,GRIEF'S HERO.,"But, saturated with success,"
1425,GRIEF'S HERO.,Well-guarded by a soft excess
1426,GRIEF'S HERO.,"Of bodily ease, gave little heed"
1427,GRIEF'S HERO.,"To him that held not by their creed,"
1428,GRIEF'S HERO.,Save o'er the beauteous youth to moan:

1967,THE SILENT TIDE,Alike by rain and sunshine sadly stained.
1968,THE SILENT TIDE,A quiet country-road before the door
1969,THE SILENT TIDE,"Runs, gathering close its ruts to scale the hill--"
1970,THE SILENT TIDE,"A sudden bluff on the New Hampshire coast,"
1971,THE SILENT TIDE,"That rises rough against the sea, and hangs"
1972,THE SILENT TIDE,Crested above the bowlder-sprinkled beach.
1973,THE SILENT TIDE,And on the road white houses small are strung
1974,THE SILENT TIDE,"Like threaded beads, with intervals. The church"
1975,THE SILENT TIDE,Tops the rough hill; then comes the wheelwright's shop.
1976,THE SILENT TIDE,

1978,THE SILENT TIDE,And from the farm-house windows see it strike

1980,THE SILENT TIDE,
1981,THE SILENT TIDE,"Sea-like, too, echoing round me here there rolls"
1982,THE SILENT TIDE,A surging sorrow; and even so there breaks

1987,THE SILENT TIDE,By early orphanage and solitude
1988,THE SILENT TIDE,"The closer, cleaving strongly each to each,"
1989,THE SILENT TIDE,"Till love, that held them many years in gage,"
1990,THE SILENT TIDE,Itself swept them asunder. I have heard
1991,THE SILENT TIDE,"The story from old Deacon Snow, their friend,"
1992,THE SILENT TIDE,He who was boy and man with them. A boy!
1993,THE SILENT TIDE,"What, he? How strange it seems! who now is stiff"
1994,THE SILENT TIDE,And warped with life's fierce heat and cold: his brows
1995,THE SILENT TIDE,"Are hoary white, and on his head the hairs"
1996,THE SILENT TIDE,Stand sparse as wheat-stalks on the bare field's edge!
1997,THE SILENT TIDE,
1998,THE SILENT TIDE,Reuben and Jerry they were named; but two
1999,THE SILENT TIDE,Of common blood and nurture scarce were found
2000,THE SILENT TIDE,"More sharply different. For the first was bold,"
2001,THE SILENT TIDE,"Breeze-like and bold to come or go; not rash,"
2002,THE SILENT TIDE,"But shrewdly generous, popular, and boon:"
2003,THE SILENT TIDE,"And Jerry, dark and sad-faced. Whether least"
2004,THE SILENT TIDE,"He loved himself or neighbor none could tell,"
2005,THE SILENT TIDE,So cold he seemed in wonted sympathy.
2006,THE SILENT TIDE,Yet he would ponder an hour at a time
2007,THE SILENT TIDE,Upon a bird found dead; and much he loved
2008,THE SILENT TIDE,To brood i' th' shade of yon wind-wavered pines.
2009,THE SILENT TIDE,"Often at night, too, he would wander forth,"
2010,THE SILENT TIDE,Lured by the hollow rumbling of the sea
2011,THE SILENT TIDE,"In moonlight breaking, there to learn wild things,"
2012,THE SILENT TIDE,Such as these dreamers pluck out of the dusk
2013,THE SILENT TIDE,"While other men lie sleeping. But a star,"
2014,THE SILENT TIDE,"Rose on his sight, at last, with power to rule"
2015,THE SILENT TIDE,"Majestically mild that deep-domed sky,"
2016,THE SILENT TIDE,"High as youth's hopes, that stood above his soul;"
2017,THE SILENT TIDE,"And, ruling, led him dayward. That was Grace,"
2018,THE SILENT TIDE,"I mean Grace Brierly, daughter of the squire,"
2019,THE SILENT TIDE,Rivaling the wheelwright Hungerford's shy Ruth
2020,THE SILENT TIDE,"For beauty. Therefore, in the sunny field,"
2021,THE SILENT TIDE,"Mowing the clover-purpled grass, or, waked"
2022,THE SILENT TIDE,"In keen December dawns,--while creeping light"
2023,THE SILENT TIDE,And winter-tides beneath the pallid stars
2024,THE SILENT TIDE,"Stole o'er the marsh together,--a thought of her"
2025,THE SILENT TIDE,"Would turn him cool or warm, like the south breeze,"
2026,THE SILENT TIDE,And make him blithe or bitter. Alas for him!
2027,THE SILENT TIDE,"Eagerly storing golden thoughts of her,"
2028,THE SILENT TIDE,He locked a phantom treasure in his breast.
2029,THE SILENT TIDE,
2030,THE SILENT TIDE,"He sought to chain the breezes, and to lift"
2031,THE SILENT TIDE,A perfume as a pearl before his eyes--
2032,THE SILENT TIDE,Intangible delight! A time drew on
2033,THE SILENT TIDE,When from these twilight musings on his hopes
2034,THE SILENT TIDE,"He woke, and found the morning of his love"
2035,THE SILENT TIDE,"Blasted, and all its rays shorn suddenly."
2036,THE SILENT TIDE,"For Reuben, too, had turned his eye on Grace,"
2037,THE SILENT TIDE,"And she with favoring face the suit had met,"
2038,THE SILENT TIDE,Known in the village; this dream-fettered youth
2039,THE SILENT TIDE,"Perceiving not what passed, until too late."
2040,THE SILENT TIDE,
2041,THE SILENT TIDE,One holiday the young folks all had gone
2042,THE SILENT TIDE,"Strawberrying, with the village Sabbath-school;"
2043,THE SILENT TIDE,"Reuben and Grace and Jerry, Ruth, Rob Snow,"
2044,THE SILENT TIDE,"And all their friends, youth-mates that buoyantly"
2045,THE SILENT TIDE,"Bore out 'gainst Time's armadas, like a fleet"
2046,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of fair ships, sunlit, braced by buffeting winds,"
2047,THE SILENT TIDE,"Indomitably brave; but, soon or late,"
2048,THE SILENT TIDE,Battle and hurricane or whirl them deep
2049,THE SILENT TIDE,"Below to death, or send them homeward, seared"
2050,THE SILENT TIDE,"By shot and storm: so went they forth, that day."
2051,THE SILENT TIDE,
2052,THE SILENT TIDE,Two wagons full of rosy children rolled
2053,THE SILENT TIDE,"Along the rutty track, 'twixt swamp and slope,"
2054,THE SILENT TIDE,"Through deep, green-glimmering woods, and out at last"
2055,THE SILENT TIDE,"On grassy table-land, warm with the sun"
2056,THE SILENT TIDE,And yielding tributary odors wild
2057,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of strawberry, late June-rose, juniper,"
2058,THE SILENT TIDE,Where sea and land breeze mingled. There a brook
2059,THE SILENT TIDE,"Through a bare hollow flashing, spurted, purled,"
2060,THE SILENT TIDE,"And shot away, yet stayed--a light and grace"
2061,THE SILENT TIDE,"Unconscious and unceasing. And thick pines,"
2062,THE SILENT TIDE,"Hard by, drew darkly far away their dim"
2063,THE SILENT TIDE,"And sheltering, cool arcades. So all dismount,"
2064,THE SILENT TIDE,And fields and forest gladden with their shout;
2065,THE SILENT TIDE,"Ball, swing, and see-saw sending the light hearts"
2066,THE SILENT TIDE,Of the children high o'er earth and everything.
2067,THE SILENT TIDE,"While some staid, kindly women draw and spread"
2068,THE SILENT TIDE,"In pine-shade the long whiteness of a cloth,"
2069,THE SILENT TIDE,"The rest, a busy legion, o'er the grass"

2075,THE SILENT TIDE,"Its round, with winds and waters, tunefully,"
2076,THE SILENT TIDE,"And birds made music in the matted wood,"
2077,THE SILENT TIDE,The shaft of death reached Jerry's heart: he saw
2078,THE SILENT TIDE,"The sweet conspiracy of those two lives,"
2079,THE SILENT TIDE,"In looks and gestures read his doom, and heard"
2080,THE SILENT TIDE,Their laughter ring to the grave all mirth of his.
2081,THE SILENT TIDE,
2082,THE SILENT TIDE,"So Reuben's life in full leaf stood, its fruit"
2083,THE SILENT TIDE,Hidden in a green expectancy; but all
2084,THE SILENT TIDE,His days were rounded with ripe consciousness:
2085,THE SILENT TIDE,"While Jerry felt the winter's whitening blight,"
2086,THE SILENT TIDE,As when that frosty fern-work and those palms
2087,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of visionary leaf, and trailing vines,"
2088,THE SILENT TIDE,"Quaint-chased by night-winds on the pane, melt off,"
2089,THE SILENT TIDE,"And naked earth, stone-stiff, with bristling trees,"
2090,THE SILENT TIDE,Stares in the winter sunlight coldly through.
2091,THE SILENT TIDE,"But yet he rose, and clothed himself amain"
2092,THE SILENT TIDE,"With misery, and once more put on life"
2093,THE SILENT TIDE,As a stained garment. Highly he resolved
2094,THE SILENT TIDE,To make his deedless days henceforward strike
2095,THE SILENT TIDE,Pure harmony--a psalm of silences.
2096,THE SILENT TIDE,
2097,THE SILENT TIDE,"But on the Sunday, coming from the church,"
2098,THE SILENT TIDE,"He saw those happy, plighted lovers walk"
2099,THE SILENT TIDE,"Before proud Grace's father, and of friends"
2100,THE SILENT TIDE,Heard comment and congratulation given.
2101,THE SILENT TIDE,"Then with Rob Snow he hurried to the beach,"
2102,THE SILENT TIDE,To a rough heap of stones they two had reared
2103,THE SILENT TIDE,In boyhood. There the two held sad debate
2104,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of life's swift losses, Bob inspiriting still,"
2105,THE SILENT TIDE,"Jerry rejecting hope, ev'n though his friend,"
2106,THE SILENT TIDE,"Self-wounding (for he loved Ruth Hungerford),"
2107,THE SILENT TIDE,"Told how the wheelwright's daughter longed for him,"
2108,THE SILENT TIDE,"And yet might make him glad, though Grace was lost."
2109,THE SILENT TIDE,
2110,THE SILENT TIDE,"The season deepened, and in Jerry's heart"
2111,THE SILENT TIDE,Ripened a thought charged with grave consequence.
2112,THE SILENT TIDE,"His grief he would have stifled at its birth,"
2113,THE SILENT TIDE,Sad child of frustrate longing! But anon--
2114,THE SILENT TIDE,"Knowledge of Ruth's affection being revealed,"
2115,THE SILENT TIDE,"Which, if he stayed to let it feed on him,"
2116,THE SILENT TIDE,"Vine-like might wreathe and wind about his life,"
2117,THE SILENT TIDE,Lifting all shade and sweetness out of reach
2118,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of Robert, so long his friend--honor, and hopes"
2119,THE SILENT TIDE,"He would not name, kindled a torch for war"
2120,THE SILENT TIDE,Of various impulse in him. Reuben wedded;
2121,THE SILENT TIDE,"Yet Jerry lingered. Then, swift whisperings"
2122,THE SILENT TIDE,Along reverberant walls of gossips' ears
2123,THE SILENT TIDE,"Hummed loud and louder a love for Ruth. Grace, too,"
2124,THE SILENT TIDE,Involved him in a web of soft surmise
2125,THE SILENT TIDE,With Ruth; and Reuben questioned him thereof.
2126,THE SILENT TIDE,"But a white, sudden anger struck like a bolt"
2127,THE SILENT TIDE,"O'er Jerry's face, that blackened under it:"
2128,THE SILENT TIDE,"He strode away, and left his brother dazed,"
2129,THE SILENT TIDE,With red rush of offended self-conceit
2130,THE SILENT TIDE,Staining his forehead to the hair. This flash
2131,THE SILENT TIDE,Of anger--first since boyhood's wholesome strifes--
2132,THE SILENT TIDE,On Jerry's path gleamed lurid; by its light
2133,THE SILENT TIDE,He shaped a life's course out.
2134,THE SILENT TIDE,
2135,THE SILENT TIDE,There came a storm
2136,THE SILENT TIDE,One night. He bade farewell to Ruth; and when
2137,THE SILENT TIDE,"Above the seas the bare-browed dawn arose,"
2138,THE SILENT TIDE,"While the last laggard drops ran off the eaves,"
2139,THE SILENT TIDE,"He dressed, but took some customary garb"
2140,THE SILENT TIDE,On his arm; stole swiftly to the sands; and there
2141,THE SILENT TIDE,Cast clown his garments by the ancient heap
2142,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of stones. At first brief pause he made, and thought:"
2143,THE SILENT TIDE,"""And thus I play, to win perchance a tear"
2144,THE SILENT TIDE,"From her whom, first, to save the smallest care,"
2145,THE SILENT TIDE,"I thought I could have died!"" But then at once"
2146,THE SILENT TIDE,Within the sweep of swirling water-planes
2147,THE SILENT TIDE,That from the great waves circled up and slid
2148,THE SILENT TIDE,"Instantly back, passing far down the shore,"
2149,THE SILENT TIDE,Southward he made his way. Next day he shipped
2150,THE SILENT TIDE,Upon a whaler outward bound. She spread
2151,THE SILENT TIDE,"Her mighty wings, and bore him far away--"
2152,THE SILENT TIDE,"So far, Death seemed across her wake to stalk,"
2153,THE SILENT TIDE,"Withering her swift shape from the empty air,"
2154,THE SILENT TIDE,Until her memory grew a faded dream.
2155,THE SILENT TIDE,
2156,THE SILENT TIDE,"Ah, what a desolate brightness that young day"
2157,THE SILENT TIDE,Flung o'er the impassive strand and dull green marsh
2158,THE SILENT TIDE,"And green-arched orchard, ere it struck the farm!"
2159,THE SILENT TIDE,"Storm-strengthened, clear, and cool the morning rose"
2160,THE SILENT TIDE,"To gaze down on that frighted home, where dawned"
2161,THE SILENT TIDE,"Pale Ruth's discovery of her loss, who late,"
2162,THE SILENT TIDE,Guessing some ill in Jerry's last-night words
2163,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of vague farewell, woke now to certainty"
2164,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of strange disaster. So, when Reuben and Rob,"
2165,THE SILENT TIDE,"Hither and thither searching, with locked lips"
2166,THE SILENT TIDE,"And eyes grown suddenly cold in eager dread,"
2167,THE SILENT TIDE,"On those still sands beside the untamed sea,"
2168,THE SILENT TIDE,"Came to the garments Jerry had thrown there, dumb"
2169,THE SILENT TIDE,"They stood, and knew he'd perished. If by chance"
2170,THE SILENT TIDE,Borne out with undertow and rolled beneath
2171,THE SILENT TIDE,"The gaping surge, or rushing on his death"
2172,THE SILENT TIDE,"Free-willed, they would not guess; but straight they set"
2173,THE SILENT TIDE,Themselves to watch the changes of the sea--
2174,THE SILENT TIDE,"The watchful sea that would not be betrayed,"
2175,THE SILENT TIDE,The surly flood that echoed their suspense
2176,THE SILENT TIDE,With hollow-sounding horror. Thus three tides
2177,THE SILENT TIDE,"Hurled on the beach their empty spray, and brought"
2178,THE SILENT TIDE,"Nor doubt-dispelling death, nor new-born hope."
2179,THE SILENT TIDE,But with the fourth slow turn at length there came
2180,THE SILENT TIDE,"A naked, drifting body impelled to shore,"
2181,THE SILENT TIDE,An unknown sailor by the late storm swept
2182,THE SILENT TIDE,Out of the rigging of some laboring ship.
2183,THE SILENT TIDE,"And him, disfigured by the water's wear,"
2184,THE SILENT TIDE,"The watching friends supposed their dead; and so,"
2185,THE SILENT TIDE,"Mourning, took up this outcast of the deep,"
2186,THE SILENT TIDE,"And buried him, with church-rite and with pall"
2187,THE SILENT TIDE,"Trailing, and train of sad-eyed mourners, there"
2188,THE SILENT TIDE,In the old orchard-lot by Reuben's door.
2189,THE SILENT TIDE,
2190,THE SILENT TIDE,Observed among the mourners walked slight Ruth.
2191,THE SILENT TIDE,Her grief had dropped a veil of finer light
2192,THE SILENT TIDE,"Around her, hedging her with sanctity"
2193,THE SILENT TIDE,Peculiar; all stood shy about her save
2194,THE SILENT TIDE,"Rob Snow, he venturing from time to time"
2195,THE SILENT TIDE,"Some small, uncertain act of kindliness."
2196,THE SILENT TIDE,"Long seemed she vowed from joy, but when the birds"
2197,THE SILENT TIDE,"Began to mate, and quiet violets blow"
2198,THE SILENT TIDE,"Along the brook-side, lo! she smiled again;"
2199,THE SILENT TIDE,Again the wind-flower color in her cheeks
2200,THE SILENT TIDE,"Blanch'd in a breath, and bloomed once more; then stayed;"
2201,THE SILENT TIDE,"Till, like the breeze that rumors ripening buds,"
2202,THE SILENT TIDE,A delicate sense crept through the air that soon
2203,THE SILENT TIDE,"These two would scale the church-crowned hill, and wed."
2204,THE SILENT TIDE,
2205,THE SILENT TIDE,"The seasons faced the world, and fled, and came."
2206,THE SILENT TIDE,"In summer nights, the soft roll of the sea"
2207,THE SILENT TIDE,"Was shattered, resonant, beneath a moon"
2208,THE SILENT TIDE,"That, silent, seemed to hearken. And every hour"
2209,THE SILENT TIDE,"In autumn, night or day, large apples fell"
2210,THE SILENT TIDE,"Without rebound to earth, upon the sod"
2211,THE SILENT TIDE,There mounded greenly by the large slate slab
2212,THE SILENT TIDE,In the old orchard-lot near Reuben's door.
2213,THE SILENT TIDE,But there were changes: after some long years
2214,THE SILENT TIDE,Reuben and Grace beheld a brave young boy
2215,THE SILENT TIDE,Bearing their double life abroad in one--
2216,THE SILENT TIDE,"Beginning new the world, and bringing hopes"
2217,THE SILENT TIDE,That in their path fell flower-like. Not at ease
2218,THE SILENT TIDE,"They dwelt, though; for a slow discordancy"
2219,THE SILENT TIDE,Of temper--weak-willed waste of life in bursts
2220,THE SILENT TIDE,Of petulance--had marred their happiness.
2221,THE SILENT TIDE,"And so the boy, young Reuben, as he grew,"
2222,THE SILENT TIDE,Was chafed and vexed by this ill-fitting mode
2223,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of life forced on him, and rebelled. Too oft"
2224,THE SILENT TIDE,"Brooding alone, he shaped loose schemes of flight"
2225,THE SILENT TIDE,"Into the joyous outer world, to break"
2226,THE SILENT TIDE,From the unwholesome wranglings of his home.
2227,THE SILENT TIDE,"Then once, when at some slight demur he made,"
2228,THE SILENT TIDE,"Dispute ensued between the man and wife,"
2229,THE SILENT TIDE,"He burst forth, goaded, ""Some day I will leave--"
2230,THE SILENT TIDE,"Leave you forever!"" And his father stared,"
2231,THE SILENT TIDE,"Lifted and clenched his hand, but let it unloose,"
2232,THE SILENT TIDE,"Nerveless. The blow, unstruck, yet quivered through"
2233,THE SILENT TIDE,The boy's whole body.
2234,THE SILENT TIDE,
2235,THE SILENT TIDE,"Waiting for the night,"
2236,THE SILENT TIDE,"Reuben made ready, lifted latch, went forth;"
2237,THE SILENT TIDE,"Then, with his little bundle in his hand,"
2238,THE SILENT TIDE,Took the bleak road that led him to the world.
2239,THE SILENT TIDE,"When Jerry eighteen years had sailed, had bared"
2240,THE SILENT TIDE,His hurt soul to the pitiless sun and drunk
2241,THE SILENT TIDE,"The rainy brew of storms on all seas, tired"
2242,THE SILENT TIDE,Of wreck and fever and renewed mischance
2243,THE SILENT TIDE,"That would not end in death, a longing stirred"
2244,THE SILENT TIDE,Within him to revisit that gray coast
2245,THE SILENT TIDE,Where he was born. He landed at the port
2246,THE SILENT TIDE,"Whence first he sailed; and, as in fervid youth,"
2247,THE SILENT TIDE,"Set forth upon the highway, to walk home."
2248,THE SILENT TIDE,"Some hoarding he had made, wherewith to enrich"
2249,THE SILENT TIDE,His brother's brood for spendthrift purposes;
2250,THE SILENT TIDE,"And as he walked he wondered how they looked,"
2251,THE SILENT TIDE,"How tall they were, how many there might be."
2252,THE SILENT TIDE,"At noon he set himself beside the way,"
2253,THE SILENT TIDE,Under a clump of willows sprouting dense
2254,THE SILENT TIDE,O'er the weed-woven margin of a brook;
2255,THE SILENT TIDE,While in the fine green branches overhead
2256,THE SILENT TIDE,"Song-sparrows lightly perched, for whom he threw"
2257,THE SILENT TIDE,"From his scant bread some crumbs, remembering well"
2258,THE SILENT TIDE,Old days when he had played with birds like these--
2259,THE SILENT TIDE,"The same, perhaps, or grandfathers of theirs,"
2260,THE SILENT TIDE,Or earlier still progenitors: whereat
2261,THE SILENT TIDE,They chirped and chattered louder than before.
2262,THE SILENT TIDE,"But, as he sat, a boy came down the road,"
2263,THE SILENT TIDE,Stirring the noontide dust with laggard feet.
2264,THE SILENT TIDE,"Young Reuben 't was, who seaward made his way."
2265,THE SILENT TIDE,"And Jerry hailed him, carelessly, his mood"
2266,THE SILENT TIDE,"Moving to salutation, and the boy,"
2267,THE SILENT TIDE,"From under his torn hat-brim looking, answered."
2268,THE SILENT TIDE,"Then, seeing that he eyed his scrap of bread,"
2269,THE SILENT TIDE,The sailor bade him come and share it. So
2270,THE SILENT TIDE,"They fell to talk; and Jerry, with a rough,"
2271,THE SILENT TIDE,"Quick-touching kindness, the boy's heart so moved"
2272,THE SILENT TIDE,That unto him he all his wrong confessed.
2273,THE SILENT TIDE,"Gravely the sailor looked at him, and told"
2274,THE SILENT TIDE,"His own tale of mad flight and wandering; how,"
2275,THE SILENT TIDE,"Wasted he had come back, his life a husk"
2276,THE SILENT TIDE,"Of withered seeds, a raveled purse, though once"
2277,THE SILENT TIDE,"With golden years well stocked, all squandered now."
2278,THE SILENT TIDE,"At ending, he prevailed, and Reub was won"
2279,THE SILENT TIDE,"To turn and follow. Jerry, though he knew"
2280,THE SILENT TIDE,"Not yet the father's name, said he that way"
2281,THE SILENT TIDE,"Was going, too, and he would intercede"
2282,THE SILENT TIDE,Between the truant and his father. Back
2283,THE SILENT TIDE,"Together then they went. But on the way,"
2284,THE SILENT TIDE,"As now they passed from pines to farming-land,"
2285,THE SILENT TIDE,"The boy asked more. ""'T is queer you should have come"
2286,THE SILENT TIDE,"From these same parts, and run away like me!"
2287,THE SILENT TIDE,"You did not tell me how it happened."""
2288,THE SILENT TIDE,
2289,THE SILENT TIDE,
2290,JERRY.,JERRY.
2291,JERRY.,
2292,JERRY.,"Foolish,"
2293,JERRY.,All of it! But I thought it weightier
2294,JERRY.,"Than the world's history, once. I could not stay"
2295,JERRY.,And see my brother married to the girl
2296,JERRY.,I loved; and so I went.
2297,JERRY.,
2298,JERRY.,
2299,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2300,THE BOY.,
2301,THE BOY.,I had an uncle
2302,THE BOY.,That was in love. But he--he drowned himself.
2303,THE BOY.,Why do men do so?
2304,THE BOY.,
2305,THE BOY.,
2306,JERRY.,JERRY.
2307,JERRY.,
2308,JERRY.,Drowned himself? And when?
2309,JERRY.,
2310,JERRY.,
2311,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2312,THE BOY.,
2313,THE BOY.,I don't know. Long ago; it's like a dream
2314,THE BOY.,To me. I was not born then. Deacon Snow
2315,THE BOY.,Has told me something of it. Mother cries
2316,THE BOY.,"Even now, beside his grave. Poor uncle!"
2317,THE BOY.,
2318,THE BOY.,
2319,JERRY.,JERRY.
2320,JERRY.,
2321,JERRY.,His grave!
2322,JERRY.,"(_That_ could not be, then.) Yet if it should be,"
2323,JERRY.,How can I think Grace cried--
2324,JERRY.,
2325,JERRY.,
2326,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2327,THE BOY.,
2328,THE BOY.,How did you know
2329,THE BOY.,My mother's name was Grace?
2330,THE BOY.,
2331,THE BOY.,
2332,JERRY.,JERRY.
2333,JERRY.,
2334,JERRY.,I am confused
2335,JERRY.,By what you say. But is your mother's name
2336,JERRY.,"Grace? How! Grace, too?"
2337,JERRY.,
2338,JERRY.,A strange uneasiness
2339,JERRY.,In Jerry's breast had waked. They walked awhile
2340,JERRY.,"In silence. This he could not well believe,"
2341,JERRY.,"That Grace and Reuben unhappy were, nor that"
2342,JERRY.,One son alone was theirs. Therefore aside
2343,JERRY.,"He thrust that hidden, sharp foreboding: still"
2344,JERRY.,"He trusted, still sustained a calm suspense,"
2345,JERRY.,"And ranged among his memories. ""Tell me, son,"""
2346,JERRY.,"He said, ""about this Deacon Snow--Rob Snow"
2347,JERRY.,"It must be, I suppose."""
2348,JERRY.,
2349,JERRY.,
2350,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2351,THE BOY.,
2352,THE BOY.,"Oh, do you know him?"
2353,THE BOY.,
2354,THE BOY.,
2355,JERRY.,JERRY.
2356,JERRY.,
2357,JERRY.,"A deacon now! Ay, once I knew Rob Snow--"
2358,JERRY.,"A jolly blade, if ever any was,"
2359,JERRY.,And merry as the full moon.
2360,JERRY.,
2361,JERRY.,
2362,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2363,THE BOY.,
2364,THE BOY.,He has failed
2365,THE BOY.,"A good deal now, though, since his wife died."
2366,THE BOY.,
2367,THE BOY.,
2368,JERRY.,JERRY.
2369,JERRY.,
2370,JERRY.,What!
2371,JERRY.,(Of course; of course; all's changed.) He married!
2372,JERRY.,
2373,JERRY.,
2374,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2375,THE BOY.,
2376,THE BOY.,"Why,"
2377,THE BOY.,How long you must have been away! For since
2378,THE BOY.,I can remember he has had a wife
2379,THE BOY.,And children. She was Gran'ther Hungerford's--
2380,THE BOY.,
2381,THE BOY.,
2382,JERRY.,JERRY.
2383,JERRY.,
2384,JERRY.,Her name was Ruth?
2385,JERRY.,
2386,JERRY.,
2387,THE BOY.,THE BOY.
2388,THE BOY.,
2389,THE BOY.,"Yes, Ruth! 'T is after her"
2390,THE BOY.,The deacon's nicest daughter's named; _she's_ Ruth.
2391,THE BOY.,
2392,THE BOY.,"Then sadly Jerry pondered, and no more"
2393,THE BOY.,Found speech. They tramped on sternly. To the brow
2394,THE BOY.,"Of a long hill they came, whence they could see"
2395,THE BOY.,The village and blue ocean; then they sank
2396,THE BOY.,Into a region of low-lying fields
2397,THE BOY.,"Half-naked from the scythe, and others veined"
2398,THE BOY.,"With vines that 'midst dismantled, fallen corn"
2399,THE BOY.,"Dragged all athwart a weight of tawny gourds,"
2400,THE BOY.,"Sun-mellowed, sound. And now the level way"
2401,THE BOY.,"Stretched forward eagerly, for hard ahead"
2402,THE BOY.,It made the turn that rounded Reuben's house.
2403,THE BOY.,Between the still road and the tossing sea
2404,THE BOY.,"Lay the wide swamp, with all its hundred pools"
2405,THE BOY.,Reflecting leaden light; anon they passed
2406,THE BOY.,A farm-yard where the noisy chanticleer
2407,THE BOY.,"Strutted and ruled, as one long since had done;"
2408,THE BOY.,And then the wayside trough with jutting spout
2409,THE BOY.,"Of ancient, mossy wood, that still poured forth"
2410,THE BOY.,Its liquid largess to all comers. Soon
2411,THE BOY.,"A slow cart met them, filled with gathered kelp:"
2412,THE BOY.,The salt scent seemed a breath of younger days.
2413,THE BOY.,"They reached the road-bend, and the evening shone"
2414,THE BOY.,"Upon them, calmly. Jerry paused, o'erwhelmed."
2415,THE BOY.,"Reuben, surprised, glanced at him, and then said,"
2416,THE BOY.,"""Yonder's the house."" Old Jerry gazed on him,"
2417,THE BOY.,And trembled; for before him slowly grew
2418,THE BOY.,Through the boy's face the mingled features there
2419,THE BOY.,"Of father and of mother--Grace's mouth,"
2420,THE BOY.,"Ripe, pouting lips, and Reuben's square-framed eyes."
2421,THE BOY.,"But, mastering well his voice, he bade the boy"
2422,THE BOY.,"Wait by the wall, till he a little while"
2423,THE BOY.,"Went forward, and prepared. So Reuben stayed;"
2424,THE BOY.,"And Jerry with uncertain step advanced,"
2425,THE BOY.,As dreaming of his youth and this his home.
2426,THE BOY.,Slowly he passed between the gateless posts
2427,THE BOY.,"Before the unused front door, slowly too"
2428,THE BOY.,Beyond the side porch with its woodbine thick
2429,THE BOY.,Draping autumnal splendor. Thus he came
2430,THE BOY.,"Before the kitchen window, where he saw"
2431,THE BOY.,A gray-haired woman bent o'er needle-work
2432,THE BOY.,"In gathering twilight. And without a voice,"
2433,THE BOY.,"Rooted, he stood. He stirred not, but his glance"
2434,THE BOY.,"Burned through the pane; uneasily she turned,"
2435,THE BOY.,And seeing that shaggy stranger standing there
2436,THE BOY.,"Expectant, shook her head, as though to warn"
2437,THE BOY.,"Some chance, wayfaring beggar. He, though, stood"
2438,THE BOY.,"And looked at her immovably. Then, quick"
2439,THE BOY.,"The sash upthrowing, she made as if to speak"
2440,THE BOY.,Harshly; but still he held his quiet eyes
2441,THE BOY.,Upon her. Now she paused; her throat throbbed full;
2442,THE BOY.,"Her lips paled suddenly, her wan face flamed,"
2443,THE BOY.,A fertile stir of memory strove to work
2444,THE BOY.,Renewal in those features wintry cold.
2445,THE BOY.,"And so she hung, while Jerry by a step"
2446,THE BOY.,"Drawn nearer, coming just beneath her, said,"
2447,THE BOY.,"""Grace!"" And she murmured, ""Jerry!"" Then she bent"
2448,THE BOY.,"Over him, clasping his great matted head"
2449,THE BOY.,"With those worn arms, all joyless; and the tears"
2450,THE BOY.,Fell hot upon his forehead from her eyes.
2451,THE BOY.,For now in this dim gloaming their two souls
2452,THE BOY.,"Unfruited, by an instant insight wild,"
2453,THE BOY.,"Delicious, found the full, mysterious clew"
2454,THE BOY.,"Of individual being, each in each."
2455,THE BOY.,"But, tremulously, soon they drew themselves"
2456,THE BOY.,"Away from that so sweet, so sad embrace,"
2457,THE BOY.,"The first, the last that could be theirs. Then he,"
2458,THE BOY.,"Summing his story in a word, a glance,"
2459,THE BOY.,"Added, ""But though you see me broken down"
2460,THE BOY.,"And poor enough, not empty-handed quite"
2461,THE BOY.,"I come. For God set in my way a gift,"
2462,THE BOY.,The best I could have sought. I bring it you
2463,THE BOY.,In memory of the love I bore. Not now
2464,THE BOY.,Must that again be thought of! Waste and black
2465,THE BOY.,"My life's fields lie behind me, and a frost"
2466,THE BOY.,"Has stilled the music of my hopes, but here"
2467,THE BOY.,"If I may dwell, nor trouble you, such a joy"
2468,THE BOY.,"Were mine, I dare not ask it. Oh forgive"
2469,THE BOY.,"The weakness! Come and see my gift!"""
2470,THE BOY.,
2471,THE BOY.,"Ah, tears"
2472,THE BOY.,"Flowed fast, that night, from springs of love unsealed"
2473,THE BOY.,Once more within the ancient house--rare tears
2474,THE BOY.,"Of reconciliation, grief, and joy!"
2475,THE BOY.,"A miracle, it seemed, had here been wrought,"
2476,THE BOY.,The dead brought back to life. And with him came
2477,THE BOY.,"The prodigal, repenting."
2478,THE BOY.,
2479,THE BOY.,"So, thenceforth,"
2480,THE BOY.,A spirit of peace within the household dwelt.
2481,THE BOY.,"In Jerry a swift-sent age these years had brought,"
2482,THE BOY.,"To soften him, wrought with all the woe at home"
2483,THE BOY.,"Such open, gracious dignity, that all"
2484,THE BOY.,For cheer and guidance learned to look to him.
2485,THE BOY.,"But chiefly th' younger Reuben sought his aid,"
2486,THE BOY.,And he with homely wisdom shaped the lad
2487,THE BOY.,"To a life's loving duty. Yet not long,"
2488,THE BOY.,Alas! the kind sea-farer with them stayed.
2489,THE BOY.,After some years his storm-racked body drooped.
2490,THE BOY.,The season came when crickets cease to sing
2491,THE BOY.,And flame-curled leaves fly fast; and Jerry sank
2492,THE BOY.,"Softly toward death. Then, on a boisterous morn"
2493,THE BOY.,That beat the wrecked woods with incessant gusts
2494,THE BOY.,"To wrest some last leaf from them, he arose"
2495,THE BOY.,And passed away. But those who loved him watched
2496,THE BOY.,"His fading, half in doubt, and half afraid,"
2497,THE BOY.,As if he must return again; for now
2498,THE BOY.,"Entering the past he seemed, and not a life"
2499,THE BOY.,Beyond; and some who thought of that old grave
2500,THE BOY.,"In the orchard, dreamed a breath's space that the man"
2501,THE BOY.,"Long buried had come back, and could not die."
2502,THE BOY.,"But so he died, and, ceasing, made request"
2503,THE BOY.,Beside that outcast of the deep to lie.
2504,THE BOY.,None other mark desired he but the stone
2505,THE BOY.,"Set there long since, though at a stranger's grave,"
2506,THE BOY.,In heavy memory of him thought dead.
2507,THE BOY.,
2508,THE BOY.,They marked the earth with one more mound beside
2509,THE BOY.,"The other, near a gap in the low wall"
2510,THE BOY.,That looked out seaward. There you ever hear
2511,THE BOY.,"The deep, remorseful requiem of the sea;"
2512,THE BOY.,"And there, in autumn, windfalls, showering thick"
2513,THE BOY.,"Upon the grave, score the slow, voiceless hours"
2514,THE BOY.,With unrebounding stroke. All round about
2515,THE BOY.,"Green milkweed rankly thrives, and golden-rod"
2516,THE BOY.,Sprouts from his prostrate heart in fine-poised grace
2517,THE BOY.,"Of haughty curve, with every crest in flower."
