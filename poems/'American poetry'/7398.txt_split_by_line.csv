53,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX"
54,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
55,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","""WHO gave this cup?"" The secret thou wouldst steal"
56,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Its brimming flood forbids it to reveal:
57,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",No mortal's eye shall read it till he first
58,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Cool the red throat of thirst.
59,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
60,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","If on the golden floor one draught remain,"
61,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Trust me, thy careful search will be in vain;"
62,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Not till the bowl is emptied shalt thou know
63,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",The names enrolled below.
64,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
65,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Deeper than Truth lies buried in her well
66,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Those modest names the graven letters spell
67,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Hide from the sight; but wait, and thou shalt see"
68,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Who the good angels be.
69,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
70,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Whose bounty glistens in the beauteous gift
71,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",That friendly hands to loving lips shall lift
72,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Turn the fair goblet when its floor is dry,--"
73,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Their names shall meet thine eye.
74,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
75,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Count thou their number on the beads of Heaven
76,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Alas! the clustered Pleiads are but seven;
77,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Nay, the nine sister Muses are too few,--"
78,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",The Graces must add two.
79,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
80,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","""For whom this gift?"" For one who all too long"
81,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Clings to his bough among the groves of song;
82,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Autumn's last leaf, that spreads its faded wing"
83,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",To greet a second spring.
84,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
85,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Dear friends, kind friends, whate'er the cup may hold,"
86,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Bathing its burnished depths, will change to gold"
87,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Its last bright drop let thirsty Maenads drain,"
88,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Its fragrance will remain.
89,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",
90,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Better love's perfume in the empty bowl
91,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",Than wine's nepenthe for the aching soul;
92,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX","Sweeter than song that ever poet sung,"
93,"ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF AUGUST, M DCCC LXXXIX",It makes an old heart young!

121,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,If every leaf on every shrub and tree
122,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,Turned to a sheet of foolscap; every sea
123,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"Were changed to ink, and all earth's living tribes"
124,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"Had nothing else to do but act as scribes,"
125,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"And for ten thousand ages, day and night,"
126,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"The human race should write, and write, and write,"
127,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"Till all the pens and paper were used up,"
128,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"And the huge inkstand was an empty cup,"
129,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,Still would the scribblers clustered round its brink
130,CACOETHES SCRIBENDI,"Call for more pens, more paper, and more ink."

136,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,
137,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"LADY, life's sweetest lesson wouldst thou learn,"
138,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,Come thou with me to Love's enchanted bower
139,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,High overhead the trellised roses burn;
140,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"Beneath thy feet behold the feathery fern,--"
141,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,A leaf without a flower.
142,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,
143,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"What though the rose leaves fall? They still are sweet,"
144,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"And have been lovely in their beauteous prime,"
145,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"While the bare frond seems ever to repeat,"
146,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"""For us no bud, no blossom, wakes to greet"
147,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"The joyous flowering time!"""
148,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,
149,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,Heed thou the lesson. Life has leaves to tread
150,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,And flowers to cherish; summer round thee glows;
151,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,"Wait not till autumn's fading robes are shed,"
152,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,But while its petals still are burning red
153,THE ROSE AND THE FERN,Gather life's full-blown rose!

160,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"I LIKE YOU Met I LOVE You, face to face;"
161,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"The path was narrow, and they could not pass."
162,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"I LIKE YOU smiled; I LOVE YOU cried, Alas!"
163,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,And so they halted for a little space.
164,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,
165,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"""Turn thou and go before,"" I LOVE YOU said,"
166,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"""Down the green pathway, bright with many a flower;"
167,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"Deep in the valley, lo! my bridal bower"
168,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"Awaits thee."" But I LIKE YOU shook his head."
169,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,
170,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,Then while they lingered on the span-wide shelf
171,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"That shaped a pathway round the rocky ledge,"
172,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"I LIKE You bared his icy dagger's edge,"
173,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,"And first he slew I LOVE You,--then himself."
174,I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU,

181,(BAR HARBOR),
182,(BAR HARBOR),FROM this fair home behold on either side
183,(BAR HARBOR),The restful mountains or the restless sea
184,(BAR HARBOR),So the warm sheltering walls of life divide
185,(BAR HARBOR),Time and its tides from still eternity.
186,(BAR HARBOR),
187,(BAR HARBOR),Look on the waves: their stormy voices teach
188,(BAR HARBOR),That not on earth may toil and struggle cease.
189,(BAR HARBOR),Look on the mountains: better far than speech
190,(BAR HARBOR),Their silent promise of eternal peace.

223,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
224,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"LOOK out! Look out, boys! Clear the track!"
225,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The witches are here! They've all come back!
226,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They hanged them high,--No use! No use!"
227,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,What cares a witch for a hangman's noose?
228,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They buried them deep, but they wouldn't lie still,"
229,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,For cats and witches are hard to kill;
230,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They swore they shouldn't and wouldn't die,--"
231,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Books said they did, but they lie! they lie!"
232,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
233,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"A couple of hundred years, or so,"
234,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They had knocked about in the world below,"
235,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"When an Essex Deacon dropped in to call,"
236,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And a homesick feeling seized them all;
237,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"For he came from a place they knew full well,"
238,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And many a tale he had to tell.
239,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They longed to visit the haunts of men,"
240,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"To see the old dwellings they knew again,"
241,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And ride on their broomsticks all around
242,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Their wide domain of unhallowed ground.
243,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
244,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,In Essex county there's many a roof
245,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Well known to him of the cloven hoof;
246,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The small square windows are full in view
247,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Which the midnight hags went sailing through,"
248,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"On their well-trained broomsticks mounted high,"
249,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Seen like shadows against the sky;
250,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Crossing the track of owls and bats,"
251,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Hugging before them their coal-black cats.
252,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
253,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Well did they know, those gray old wives,"
254,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The sights we see in our daily drives
255,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Shimmer of lake and shine of sea,"
256,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Browne's bare hill with its lonely tree,"
257,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"(It was n't then as we see it now,"
258,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,With one scant scalp-lock to shade its brow;)
259,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Dusky nooks in the Essex woods,"
260,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Dark, dim, Dante-like solitudes,"
261,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Where the tree-toad watches the sinuous snake
262,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Glide through his forests of fern and brake;
263,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Ipswich River; its old stone bridge;
264,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Far off Andover's Indian Ridge,"
265,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And many a scene where history tells
266,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Some shadow of bygone terror dwells,--"
267,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Of ""Norman's Woe"" with its tale of dread,"
268,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Of the Screeching Woman of Marblehead,"
269,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,(The fearful story that turns men pale
270,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Don't bid me tell it,--my speech would fail.)"
271,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
272,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Who would not, will not, if he can,"
273,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Bathe in the breezes of fair Cape Ann,--"
274,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Rest in the bowers her bays enfold,"
275,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Loved by the sachems and squaws of old?
276,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Home where the white magnolias bloom,"
277,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Sweet with the bayberry's chaste perfume,"
278,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Hugged by the woods and kissed by the sea!
279,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Where is the Eden like to thee?
280,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"For that ""couple of hundred years, or so,"""
281,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,There had been no peace in the world below;
282,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"The witches still grumbling, ""It is n't fair;"
283,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Come, give us a taste of the upper air!"
284,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"We 've had enough of your sulphur springs,"
285,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And the evil odor that round them clings;
286,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"We long for a drink that is cool and nice,--"
287,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Great buckets of water with Wenham ice;
288,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"We've served you well up-stairs, you know;"
289,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"You 're a good old--fellow--come, let us go!"""
290,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
291,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"I don't feel sure of his being good,"
292,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"But he happened to be in a pleasant mood,--"
293,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"As fiends with their skins full sometimes are,--"
294,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"(He'd been drinking with ""roughs"" at a Boston bar.)"
295,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,So what does he do but up and shout
296,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"To a graybeard turnkey, ""Let 'em out!"""
297,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
298,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,To mind his orders was all he knew;
299,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"The gates swung open, and out they flew."
300,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""Where are our broomsticks?"" the beldams cried."
301,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""Here are your broomsticks,"" an imp replied."
302,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""They 've been in--the place you know--so long"
303,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,They smell of brimstone uncommon strong;
304,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"But they've gained by being left alone,--"
305,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Just look, and you'll see how tall they've grown."""
306,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""And where is my cat?"" a vixen squalled."
307,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""Yes, where are our cats?"" the witches bawled,"
308,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And began to call them all by name
309,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"As fast as they called the cats, they came"
310,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"There was bob-tailed Tommy and long-tailed Tim,"
311,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And wall-eyed Jacky and green-eyed Jim,"
312,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And splay-foot Benny and slim-legged Beau,"
313,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And Skinny and Squally, and Jerry and Joe,"
314,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And many another that came at call,--"
315,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,It would take too long to count them all.
316,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"All black,--one could hardly tell which was which,"
317,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,But every cat knew his own old witch;
318,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And she knew hers as hers knew her,--"
319,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Ah, didn't they curl their tails and purr!"
320,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
321,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,No sooner the withered hags were free
322,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Than out they swarmed for a midnight spree;
323,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"I couldn't tell all they did in rhymes,"
324,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,But the Essex people had dreadful times.
325,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The Swampscott fishermen still relate
326,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,How a strange sea-monster stole their bait;
327,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"How their nets were tangled in loops and knots,"
328,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And they found dead crabs in their lobster-pots.
329,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Poor Danvers grieved for her blasted crops,"
330,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And Wilmington mourned over mildewed hops.
331,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"A blight played havoc with Beverly beans,--"
332,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,It was all the work of those hateful queans!
333,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"A dreadful panic began at ""Pride's,"""
334,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Where the witches stopped in their midnight rides,"
335,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And there rose strange rumors and vague alarms
336,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,'Mid the peaceful dwellers at Beverly Farms.
337,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
338,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Now when the Boss of the Beldams found
339,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"That without his leave they were ramping round,"
340,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"He called,--they could hear him twenty miles,"
341,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,From Chelsea beach to the Misery Isles;
342,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The deafest old granny knew his tone
343,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Without the trick of the telephone.
344,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""Come here, you witches! Come here!"" says he,--"
345,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""At your games of old, without asking me!"
346,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,I'll give you a little job to do
347,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"That will keep you stirring, you godless crew!"""
348,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
349,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"They came, of course, at their master's call,"
350,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"The witches, the broomsticks, the cats, and all;"
351,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,He led the hags to a railway train
352,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The horses were trying to drag in vain.
353,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"""Now, then,"" says he, ""you've had your fun,"
354,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And here are the cars you've got to run.
355,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"The driver may just unhitch his team,"
356,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"We don't want horses, we don't want steam;"
357,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"You may keep your old black cats to hug,"
358,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"But the loaded train you've got to lug."""
359,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
360,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Since then on many a car you 'll see
361,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,A broomstick plain as plain can be;
362,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"On every stick there's a witch astride,--"
363,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,The string you see to her leg is tied.
364,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"She will do a mischief if she can,"
365,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"But the string is held by a careful man,"
366,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,And whenever the evil-minded witch

368,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"As for the hag, you can't see her,"
369,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"But hark! you can hear her black cat's purr,"
370,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"And now and then, as a car goes by,"
371,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,You may catch a gleam from her wicked eye.
372,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
373,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"Often you've looked on a rushing train,"
374,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,But just what moved it was not so plain.
375,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"It couldn't be those wires above,"
376,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,For they could neither pull nor shove;
377,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Where was the motor that made it go
378,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,"You couldn't guess, but now you know."
379,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,
380,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,Remember my rhymes when you ride again
381,THE RETURN OF THE WITCHES,On the rattling rail by the broomstick train!

388,TARTARUS,WHILE in my simple gospel creed
389,TARTARUS,"That ""God is Love"" so plain I read,"
390,TARTARUS,Shall dreams of heathen birth affright
391,TARTARUS,My pathway through the coming night?
392,TARTARUS,"Ah, Lord of life, though spectres pale"
393,TARTARUS,"Fill with their threats the shadowy vale,"
394,TARTARUS,"With Thee my faltering steps to aid,"
395,TARTARUS,How can I dare to be afraid?
396,TARTARUS,
397,TARTARUS,Shall mouldering page or fading scroll
398,TARTARUS,Outface the charter of the soul?
399,TARTARUS,Shall priesthood's palsied arm protect
400,TARTARUS,"The wrong our human hearts reject,"
401,TARTARUS,And smite the lips whose shuddering cry
402,TARTARUS,Proclaims a cruel creed a lie?
403,TARTARUS,The wizard's rope we disallow
404,TARTARUS,"Was justice once,--is murder now!"
405,TARTARUS,
406,TARTARUS,"Is there a world of blank despair,"
407,TARTARUS,And dwells the Omnipresent there?
408,TARTARUS,Does He behold with smile serene
409,TARTARUS,"The shows of that unending scene,"
410,TARTARUS,"Where sleepless, hopeless anguish lies,"
411,TARTARUS,"And, ever dying, never dies?"
412,TARTARUS,"Say, does He hear the sufferer's groan,"
413,TARTARUS,And is that child of wrath his own?
414,TARTARUS,
415,TARTARUS,"O mortal, wavering in thy trust,"
416,TARTARUS,Lift thy pale forehead from the dust!
417,TARTARUS,The mists that cloud thy darkened eyes
418,TARTARUS,Fade ere they reach the o'erarching skies
419,TARTARUS,When the blind heralds of despair
420,TARTARUS,"Would bid thee doubt a Father's care,"
421,TARTARUS,"Look up from earth, and read above"
422,TARTARUS,"On heaven's blue tablet, GOD IS LOVE!"

437,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"For my love is its sunshine,--she meets me to-day!"
438,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,

443,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
444,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Do I see her afar in the distance? Not yet.
445,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Too early! Too early! She could not forget!
446,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"When I cross the old bridge where the brook overflowed,"
447,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,She will flash full in sight at the turn of the road.
448,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
449,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I pass the low wall where the ivy entwines;
450,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I tread the brown pathway that leads through the pines;
451,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"I haste by the boulder that lies in the field,"
452,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Where her promise at parting was lovingly sealed.
453,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
454,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Will she come by the hillside or round through the wood?
455,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Will she wear her brown dress or her mantle and hood?
456,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"The minute draws near,--but her watch may go wrong;"
457,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"My heart will be asking, What keeps her so long?"
458,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
459,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Why doubt for a moment? More shame if I do!
460,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Why question? Why tremble? Are angels more true?
461,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,She would come to the lover who calls her his own
462,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Though she trod in the track of a whirling cyclone!
463,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
464,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I crossed the old bridge ere the minute had passed.
465,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I looked: lo! my Love stood before me at last.
466,AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Her eyes, how they sparkled, her cheeks, how they glowed,"

511,TO MY OLD READERS,Which round the Teapot you have often met;
512,TO MY OLD READERS,"The grave DICTATOR, him you knew of old,--"
513,TO MY OLD READERS,Knew as the shepherd of another fold
514,TO MY OLD READERS,"Grayer he looks, less youthful, but the same"
515,TO MY OLD READERS,As when you called him by a different name.
516,TO MY OLD READERS,"Near him the MISTRESS, whose experienced skill"
517,TO MY OLD READERS,Has taught her duly every cup to fill;

521,TO MY OLD READERS,"At every turn the teacher's tongue betrays,"
522,TO MY OLD READERS,Trying so hard to make his speech precise
523,TO MY OLD READERS,The captious listener finds it overnice.
524,TO MY OLD READERS,
525,TO MY OLD READERS,"Nor be forgotten our ANNEXES twain,"
526,TO MY OLD READERS,"Nor HE, the owner of the squinting brain,"
527,TO MY OLD READERS,"Which, while its curious fancies we pursue,"
528,TO MY OLD READERS,"Oft makes us question, ""Are we crack-brained too?"""
529,TO MY OLD READERS,
530,TO MY OLD READERS,"Along the board our growing list extends,"
531,TO MY OLD READERS,"As one by one we count our clustering friends,--"
532,TO MY OLD READERS,The youthful DOCTOR waiting for his share
533,TO MY OLD READERS,Of fits and fevers when his crown gets bare;
534,TO MY OLD READERS,"In strong, dark lines our square-nibbed pen should draw"
535,TO MY OLD READERS,The lordly presence of the MAN OF LAW;
536,TO MY OLD READERS,"Our bashful TUTOR claims a humbler place,"
537,TO MY OLD READERS,"A lighter touch, his slender form to trace."
538,TO MY OLD READERS,"Mark the fair lady he is seated by,--"

544,TO MY OLD READERS,"Such task demands a readier pen than mine,--"

546,TO MY OLD READERS,
547,TO MY OLD READERS,"Why should I call her gracious, winning, fair?"
548,TO MY OLD READERS,Why with the loveliest of her sex compare?
549,TO MY OLD READERS,"Those varied charms have many a Muse inspired,--"
550,TO MY OLD READERS,At last their worn superlatives have tired;
551,TO MY OLD READERS,"Wit, beauty, sweetness, each alluring grace,"
552,TO MY OLD READERS,All these in honeyed verse have found their place;
553,TO MY OLD READERS,"I need them not,--two little words I find"

560,TO MY OLD READERS,"Add all together, you will find them ten,--"
561,TO MY OLD READERS,Our young MUSICIAN joined us now and then.
562,TO MY OLD READERS,"Our bright DELILAH you must needs recall,"
563,TO MY OLD READERS,"The comely handmaid, youngest of us all;"
564,TO MY OLD READERS,Need I remind you how the little maid
565,TO MY OLD READERS,"Came at a pinch to our Professor's aid,--"
566,TO MY OLD READERS,Trimmed his long locks with unrelenting shears
567,TO MY OLD READERS,And eased his looks of half a score of years?

569,TO MY OLD READERS,"Sometimes, at table, as you well must know,"
570,TO MY OLD READERS,"The stream of talk will all at once run low,"
571,TO MY OLD READERS,"The air seems smitten with a sudden chill,"
572,TO MY OLD READERS,The wit grows silent and the gossip still;
573,TO MY OLD READERS,"This was our poet's chance, the hour of need,"
574,TO MY OLD READERS,When rhymes and stories we were used to read.
575,TO MY OLD READERS,"One day a whisper round the teacups stole,--"
576,TO MY OLD READERS,"""No scrap of paper in the silver bowl!"""
577,TO MY OLD READERS,"(Our ""poet's corner"" may I not expect"

581,TO MY OLD READERS,"""No matter, something we must find to read,--"
582,TO MY OLD READERS,"Find it or make it,--yes, we must indeed!"
583,TO MY OLD READERS,Now I remember I have seen at times
584,TO MY OLD READERS,"Some curious stories in a book of rhymes,--"
585,TO MY OLD READERS,"How certain secrets, long in silence sealed,"
586,TO MY OLD READERS,In after days were guessed at or revealed.
587,TO MY OLD READERS,"Those stories, doubtless, some of you must know,--"
588,TO MY OLD READERS,They all were written many a year ago;
589,TO MY OLD READERS,"But an old story, be it false or true,"
590,TO MY OLD READERS,"Twice told, well told, is twice as good as new;"
591,TO MY OLD READERS,"Wait but three sips and I will go myself,"
592,TO MY OLD READERS,"And fetch the book of verses from its shelf."""
593,TO MY OLD READERS,"No time was lost in finding what she sought,--"
594,TO MY OLD READERS,"Gone but one moment,--lo! the book is brought."
595,TO MY OLD READERS,
596,TO MY OLD READERS,"""Now, then, Professor, fortune has decreed"
597,TO MY OLD READERS,"That you, this evening, shall be first to read,--"
598,TO MY OLD READERS,"Lucky for us that listen, for in fact"
599,TO MY OLD READERS,"Who reads this poem must know how to _act_."""
600,TO MY OLD READERS,Right well she knew that in his greener age
601,TO MY OLD READERS,He had a mighty hankering for the stage.
602,TO MY OLD READERS,The patient audience had not long to wait;
603,TO MY OLD READERS,"Pleased with his chance, he smiled and took the bait;"
604,TO MY OLD READERS,"Through his wild hair his coaxing fingers ran,--"
605,TO MY OLD READERS,He spread the page before him and began.

612,THE BANKER'S SECRET,THE Banker's dinner is the stateliest feast
613,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The town has heard of for a year, at least;"
614,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sparry lustres shed their broadest blaze,"
615,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Damask and silver catch and spread the rays;
616,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The florist's triumphs crown the daintier spoil
617,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Won from the sea, the forest, or the soil;"
618,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The steaming hot-house yields its largest pines,"
619,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The sunless vaults unearth their oldest wines;
620,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"With one admiring look the scene survey,"
621,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And turn a moment from the bright display.
622,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
623,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Of all the joys of earthly pride or power,"
624,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"What gives most life, worth living, in an hour?"
625,THE BANKER'S SECRET,When Victory settles on the doubtful fight
626,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And the last foeman wheels in panting flight,"
627,THE BANKER'S SECRET,No thrill like this is felt beneath the sun;
628,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Life's sovereign moment is a battle won.
629,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But say what next? To shape a Senate's choice,"
630,THE BANKER'S SECRET,By the strong magic of the master's voice;
631,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To ride the stormy tempest of debate
632,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That whirls the wavering fortunes of the state.
633,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Third in the list, the happy lover's prize"
634,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is won by honeyed words from women's eyes.
635,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"If some would have it first instead of third,"
636,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So let it be,--I answer not a word."
637,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The fourth,--sweet readers, let the thoughtless half"
638,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Have its small shrug and inoffensive laugh;
639,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Let the grave quarter wear its virtuous frown,"
640,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The stern half-quarter try to scowl us down;
641,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But the last eighth, the choice and sifted few,"
642,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Will hear my words, and, pleased, confess them true."
643,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
644,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Among the great whom Heaven has made to shine,"
645,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"How few have learned the art of arts,--to dine!"
646,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Nature, indulgent to our daily need,"
647,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Kind-hearted mother! taught us all to feed;
648,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But the chief art,--how rarely Nature flings"
649,THE BANKER'S SECRET,This choicest gift among her social kings
650,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Say, man of truth, has life a brighter hour"
651,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Than waits the chosen guest who knows his power?
652,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He moves with ease, itself an angel charm,--"
653,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Lifts with light touch my lady's jewelled arm,"
654,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Slides to his seat, half leading and half led,"
655,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Smiling but quiet till the grace is said,"
656,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Then gently kindles, while by slow degrees"
657,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Creep softly out the little arts that please;
658,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bright looks, the cheerful language of the eye,"
659,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The neat, crisp question and the gay reply,--"
660,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Talk light and airy, such as well may pass"
661,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Between the rested fork and lifted glass;--
662,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"With play like this the earlier evening flies,"
663,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Till rustling silks proclaim the ladies rise.
664,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His hour has come,--he looks along the chairs,"
665,THE BANKER'S SECRET,As the Great Duke surveyed his iron squares.
666,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That's the young traveller,--is n't much to show,--"
667,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Fast on the road, but at the table slow."
668,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Next him,--you see the author in his look,--"
669,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His forehead lined with wrinkles like a book,--"
670,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Wrote the great history of the ancient Huns,--"
671,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Holds back to fire among the heavy guns.
672,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Oh, there's our poet seated at his side,"
673,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Beloved of ladies, soft, cerulean-eyed."
674,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Poets are prosy in their common talk,"
675,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"As the fast trotters, for the most part, walk."
676,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there's our well-dressed gentleman, who sits,"
677,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"By right divine, no doubt, among the wits,"
678,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Who airs his tailor's patterns when he walks,"
679,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The man that often speaks, but never talks."
680,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Why should he talk, whose presence lends a grace"
681,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To every table where he shows his face?
682,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He knows the manual of the silver fork,"
683,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Can name his claret--if he sees the cork,--"
684,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Remark that ""White-top"" was considered fine,"
685,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But swear the ""Juno"" is the better wine;--"
686,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is not this talking? Ask Quintilian's rules;
687,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"If they say No, the town has many fools."
688,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Pause for a moment,--for our eyes behold"
689,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The plain unsceptred king, the man of gold,"
690,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The thrice illustrious threefold millionnaire;
691,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Mark his slow-creeping, dead, metallic stare;"
692,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His eyes, dull glimmering, like the balance-pan"
693,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That weighs its guinea as he weighs his man.
694,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who's next? An artist in a satin tie
695,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Whose ample folds defeat the curious eye.
696,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there 's the cousin,--must be asked, you know,--"
697,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Looks like a spinster at a baby-show.
698,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hope he is cool,--they set him next the door,--"
699,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And likes his place, between the gap and bore."
700,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Next comes a Congressman, distinguished guest"
701,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We don't count him,--they asked him with the rest;"
702,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And then some white cravats, with well-shaped ties,"
703,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And heads above them which their owners prize.
704,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
705,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Of all that cluster round the genial board,"
706,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Not one so radiant as the banquet's lord.
707,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Some say they fancy, but they know not why,"
708,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A shade of trouble brooding in his eye,"
709,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Nothing, perhaps,--the rooms are overhot,--"
710,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Yet see his cheek,--the dull-red burning spot,--"
711,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Taste the brown sherry which he does not pass,--"
712,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Ha! That is brandy; see him fill his glass!
713,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"But not forgetful of his feasting friends,"
714,THE BANKER'S SECRET,To each in turn some lively word he sends;
715,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"See how he throws his baited lines about,"
716,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And plays his men as anglers play their trout.
717,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A question drops among the listening crew
718,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And hits the traveller, pat on Timbuctoo."
719,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We're on the Niger, somewhere near its source,--"
720,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Not the least hurry, take the river's course"
721,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Through Kissi, Foota, Kankan, Bammakoo,"
722,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bambarra, Sego, so to Timbuctoo,"
723,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Thence down to Youri;--stop him if we can,"
724,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"We can't fare worse,--wake up the Congressman!"
725,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The Congressman, once on his talking legs,"
726,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Stirs up his knowledge to its thickest dregs;
727,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Tremendous draught for dining men to quaff!
728,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Nothing will choke him but a purpling laugh.
729,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A word,--a shout,--a mighty roar,--'t is done;"
730,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Extinguished; lassoed by a treacherous pun.
731,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A laugh is priming to the loaded soul;
732,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The scattering shots become a steady roll,"
733,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Broke by sharp cracks that run along the line,"
734,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The light artillery of the talker's wine.
735,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The kindling goblets flame with golden dews,"
736,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The hoarded flasks their tawny fire diffuse,"
737,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And the Rhine's breast-milk gushes cold and bright,"
738,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Pale as the moon and maddening as her light;
739,THE BANKER'S SECRET,With crimson juice the thirsty southern sky
740,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Sucks from the hills where buried armies lie,"
741,THE BANKER'S SECRET,So that the dreamy passion it imparts
742,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Is drawn from heroes' bones and lovers' hearts.
743,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But lulls will come; the flashing soul transmits
744,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Its gleams of light in alternating fits.
745,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The shower of talk that rattled down amain
746,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Ends in small patterings like an April's rain;
747,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
748,THE BANKER'S SECRET,With the dry sticks all bonfires are begun;
749,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bring the first fagot, proser number one"
750,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The voices halt; the game is at a stand;
751,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Now for a solo from the master-hand
752,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"'T is but a story,--quite a simple thing,--"
753,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"An aria touched upon a single string,"
754,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But every accent comes with such a grace
755,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The stupid servants listen in their place,"
756,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Each with his waiter in his lifted hands,"
757,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Still as a well-bred pointer when he stands.
758,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A query checks him: ""Is he quite exact?"""
759,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"(This from a grizzled, square-jawed man of fact.)"
760,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sparkling story leaves him to his fate,"
761,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Crushed by a witness, smothered with a date,"
762,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"As a swift river, sown with many a star,"
763,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Runs brighter, rippling on a shallow bar."
764,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The smooth divine suggests a graver doubt;
765,THE BANKER'S SECRET,A neat quotation bowls the parson out;
766,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Then, sliding gayly from his own display,"
767,THE BANKER'S SECRET,He laughs the learned dulness all away.
768,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So, with the merry tale and jovial song,"
769,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The jocund evening whirls itself along,"
770,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Till the last chorus shrieks its loud encore,"
771,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And the white neckcloths vanish through the door.
772,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
773,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"One savage word!--The menials know its tone,"
774,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And slink away; the master stands alone.
775,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Well played, by ---""; breathe not what were best unheard;"
776,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"His goblet shivers while he speaks the word,--"
777,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""If wine tells truth,--and so have said the wise,--"
778,THE BANKER'S SECRET,It makes me laugh to think how brandy lies!
779,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bankrupt to-morrow,--millionnaire to-day,--"
780,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The farce is over,--now begins the play!"""
781,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The spring he touches lets a panel glide;
782,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"An iron closet harks beneath the slide,"
783,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bright with such treasures as a search might bring
784,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From the deep pockets of a truant king.
785,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Two diamonds, eyeballs of a god of bronze,"
786,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Bought from his faithful priest, a pious bonze;"
787,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A string of brilliants; rubies, three or four;"
788,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bags of old coin and bars of virgin ore;
789,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A jewelled poniard and a Turkish knife,"
790,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Noiseless and useful if we come to strife.
791,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Gone! As a pirate flies before the wind,"
792,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And not one tear for all he leaves behind
793,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From all the love his better years have known
794,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Fled like a felon,--ah! but not alone!"
795,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The chariot flashes through a lantern's glare,--"
796,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Oh the wild eyes! the storm of sable hair!
797,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Still to his side the broken heart will cling,--"
798,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The bride of shame, the wife without the ring"
799,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hark, the deep oath,--the wail of frenzied woe,--"
800,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Lost! lost to hope of Heaven and peace below!
801,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
802,THE BANKER'S SECRET,He kept his secret; but the seed of crime
803,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Bursts of itself in God's appointed time.
804,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide;
805,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"One never blamed nor wept,--she only died."
806,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"None knew his lot, though idle tongues would say"
807,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He sought a lonely refuge far away,"
808,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"And there, with borrowed name and altered mien,"
809,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He died unheeded, as he lived unseen."
810,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The moral market had the usual chills
811,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Of Virtue suffering from protested bills;
812,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The White Cravats, to friendship's memory true,"
813,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Sighed for the past, surveyed the future too;"
814,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Their sorrow breathed in one expressive line,--"
815,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Gave pleasant dinners; who has got his wine?"""

818,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
819,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The reader paused,--the Teacups knew his ways,--"
820,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He, like the rest, was not averse to praise."
821,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Voices and hands united; every one
822,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Joined in approval: ""Number Three, well done!"""
823,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
824,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Now for the Exile's story; if my wits"
825,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Are not at fault, his curious record fits"
826,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Neatly as sequel to the tale we've heard;
827,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Not wholly wild the fancy, nor absurd"
828,THE BANKER'S SECRET,That this our island hermit well might be
829,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That story's hero, fled from over sea."
830,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Come, Number Seven, we would not have you strain"
831,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The fertile powers of that inventive brain.
832,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Read us 'The Exile's Secret'; there's enough
833,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Of dream-like fiction and fantastic stuff

838,THE BANKER'S SECRET,No harm was known of that secluded man.
839,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He lived alone,--who would n't if he might,"
840,THE BANKER'S SECRET,And leave the rogues and idiots out of sight?
841,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"A foolish story,--still, I'll do my best,--"
842,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The house was real,--don't believe the rest."
843,THE BANKER'S SECRET,How could a ruined dwelling last so long
844,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Without its legends shaped in tale and song?
845,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who was this man of whom they tell the lies?
846,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Perhaps--why not?--NAPOLEON! in disguise,--"
847,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"So some said, kidnapped from his ocean coop,"
848,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Brought to this island in a coasting sloop,--"
849,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Meanwhile a sham Napoleon in his place
850,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Played Nap. and saved Sir Hudson from disgrace.
851,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Such was one story; others used to say,"
852,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""No,--not Napoleon,--it was Marshal Ney."""
853,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"""Shot?"" Yes, no doubt, but not with balls of lead,"
854,THE BANKER'S SECRET,But balls of pith that never shoot folks dead.
855,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"He wandered round, lived South for many a year,"
856,THE BANKER'S SECRET,At last came North and fixed his dwelling here.
857,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Choose which you will of all the tales that pile
858,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Their mingling fables on the tree-crowned isle.
859,THE BANKER'S SECRET,Who wrote this modest version I suppose
860,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"That truthful Teacup, our Dictator, knows;"
861,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Made up of various legends, it would seem,"
862,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"The sailor's yarn, the crazy poet's dream."
863,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Such tales as this, by simple souls received,"
864,THE BANKER'S SECRET,At first are stared at and at last believed;
865,THE BANKER'S SECRET,From threads like this the grave historians try
866,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"To weave their webs, and never know they lie."
867,THE BANKER'S SECRET,"Hear, then, the fables that have gathered round"
868,THE BANKER'S SECRET,The lonely home an exiled stranger found.
869,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
870,THE BANKER'S SECRET,
871,THE EXILE'S SECRET,THE EXILE'S SECRET
872,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
873,THE EXILE'S SECRET,YE that have faced the billows and the spray
874,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Of good St. Botolph's island-studded bay,"
875,THE EXILE'S SECRET,As from the gliding bark your eye has scanned
876,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The beaconed rocks, the wave-girt hills of sand,"
877,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Have ye not marked one elm-o'ershadowed isle,"
878,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Round as the dimple chased in beauty's smile,--"
879,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"A stain of verdure on an azure field,"
880,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Set like a jewel in a battered shield?
881,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Fixed in the narrow gorge of Ocean's path,"
882,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Peaceful it meets him in his hour of wrath;
883,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"When the mailed Titan, scourged by hissing gales,"
884,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Writhes in his glistening coat of clashing scales,"
885,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The storm-beat island spreads its tranquil green,"
886,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Calm as an emerald on an angry queen.
887,THE EXILE'S SECRET,So fair when distant should be fairer near;
888,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A boat shall waft us from the outstretched pier.
889,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The breeze blows fresh; we reach the island's edge,"
890,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Our shallop rustling through the yielding sedge.
891,THE EXILE'S SECRET,No welcome greets us on the desert isle;
892,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Those elms, far-shadowing, hide no stately pile"
893,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Yet these green ridges mark an ancient road;
894,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And to! the traces of a fair abode;
895,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The long gray line that marks a garden-wall,"
896,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And heaps of fallen beams,--fire-branded all."
897,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
898,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Who sees unmoved, a ruin at his feet,"
899,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The lowliest home where human hearts have beat?
900,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its hearthstone, shaded with the bistre stain"
901,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A century's showery torrents wash in vain;
902,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its starving orchard, where the thistle blows"
903,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And mossy trunks still mark the broken rows;
904,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its chimney-loving poplar, oftenest seen"
905,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Next an old roof, or where a roof has been;"
906,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its knot-grass, plantain,--all the social weeds,"
907,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Man's mute companions, following where he leads;"
908,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its dwarfed, pale flowers, that show their straggling heads,"
909,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Sown by the wind from grass-choked garden-beds;
910,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its woodbine, creeping where it used to climb;"
911,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Its roses, breathing of the olden time;"
912,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"All the poor shows the curious idler sees,"
913,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"As life's thin shadows waste by slow degrees,"
914,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Till naught remains, the saddening tale to tell,"
915,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Save home's last wrecks,--the cellar and the well?"
916,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
917,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And whose the home that strews in black decay
918,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The one green-glowing island of the bay?
919,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some dark-browed pirate's, jealous of the fate"
920,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"That seized the strangled wretch of ""Nix's Mate""?"
921,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some forger's, skulking in a borrowed name,"
922,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Whom Tyburn's dangling halter yet may claim?
923,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some wan-eyed exile's, wealth and sorrow's heir,"
924,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Who sought a lone retreat for tears and prayer?
925,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Some brooding poet's, sure of deathless fame,"
926,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Had not his epic perished in the flame?
927,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or some gray wooer's, whom a girlish frown"
928,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Chased from his solid friends and sober town?
929,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or some plain tradesman's, fond of shade and ease,"
930,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Who sought them both beneath these quiet trees?
931,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Why question mutes no question can unlock,"
932,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Dumb as the legend on the Dighton rock?
933,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"One thing at least these ruined heaps declare,--"
934,THE EXILE'S SECRET,They were a shelter once; a man lived there.
935,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
936,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But where the charred and crumbling records fail,"
937,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some breathing lips may piece the half-told tale;
938,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"No man may live with neighbors such as these,"
939,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Though girt with walls of rock and angry seas,"
940,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And shield his home, his children, or his wife,"
941,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His ways, his means, his vote, his creed, his life,"
942,THE EXILE'S SECRET,From the dread sovereignty of Ears and Eyes
943,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And the small member that beneath them lies.
944,THE EXILE'S SECRET,They told strange things of that mysterious man;
945,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Believe who will, deny them such as can;"
946,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Why should we fret if every passing sail
947,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Had its old seaman talking on the rail?
948,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The deep-sunk schooner stuffed with Eastern lime,"
949,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Slow wedging on, as if the waves were slime;"
950,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The knife-edged clipper with her ruffled spars,"
951,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The pawing steamer with her inane of stars,"
952,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The bull-browed galliot butting through the stream,"
953,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The wide-sailed yacht that slipped along her beam,"
954,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The deck-piled sloops, the pinched chebacco-boats,"
955,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The frigate, black with thunder-freighted throats,"
956,THE EXILE'S SECRET,All had their talk about the lonely man;
957,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And thus, in varying phrase, the story ran."
958,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His name had cost him little care to seek,"
959,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Plain, honest, brief, a decent name to speak,"
960,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Common, not vulgar, just the kind that slips"
961,THE EXILE'S SECRET,With least suggestion from a stranger's lips.
962,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His birthplace England, as his speech might show,"
963,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or his hale cheek, that wore the red-streak's glow;"
964,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His mouth sharp-moulded; in its mirth or scorn
965,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"There came a flash as from the milky corn,"
966,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"When from the ear you rip the rustling sheath,"
967,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And the white ridges show their even teeth.
968,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"His stature moderate, but his strength confessed,"
969,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"In spite of broadcloth, by his ample breast;"
970,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Full-armed, thick-handed; one that had been strong,"
971,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And might be dangerous still, if things went wrong."
972,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He lived at ease beneath his elm-trees' shade,"
973,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Did naught for gain, yet all his debts were paid;"
974,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Rich, so 't was thought, but careful of his store;"
975,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Had all he needed, claimed to have no more."
976,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
977,THE EXILE'S SECRET,But some that lingered round the isle at night
978,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Spoke of strange stealthy doings in their sight;
979,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of creeping lonely visits that he made
980,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"To nooks and corners, with a torch and spade."
981,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some said they saw the hollow of a cave;
982,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"One, given to fables, swore it was a grave;"
983,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Whereat some shuddered, others boldly cried,"
984,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Those prowling boatmen lied, and knew they lied."
985,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"They said his house was framed with curious cares,"
986,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Lest some old friend might enter unawares;
987,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That on the platform at his chamber's door
988,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Hinged a loose square that opened through the floor;
989,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Touch the black silken tassel next the bell,"
990,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Down, with a crash, the flapping trap-door fell;"
991,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Three stories deep the falling wretch would strike,"
992,THE EXILE'S SECRET,To writhe at leisure on a boarder's pike.
993,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"By day armed always; double-armed at night,"
994,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
995,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His tools lay round him; wake him such as might.
996,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"A carbine hung beside his India fan,"
997,THE EXILE'S SECRET,His hand could reach a Turkish ataghan;
998,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Pistols, with quaint-carved stocks and barrels gilt,"
999,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Crossed a long dagger with a jewelled hilt;
1000,THE EXILE'S SECRET,A slashing cutlass stretched along the bed;--
1001,THE EXILE'S SECRET,All this was what those lying boatmen said.
1002,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Then some were full of wondrous stories told
1003,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of great oak chests and cupboards full of gold;
1004,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Of the wedged ingots and the silver bars
1005,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That cost old pirates ugly sabre-scars;
1006,THE EXILE'S SECRET,How his laced wallet often would disgorge
1007,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The fresh-faced guinea of an English George,"
1008,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or sweated ducat, palmed by Jews of yore,"
1009,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Or double Joe, or Portuguese moidore;"
1010,THE EXILE'S SECRET,And how his finger wore a rubied ring
1011,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Fit for the white-necked play-girl of a king.
1012,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But these fine legends, told with staring eyes,"
1013,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Met with small credence from the old and wise.
1014,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1015,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Why tell each idle guess, each whisper vain?"
1016,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Enough: the scorched and cindered beams remain.
1017,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He came, a silent pilgrim to the West,"
1018,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Some old-world mystery throbbing in his breast;
1019,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Close to the thronging mart he dwelt alone;
1020,THE EXILE'S SECRET,He lived; he died. The rest is all unknown.
1021,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1022,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Stranger, whose eyes the shadowy isle survey,"
1023,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"As the black steamer dashes through the bay,"
1024,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Why ask his buried secret to divine?
1025,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"He was thy brother; speak, and tell us thine!"
1026,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1027,THE EXILE'S SECRET,. . . . . . . . . . .
1028,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1029,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Silence at first, a kind of spell-bound pause;"
1030,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Then all the Teacups tinkled their applause;
1031,THE EXILE'S SECRET,When that was hushed no sound the stillness broke
1032,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Till once again the soft-voiced lady spoke:
1033,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1034,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""The Lover's Secret,--surely that must need"
1035,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The youngest voice our table holds to read.
1036,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Which of our two 'Annexes' shall we choose?
1037,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Either were charming, neither will refuse;"
1038,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"But choose we must,--what better can we do"
1039,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Than take the younger of the youthful two?"""
1040,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1041,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"True to the primal instinct of her sex,"
1042,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""Why, that means me,"" half whispered each Annex."
1043,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""What if it does?"" the voiceless question came,"
1044,THE EXILE'S SECRET,That set those pale New England cheeks aflame;
1045,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"""Our old-world scholar may have ways to teach"
1046,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"Of Oxford English, Britain's purest speech,--"
1047,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"She shall be youngest,--youngest for _to-day_,--"
1048,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Our dates we'll fix hereafter as we may;
1049,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"_All rights reserved_,--the words we know so well,"
1050,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"That guard the claims of books which never sell."""
1051,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"The British maiden bowed a pleased assent,"
1052,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Her two long ringlets swinging as she bent;
1053,THE EXILE'S SECRET,The glistening eyes her eager soul looked through
1054,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Betrayed her lineage in their Saxon blue.
1055,THE EXILE'S SECRET,Backward she flung each too obtrusive curl
1056,THE EXILE'S SECRET,"And thus began,--the rose-lipped English girl."
1057,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1058,THE EXILE'S SECRET,
1059,THE LOVER'S SECRET,THE LOVER'S SECRET
1060,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1061,THE LOVER'S SECRET,WHAT ailed young Lucius? Art had vainly tried
1062,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"To guess his ill, and found herself defied."
1063,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The Augur plied his legendary skill;
1064,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Useless; the fair young Roman languished still.
1065,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His chariot took him every cloudless day
1066,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Along the Pincian Hill or Appian Way;
1067,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They rubbed his wasted limbs with sulphurous oil,"
1068,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Oozed from the far-off Orient's heated soil;
1069,THE LOVER'S SECRET,They led him tottering down the steamy path
1070,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Where bubbling fountains filled the thermal bath;
1071,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Borne in his litter to Egeria's cave,"
1072,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They washed him, shivering, in her icy wave."
1073,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They sought all curious herbs and costly stones,"
1074,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They scraped the moss that grew on dead men's bones,"
1075,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"They tried all cures the votive tablets taught,"
1076,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Scoured every place whence healing drugs were brought,"
1077,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"O'er Thracian hills his breathless couriers ran,"
1078,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His slaves waylaid the Syrian caravan.
1079,THE LOVER'S SECRET,At last a servant heard a stranger speak
1080,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A new chirurgeon's name; a clever Greek,"
1081,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Skilled in his art; from Pergamus he came
1082,THE LOVER'S SECRET,To Rome but lately; GALEN was the name.
1083,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The Greek was called: a man with piercing eyes,"
1084,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Who must be cunning, and who might be wise."
1085,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"He spoke but little,--if they pleased, he said,"
1086,THE LOVER'S SECRET,He 'd wait awhile beside the sufferer's bed.
1087,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"So by his side he sat, serene and calm,"
1088,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His very accents soft as healing balm;
1089,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Not curious seemed, but every movement spied,"
1090,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His sharp eyes searching where they seemed to glide;
1091,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Asked a few questions,--what he felt, and where?"
1092,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""A pain just here,"" ""A constant beating there."""
1093,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Who ordered bathing for his aches and ails?
1094,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""Charmis, the water-doctor from Marseilles."""
1095,THE LOVER'S SECRET,What was the last prescription in his case?
1096,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""A draught of wine with powdered chrysoprase."""
1097,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Had he no secret grief he nursed alone?
1098,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A pause; a little tremor; answer,--""None."""
1099,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Thoughtful, a moment, sat the cunning leech,"
1100,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"And muttered ""Eros!"" in his native speech."
1101,THE LOVER'S SECRET,In the broad atrium various friends await
1102,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The last new utterance from the lips of fate;
1103,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Men, matrons, maids, they talk the question o'er,"
1104,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"And, restless, pace the tessellated floor."
1105,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Not unobserved the youth so long had pined
1106,THE LOVER'S SECRET,By gentle-hearted dames and damsels kind;
1107,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"One with the rest, a rich Patrician's pride,"
1108,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The lady Hermia, called ""the golden-eyed"";"
1109,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The same the old Proconsul fain must woo,"
1110,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Whom, one dark night, a masked sicarius slew;"
1111,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The same black Crassus over roughly pressed
1112,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"To hear his suit,--the Tiber knows the rest."
1113,THE LOVER'S SECRET,(Crassus was missed next morning by his set;
1114,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Next week the fishers found him in their net.)
1115,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"She with the others paced the ample hall,"
1116,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Fairest, alas! and saddest of them all."
1117,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1118,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"At length the Greek declared, with puzzled face,"
1119,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Some strange enchantment mingled in the case,"
1120,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And naught would serve to act as counter-charm
1121,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Save a warm bracelet from a maiden's arm.
1122,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Not every maiden's,--many might be tried;"
1123,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Which not in vain, experience must decide."
1124,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Were there no damsels willing to attend
1125,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And do such service for a suffering friend?
1126,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The message passed among the waiting crowd,"
1127,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"First in a whisper, then proclaimed aloud."
1128,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Some wore no jewels; some were disinclined,"
1129,THE LOVER'S SECRET,For reasons better guessed at than defined;
1130,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Though all were saints,--at least professed to be,--"
1131,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The list all counted, there were named but three."
1132,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The leech, still seated by the patient's side,"
1133,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Held his thin wrist, and watched him, eagle-eyed."
1134,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Aurelia first, a fair-haired Tuscan girl,"
1135,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Slipped off her golden asp, with eyes of pearl."
1136,THE LOVER'S SECRET,His solemn head the grave physician shook;
1137,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The waxen features thanked her with a look.
1138,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Olympia next, a creature half divine,"
1139,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Sprung from the blood of old Evander's line,"
1140,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Held her white arm, that wore a twisted chain"
1141,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Clasped with an opal-sheeny cymophane.
1142,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"In vain, O daughter I said the baffled Greek."
1143,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The patient sighed the thanks he could not speak.
1144,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1145,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Last, Hermia entered; look, that sudden start!"
1146,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The pallium heaves above his leaping heart;
1147,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The beating pulse, the cheek's rekindled flame,"
1148,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Those quivering lips, the secret all proclaim."
1149,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The deep disease long throbbing in the breast,"
1150,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"The dread enchantment, all at once confessed!"
1151,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The case was plain; the treatment was begun;
1152,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And Love soon cured the mischief he had done.
1153,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1154,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Young Love, too oft thy treacherous bandage slips"
1155,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Down from the eyes it blinded to the lips!
1156,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Ask not the Gods, O youth, for clearer sight,"
1157,THE LOVER'S SECRET,But the bold heart to plead thy cause aright.
1158,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"And thou, fair maiden, when thy lovers sigh,"
1159,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Suspect thy flattering ear, but trust thine eye;"
1160,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And learn this secret from the tale of old
1161,THE LOVER'S SECRET,No love so true as love that dies untold.
1162,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1163,THE LOVER'S SECRET,. . . . . . . . . .
1164,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1165,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""Bravo, Annex!"" they shouted, every one,--"
1166,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""Not Mrs. Kemble's self had better done."""
1167,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""Quite so,"" she stammered in her awkward way,--"
1168,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Not just the thing, but something she must say."
1169,THE LOVER'S SECRET,
1170,THE LOVER'S SECRET,The teaspoon chorus tinkled to its close
1171,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"When from his chair the MAN OF LAW arose,"
1172,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Called by her voice whose mandate all obeyed,"
1173,THE LOVER'S SECRET,And took the open volume she displayed.
1174,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Tall, stately, strong, his form begins to own"
1175,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Some slight exuberance in its central zone,--"
1176,THE LOVER'S SECRET,That comely fulness of the growing girth
1177,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Which fifty summers lend the sons of earth.
1178,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A smooth, round disk about whose margin stray,"
1179,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Above the temples, glistening threads of gray;"
1180,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Strong, deep-cut grooves by toilsome decades wrought"
1181,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"On brow and mouth, the battle-fields of thought;"
1182,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A voice that lingers in the listener's ear,"
1183,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"Grave, calm, far-reaching, every accent clear,--"
1184,THE LOVER'S SECRET,(Those tones resistless many a foreman knew
1185,THE LOVER'S SECRET,That shaped their verdict ere the twelve withdrew;)
1186,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"A statesman's forehead, athlete's throat and jaw,"
1187,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Such the proud semblance of the Man of Law.
1188,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"His eye just lighted on the printed leaf,"
1189,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Held as a practised pleader holds his brief.
1190,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"One whispered softly from behind his cup,"
1191,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"""He does not read,--his book is wrong side up!"
1192,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"He knows the story that it holds by heart,--"
1193,THE LOVER'S SECRET,"So like his own! How well he'll act his part!"""
1194,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Then all were silent; not a rustling fan
1195,THE LOVER'S SECRET,Stirred the deep stillness as the voice began.

1200,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"WHO of all statesmen is his country's pride,"
1201,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Her councils' prompter and her leaders' guide?
1202,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,He speaks; the nation holds its breath to hear;
1203,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"He nods, and shakes the sunset hemisphere."
1204,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Born where the primal fount of Nature springs
1205,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"By the rude cradles of her throneless kings,"
1206,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"In his proud eye her royal signet flames,"
1207,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,By his own lips her Monarch she proclaims.
1208,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Why name his countless triumphs, whom to meet"

1211,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Who fire one shot, and finish with the knife,"
1212,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Tried him but once, and, cowering in their shame,"
1213,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Ground their hacked blades to strike at meaner game.
1214,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"The lordly chief, his party's central stay,"
1215,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Whose lightest word a hundred votes obey,"
1216,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Found a new listener seated at his side,"
1217,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Looked in his eye, and felt himself defied,"
1218,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Flung his rash gauntlet on the startled floor,"
1219,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Met the all-conquering, fought,--and ruled no more."
1220,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"See where he moves, what eager crowds attend!"
1221,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,What shouts of thronging multitudes ascend!
1222,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"If this is life,--to mark with every hour"
1223,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"The purple deepening in his robes of power,"
1224,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,To see the painted fruits of honor fall
1225,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Thick at his feet, and choose among them all,"
1226,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,To hear the sounds that shape his spreading name
1227,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Peal through the myriad organ-stops of fame,"
1228,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Stamp the lone isle that spots the seaman's chart,"
1229,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"And crown the pillared glory of the mart,"
1230,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,To count as peers the few supremely wise
1231,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Who mark their planet in the angels' eyes,--"
1232,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,If this is life--
1233,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,What savage man is he
1234,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Who strides alone beside the sounding sea?
1235,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Alone he wanders by the murmuring shore,"
1236,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,His thoughts as restless as the waves that roar;

1238,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"As on the waves yon tempest-brooding cloud,"
1239,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Heaves from his aching breast a wailing sigh,"
1240,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Sad as the gust that sweeps the clouded sky.
1241,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Ask him his griefs; what midnight demons plough
1242,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,The lines of torture on his lofty brow;
1243,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Unlock those marble lips, and bid them speak"
1244,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,The mystery freezing in his bloodless cheek.
1245,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,His secret? Hid beneath a flimsy word;
1246,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,One foolish whisper that ambition heard;
1247,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"And thus it spake: ""Behold yon gilded chair,"
1248,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"The world's one vacant throne,--thy plate is there!"""
1249,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,

1258,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Illustrious Dupe! Have those majestic eyes
1259,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Lost their proud fire for such a vulgar prize?
1260,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Art thou the last of all mankind to know
1261,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,That party-fights are won by aiming low?
1262,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Thou, stamped by Nature with her royal sign,"
1263,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,That party-hirelings hate a look like thine?
1264,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Shake from thy sense the wild delusive dream
1265,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Without the purple, art thou not supreme?"
1266,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"And soothed by love unbought, thy heart shall own"

1273,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Used to the tributes of the noisy crowd,"
1274,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,The stately speaker calmly smiled and bowed;
1275,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"The fire within a flushing cheek betrayed,"
1276,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,And eyes that burned beneath their penthouse shade.

1286,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,Sweet as the voice a dreaming vestal hears;
1287,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,"Soft as the murmur of a brooding dove,"
1288,THE STATESMAN'S SECRET,It told the mystery of a mother's love.

1294,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,In my slight verse such holy things are named--
1295,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Of Mary's secret hours of hidden joy,"
1296,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Silent, but pondering on her wondrous boy!"
1297,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Ave, Maria! Pardon, if I wrong"
1298,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Those heavenly words that shame my earthly song!
1299,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The choral host had closed the Angel's strain
1300,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Sung to the listening watch on Bethlehem's plain,"
1301,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And now the shepherds, hastening on their way,"
1302,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Sought the still hamlet where the Infant lay.
1303,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They passed the fields that gleaning Ruth toiled o'er,--"
1304,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,They saw afar the ruined threshing-floor
1305,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Where Moab's daughter, homeless and forlorn,"
1306,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Found Boaz slumbering by his heaps of corn;
1307,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And some remembered how the holy scribe,"
1308,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Skilled in the lore of every jealous tribe,"
1309,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Traced the warm blood of Jesse's royal son
1310,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"To that fair alien, bravely wooed and won."
1311,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"So fared they on to seek the promised sign,"
1312,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,That marked the anointed heir of David's line.
1313,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"At last, by forms of earthly semblance led,"
1314,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They found the crowded inn, the oxen's shed."
1315,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,
1316,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"No pomp was there, no glory shone around"
1317,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,On the coarse straw that strewed the reeking ground;
1318,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"One dim retreat a flickering torch betrayed,--"
1319,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,In that poor cell the Lord of Life was laid
1320,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The wondering shepherds told their breathless tale
1321,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Of the bright choir that woke the sleeping vale;
1322,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Told how the skies with sudden glory flamed,"
1323,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Told how the shining multitude proclaimed,"
1324,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"""Joy, joy to earth! Behold the hallowed morn"

1328,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,They spoke with hurried words and accents wild;
1329,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Calm in his cradle slept the heavenly child.
1330,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"No trembling word the mother's joy revealed,--"
1331,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"One sigh of rapture, and her lips were sealed;"
1332,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Unmoved she saw the rustic train depart,"
1333,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,But kept their words to ponder in her heart.
1334,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,
1335,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Twelve years had passed; the boy was fair and tall,"
1336,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Growing in wisdom, finding grace with all."
1337,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The maids of Nazareth, as they trooped to fill"
1338,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their balanced urns beside the mountain rill,"
1339,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The gathered matrons, as they sat and spun,"
1340,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Spoke in soft words of Joseph's quiet son.
1341,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,No voice had reached the Galilean vale
1342,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Of star-led kings, or awe-struck shepherd's tale;"
1343,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"In the meek, studious child they only saw"
1344,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The future Rabbi, learned in Israel's law."
1345,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,

1348,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Snatched from the steel of Herod's murdering bands,"
1349,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"A babe, close folded to his mother's breast,"
1350,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Through Edom's wilds he sought the sheltering West.
1351,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Then Joseph spake: ""Thy boy hath largely grown;"
1352,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Weave him fine raiment, fitting to be shown;"
1353,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Fair robes beseem the pilgrim, as the priest;"
1354,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Goes he not with us to the holy feast?"""
1355,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,And Mary culled the flaxen fibres white;
1356,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Till eve she spun; she spun till morning light.
1357,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The thread was twined; its parting meshes through
1358,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"From hand to hand her restless shuttle flew,"
1359,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Till the full web was wound upon the beam;
1360,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Love's curious toil,--a vest without a seam!"
1361,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They reach the Holy Place, fulfil the days"
1362,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"To solemn feasting given, and grateful praise."
1363,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"At last they turn, and far Moriah's height"
1364,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Melts in the southern sky and fades from sight.
1365,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,All day the dusky caravan has flowed
1366,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,In devious trails along the winding road;

1368,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,And all the sons of Abraham are as friends.)
1369,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Evening has come,--the hour of rest and joy,--"
1370,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Hush! Hush! That whisper,--""Where is Mary's boy?"""
1371,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Oh, weary hour! Oh, aching days that passed"
1372,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Filled with strange fears each wilder than the last,--"
1373,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The soldier's lance, the fierce centurion's sword,"
1374,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The crushing wheels that whirl some Roman lord,"
1375,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The midnight crypt that sucks the captive's breath,"
1376,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The blistering sun on Hinnom's vale of death!
1377,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Thrice on his cheek had rained the morning light;
1378,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Thrice on his lips the mildewed kiss of night,"
1379,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Crouched by a sheltering column's shining plinth,"
1380,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Or stretched beneath the odorous terebinth.
1381,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"At last, in desperate mood, they sought once more"
1382,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The Temple's porches, searched in vain before;"
1383,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"They found him seated with the ancient men,--"

1385,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their bald heads glistening as they clustered near,"
1386,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Their gray beards slanting as they turned to hear,"
1387,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,Lost in half-envious wonder and surprise
1388,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,That lips so fresh should utter words so wise.
1389,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"And Mary said,--as one who, tried too long,"
1390,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Tells all her grief and half her sense of wrong,--"
1391,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,What is this thoughtless thing which thou hast done?
1392,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Lo, we have sought thee sorrowing, O my son!"
1393,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Few words he spake, and scarce of filial tone,"
1394,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Strange words, their sense a mystery yet unknown;"
1395,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"Then turned with them and left the holy hill,"
1396,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,To all their mild commands obedient still.
1397,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The tale was told to Nazareth's sober men,"
1398,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,And Nazareth's matrons told it oft again;
1399,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"The maids retold it at the fountain's side,"
1400,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,The youthful shepherds doubted or denied;
1401,THE MOTHER'S SECRET,"It passed around among the listening friends,"
