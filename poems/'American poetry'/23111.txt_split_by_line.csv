54,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,The bookman he's a humming-bird--
55,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"His feasts are honey-fine,--"
56,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With hi! hilloo!
57,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And clover-dew
58,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And roses lush and rare!)
59,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,_His_ roses are the phrase and word
60,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,Of olden tomes divine;
61,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With hi! and ho!
62,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And pinks ablow
63,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And posies everywhere!)
64,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"The Bookman he's a humming-bird,--"
65,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,He steals from song to song--
66,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"He scents the ripest-blooming rhyme,"
67,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And takes his heart along
68,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And sacks all sweets of bursting verse
69,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And ballads, throng on throng."
70,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With ho! and hey!
71,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And brook and brae,"
72,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And brinks of shade and shine!)
73,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,
74,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,A humming-bird the Bookman is--
75,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"Though cumbrous, gray and grim,--"
76,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With hi! hilloo!
77,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And honey-dew
78,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And odors musty-rare!)
79,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,He bends him o'er that page of his
80,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,As o'er the rose's rim.
81,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With hi! and ho!
82,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And pinks aglow
83,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And roses everywhere!)
84,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"Ay, he's the featest humming-bird,"
85,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,On airiest of wings
86,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,He poises pendent o'er the poem
87,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,That blossoms as it sings--
88,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,God friend him as he dips his beak
89,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,In such delicious things!
90,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,(With ho! and hey!
91,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And world away
92,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And only dreams for him!)

97,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"O friends of mine, whose kindly words come to me"
98,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"Voiced only in lost lisps of ink and pen,"
99,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"If I had power to tell the good you do me,"
100,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And how the blood you warm goes laughing through me,"
101,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,My tongue would babble baby-talk again.
102,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,
103,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And I would toddle round the world to meet you--
104,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"Fall at your feet, and clamber to your knees"
105,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And with glad, happy hands would reach and greet you,"
106,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And twine my arms about you, and entreat you"
107,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,For leave to weave a thousand rhymes like these--
108,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,
109,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,A thousand rhymes enwrought of nought but presses
110,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"Of cherry-lip and apple-cheek and chin,"
111,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,"And pats of honeyed palms, and rare caresses,"
112,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,And all the sweets of which as Fancy guesses
113,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY,She folds away her wings and swoons therein.
