110,NERO,
111,NERO,"This Rome, that was the toil of many men,"
112,NERO,The consummation of laborious years--
113,NERO,"Fulfilment's crown to visions of the dead,"
114,NERO,And image of the wide desire of kings--
115,NERO,"Is made my darkling dream's effulgency,"
116,NERO,"Fuel of vision, brief embodiment"
117,NERO,"Of wandering will, and wastage of the strong"
118,NERO,"Fierce ecstacy of one tremendous hour,"
119,NERO,When ages piled on ages were a flame
120,NERO,"To all the years behind, and years to be."
121,NERO,
122,NERO,"Yet any sunset were as much as this,"
123,NERO,Save for the music forced by hands of fire
124,NERO,From out the hard strait silences which bind
125,NERO,Dull Matter's tongueless mouth--a music pierced
126,NERO,"With the tense voice of Life, more quick to cry"
127,NERO,Its agony--and save that I believed
128,NERO,The radiance redder for the blood of men.
129,NERO,Destruction hastens and intensifies
130,NERO,"The process that is Beauty, manifests"
131,NERO,"Ranges of form unknown before, and gives"
132,NERO,Motion and voice and hue where otherwise
133,NERO,Bleak inexpressiveness had leveled all.
134,NERO,
135,NERO,"If one create, there is the lengthy toil;"
136,NERO,The laboured years and days league tow'rd an end
137,NERO,"Less than the measure of desire, mayhap,"
138,NERO,"After the sure consuming of all strength,"
139,NERO,And strain of faculties that otherwhere
140,NERO,Were loosed upon enjoyment; and at last
141,NERO,Remains to one capacity nor power
142,NERO,For pleasure in the thing that he hath made.
143,NERO,But on destruction hangs but little use
144,NERO,"Of time or faculty, but all is turned"
145,NERO,"To the one purpose, unobstructed, pure,"
146,NERO,Of sensuous rapture and observant joy;
147,NERO,"And from the intensities of death and ruin,"
148,NERO,"One draws a heightened and completer life,"
149,NERO,And both extends and vindicates himself.
150,NERO,
151,NERO,"I would I were a god, with all the scope"
152,NERO,Of attributes that are the essential core
153,NERO,"Of godhead, and its visibility."
154,NERO,"I am but emperor, and hold awhile"
155,NERO,"The power to hasten Death upon his way,"
156,NERO,And cry a halt to worn and lagging Life
157,NERO,"For others, but for mine own self may not"
158,NERO,"Delay the one, nor bid the other speed."
159,NERO,"There have been many kings, and they are dead,"
160,NERO,And have no power in death save what the wind
161,NERO,Confers upon their blown and brainless dust
162,NERO,To vex the eyeballs of posterity.
163,NERO,"But were I god, I would be overlord"
164,NERO,"Of many kings, and were as breath to guide"
165,NERO,"Their dust of destiny. And were I god,"
166,NERO,Exempt from this mortality which clogs
167,NERO,"Perception, and clear exercise of will,"
168,NERO,"What rapture it would be, if but to watch"
169,NERO,"Destruction crouching at the back of Time,"
170,NERO,The tongueless dooms which dog the travelling suns;
171,NERO,"The vampire Silence at the breast of worlds,"
172,NERO,"Fire without light that gnaws the base of things,"
173,NERO,"And Lethe's mounting tide, that rots the stone"
174,NERO,Of fundamental spheres. This were enough
175,NERO,Till such time as the dazzled wings of will
176,NERO,"Came up with power's accession, scarcely felt"
177,NERO,For very suddenness. Then would I urge
178,NERO,The strong contention and conflicting might
179,NERO,"Of chaos and creation, matching them,"
180,NERO,"Those immemorial powers inimical,"
181,NERO,And all their stars and gulfs subservient--
182,NERO,"Dynasts of Time, and anarchs of the dark--"
183,NERO,In closer war reverseless; and would set
184,NERO,"New discord at the universal core,"
185,NERO,A Samson-principle to bring it down
186,NERO,"In one magnificence of ruin. Yea,"
187,NERO,"The monster Chaos were mine unleashed hound,"
188,NERO,And all my power Destruction's own right arm!
189,NERO,
190,NERO,I would exult to mark the smouldering stars
191,NERO,"Renew beneath my breath their elder fire,"
192,NERO,And feed upon themselves to nothingness.
193,NERO,"The might of suns, slow-paced with swinging weight"
194,NERO,"Of myriad worlds, were made at my desire"
195,NERO,"One long rapidity of roaring light,"
196,NERO,"Through which the voice of Life were audible,"
197,NERO,And singing of the immemorial dead
198,NERO,Whose dust is loosened into vaporous wings
199,NERO,With soaring wrack of systems ruinous.
200,NERO,"And were I weary of the glare of these,"
201,NERO,"I would tear out the eyes of light, and stand"
202,NERO,"Above a chaos of extinguished suns,"
203,NERO,"That crowd, and grind, and shiver thunderously,"
204,NERO,"Lending vast voice and motion, but no ray"
205,NERO,To the stretched silence of the blinded gulfs.
206,NERO,Thus would I give my godhead space and speech
207,NERO,"For its assertion, and thus pleasure it,"
208,NERO,Hastening the feet of Time with casts of worlds
209,NERO,"Like careless pebbles, or with shattered suns"
210,NERO,Brightening the aspect of Eternity.

217,CHANT TO SIRIUS,
218,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"What nights retard thee, O Sirius!"
219,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Thy light is as a spear,"
220,CHANT TO SIRIUS,And thou penetratest them
221,CHANT TO SIRIUS,As a warrior that stabbeth his foe
222,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Even to the center of his life.
223,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Thy rays reach farther than the gulfs;
224,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"They form a bridge thereover,"
225,CHANT TO SIRIUS,That shall endure till the links of the universe
226,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Are unfastened, and drop apart,"
227,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"And all the gulfs are one,"
228,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Dissevered by suns no longer.
229,CHANT TO SIRIUS,
230,CHANT TO SIRIUS,How strong art thou in thy place!
231,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Thou stridest thine orbit,"
232,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"And the darkness shakes beneath thee,"
233,CHANT TO SIRIUS,As a road that is trodden by an army.
234,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Thou art a god,"
235,CHANT TO SIRIUS,In thy temple that is hollowed with light
236,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"In the night of infinitude,"
237,CHANT TO SIRIUS,And whose floor is the lower void;
238,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Thy worlds are as priests and ministers therein.
239,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Thou furrowest space,"
240,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"Even as an husbandman,"
241,CHANT TO SIRIUS,And sowest it with alien seed;
242,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"It beareth alien fruits,"
243,CHANT TO SIRIUS,"And these are thy testimony,"
244,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Even as the crops of his fields
245,CHANT TO SIRIUS,Are the testimony of an husbandman.

252,THE STAR-TREADER,
253,I,I
254,I,
255,I,"A voice cried to me in a dawn of dreams,"
256,I,"Saying, ""Make haste: the webs of death and birth"
257,I,"Are brushed away, and all the threads of earth"
258,I,Wear to the breaking; spaceward gleams
259,I,"Thine ancient pathway of the suns,"
260,I,Whose flame is part of thee;
261,I,And deeps outreach immutably
262,I,Whose largeness runs
263,I,Through all thy spirit's mystery.
264,I,"Go forth, and tread unharmed the blaze"
265,I,Of stars where through thou camest in old days;
266,I,Pierce without fear each vast
267,I,Whose hugeness crushed thee not within the past.
268,I,"A hand strikes off the chains of Time,"
269,I,A hand swings back the door of years;
270,I,"Now fall earth's bonds of gladness and of tears,"
271,I,"And opens the strait dream to space sublime."""
272,I,
273,I,
274,II,II
275,II,
276,II,"Who rides a dream, what hand shall stay!"
277,II,What eye shall note or measure mete
278,II,"His passage on a purpose fleet,"
279,II,The thread and weaving of his way!
280,II,"It caught me from the clasping world,"
281,II,"And swept beyond the brink of Sense,"
282,II,"My soul was flung, and poised, and whirled,"
283,II,Like to a planet chained and hurled
284,II,With solar lightning strong and tense.
285,II,Swift as communicated rays
286,II,That leap from severed suns a gloom
287,II,"Within whose waste no suns illume,"
288,II,The wingèd dream fulfilled its ways.
289,II,Through years reversed and lit again
290,II,I followed that unending chain
291,II,Wherein the suns are links of light;
292,II,"Retraced through lineal, ordered spheres"
293,II,The twisting of the threads of years
294,II,In weavings wrought of noon and night;
295,II,"Through stars and deeps I watched the dream unroll,"
296,II,Those folds that form the raiment of the soul.
297,II,
298,II,
299,III,III
300,III,
301,III,"Enkindling dawns of memory,"
302,III,Each sun had radiance to relume
303,III,"A sealed, disused, and darkened room"
304,III,Within the soul's immensity.
305,III,"Their alien ciphers shown and lit,"
306,III,I understood what each had writ
307,III,Upon my spirit's scroll;
308,III,"Again I wore mine ancient lives,"
309,III,And knew the freedom and the gyves
310,III,That formed and marked my soul.
311,III,
312,III,
313,IV,IV
314,IV,
315,IV,"I delved in each forgotten mind,"
316,IV,"The units that had builded me,"
317,IV,Whose deepnesses before were blind
318,IV,And formless as infinity--
319,IV,Knowing again each former world--
320,IV,From planet unto planet whirled
321,IV,Through gulfs that mightily divide
322,IV,Like to an intervital sleep.
323,IV,"One world I found, where souls abide"
324,IV,Like winds that rest upon a rose;
325,IV,Thereto they creep
326,IV,To loose all burden of old woes.
327,IV,"And one I knew, where warp of pain"
328,IV,Is woven in the soul's attire;
329,IV,"And one, where with new loveliness"
330,IV,Is strengthened Beauty's olden chain--
331,IV,"Soft as a sound, and keen as fire--"
332,IV,In light no darkness may depress.
333,IV,
334,IV,
335,V,V
336,V,
337,V,Where no terrestrial dreams had trod
338,V,"My vision entered undismayed,"
339,V,And Life her hidden realms displayed
340,V,To me as to a curious god.
341,V,Where colored suns of systems triplicate
342,V,"Bestow on planets weird, ineffable,"
343,V,"Green light that orbs them like an outer sea,"
344,V,And large auroral noons that alternate
345,V,"With skies like sunset held without abate,"
346,V,Life's touch renewed incomprehensibly
347,V,The strains of mirth and grief's harmonious spell.
348,V,Dead passions like to stars relit
349,V,Shone in the gloom of ways forgot;
350,V,Where crownless gods in darkness sit
351,V,The day was full on altars hot.
352,V,I heard--once more a part of it--
353,V,"The central music of the Pleiades,"
354,V,And to Alcyone my soul
355,V,Swayed with the stars that own her song's control.
356,V,"Unchallenged, glad I trod, a revenant"
357,V,In worlds Edenic longly lost;
358,V,"Or walked in spheres that sing to these,"
359,V,"O'er space no light has crossed,"
360,V,Diverse as Hell's mad antiphone uptossed
361,V,To Heaven's angelic chant.
362,V,
363,V,
364,VI,VI
365,VI,
366,VI,What vasts the dream went out to find!
367,VI,I seemed beyond the world's recall
368,VI,In gulfs where darkness is a wall
369,VI,To render strong Antares blind!
370,VI,In unimagined spheres I found
371,VI,The sequence of my being's round--
372,VI,"Some life where firstling meed of Song,"
373,VI,"The strange imperishable leaf,"
374,VI,Was placed on brows that starry Grief
375,VI,"Had crowned, and Pain anointed long;"
376,VI,Some avatar where Love
377,VI,Sang like the last great star at morn
378,VI,Ere Death filled all its sky;
379,VI,Some life in fresher years unworn
380,VI,Upon a world whereof
381,VI,Peace was a robe like to the calms that lie
382,VI,On pools aglow with latter spring:
383,VI,There Life's pellucid surface took
384,VI,"Clear image of all things, nor shook"
385,VI,Till touch of Death's obscuring wing;
386,VI,Some earlier awakening
387,VI,"In pristine years, when giant strife"
388,VI,Of forces darkly whirled
389,VI,First forged the thing called Life--
390,VI,Hot from the furnace of the suns--
391,VI,Upon the anvil of a world.
392,VI,
393,VI,
394,VII,VII
395,VII,
396,VII,Thus knew I those anterior ones
397,VII,Whose lives in mine were blent;
398,VII,"Till, lo! my dream, that held a night"
399,VII,"Where Rigel sends no word of might,"
400,VII,"Was emptied of the trodden stars,"
401,VII,And dwindled to the sun's extent--
402,VII,"The brain's familiar prison-bars,"
403,VII,And raiment of the sorrow and the mirth
404,VII,Wrought by the shuttles intricate of earth.

409,THE MORNING POOL,THE MORNING POOL
410,THE MORNING POOL,
411,THE MORNING POOL,
412,THE MORNING POOL,"All night the pool held mysteries,"
413,THE MORNING POOL,"Vague depths of night that lay in dream,"
414,THE MORNING POOL,Where phantoms of the pale-white stars
415,THE MORNING POOL,"Wandered, with darkness-tangled gleam."
416,THE MORNING POOL,
417,THE MORNING POOL,And now it holds the limpid light
418,THE MORNING POOL,"And shadeless azure of the skies,"
419,THE MORNING POOL,"Wherein, like some enclaspèd gem,"
420,THE MORNING POOL,The morning's golden glamour lies.

425,THE NIGHT FOREST,THE NIGHT FOREST
426,THE NIGHT FOREST,
427,THE NIGHT FOREST,
428,THE NIGHT FOREST,Incumbent seemingly
429,THE NIGHT FOREST,On the jagged points of peaks
430,THE NIGHT FOREST,"That end the visible west,"
431,THE NIGHT FOREST,The rounded moon yet floods
432,THE NIGHT FOREST,The valleys hitherward
433,THE NIGHT FOREST,"With fall of torrential light,"
434,THE NIGHT FOREST,Ere from the overmost
435,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Aggressive mountain-cusp,"
436,THE NIGHT FOREST,She slip to the lower dark.
437,THE NIGHT FOREST,"But here, on an eastward slope"
438,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Pointed and thick with its pine,"
439,THE NIGHT FOREST,The forest scarcely remembers
440,THE NIGHT FOREST,Her light that is gone as a vision
441,THE NIGHT FOREST,Or ecstasy too poignant
442,THE NIGHT FOREST,And perilous for duration.
443,THE NIGHT FOREST,Withdrawn in what darker web
444,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Or dimension of dream I know not,"
445,THE NIGHT FOREST,In silence pre-occupied
446,THE NIGHT FOREST,And solemnest rectitude
447,THE NIGHT FOREST,"The pines uprear, and no sigh"
448,THE NIGHT FOREST,"For the rapture of moonlight past,"
449,THE NIGHT FOREST,Comes from their bosom of boughs.
450,THE NIGHT FOREST,Far in their secrecy
451,THE NIGHT FOREST,"I stand, and the burden of dusk"
452,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Dull, but at times made keen"
453,THE NIGHT FOREST,"With tingle of fragrances,"
454,THE NIGHT FOREST,Falls on me as a veil
455,THE NIGHT FOREST,Between my soul and the world.
456,THE NIGHT FOREST,
457,THE NIGHT FOREST,"What veil of trance, O pines,"
458,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Divides you from my soul,"
459,THE NIGHT FOREST,That I feel but enter not
460,THE NIGHT FOREST,Your distances of dream?
461,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Ah! strange, imperative sense"
462,THE NIGHT FOREST,Of world-deep mystery
463,THE NIGHT FOREST,That shakes from out your boughs--
464,THE NIGHT FOREST,"A fragrance yet more keen,"
465,THE NIGHT FOREST,Pressing upon the mind.
466,THE NIGHT FOREST,
467,THE NIGHT FOREST,The wind shall question you
468,THE NIGHT FOREST,"Of the dream I may not gain,"
469,THE NIGHT FOREST,And all its sombreness
470,THE NIGHT FOREST,"And depth immeasurable,"
471,THE NIGHT FOREST,Shall tremble away in sound
472,THE NIGHT FOREST,Of speech not understood
473,THE NIGHT FOREST,That my heart must break to hear.

480,THE MAD WIND,
481,THE MAD WIND,"What hast thou seen, O wind,"
482,THE MAD WIND,Of beauty or of terror
483,THE MAD WIND,"Surpassing, denied to us,"
484,THE MAD WIND,"That with precipitate wings,"
485,THE MAD WIND,"Mad and ecstatical,"
486,THE MAD WIND,Thou spurnest the hollows and trees
487,THE MAD WIND,"That offer thee refuge of peace,"
488,THE MAD WIND,And findest within the sky
489,THE MAD WIND,No safety nor respite
490,THE MAD WIND,From the memory of thy vision?

498,SONG TO OBLIVION,Art thou more fair
499,SONG TO OBLIVION,"For all the beauty gathered up in thee,"
500,SONG TO OBLIVION,As gold and gems within some lightless sea?
501,SONG TO OBLIVION,"For light of flowers, and bloom of tinted air,"
502,SONG TO OBLIVION,Art thou more fair?
503,SONG TO OBLIVION,
504,SONG TO OBLIVION,Art thou more strong
505,SONG TO OBLIVION,For powers that turn to thee as unto sleep?
506,SONG TO OBLIVION,For world and star that find thy ways more deep
507,SONG TO OBLIVION,"Than light may tread, too wearisome for song"
508,SONG TO OBLIVION,Art thou more strong?
509,SONG TO OBLIVION,

522,MEDUSA,"As drear and barren as the glooms of Death,"
523,MEDUSA,"It lies, a windless land of livid dawns,"
524,MEDUSA,"Nude to a desolate firmament, with hills"
525,MEDUSA,"That seem the fleshless earth's outjutting ribs,"
526,MEDUSA,And plains whose face is crossed and rivelled deep
527,MEDUSA,With gullies twisting like a serpent's track.
528,MEDUSA,"The leprous touch of Death is on its stones,"

535,MEDUSA,"That mingle with her hair, the Gorgon reigns."

543,MEDUSA,"Drawn back from dust and ruin of the years,"

545,MEDUSA,The land is claimed of Death: the daylight comes
546,MEDUSA,Half-strangled in the changing webs of cloud
547,MEDUSA,That unseen spiders of bewildered winds
548,MEDUSA,Weave and unweave across the lurid sun
549,MEDUSA,"In upper air. Below, no zephyr comes"
550,MEDUSA,To break with life the circling spell of death.
551,MEDUSA,"Long vapor-serpents twist about the moon,"

554,MEDUSA,That near the socket.

556,MEDUSA,"Thus the land shall be,"

558,MEDUSA,"Till, in the irremeable webs of night"
559,MEDUSA,"The sun is snared, and the corroded moon"
560,MEDUSA,"A dust upon the gulfs, and all the stars"

1818,THE RETRIBUTION,"The hosts of Rome, the Arab and the Goth"
1819,THE RETRIBUTION,"Have left their altars dark, yet stern and wroth"
1820,THE RETRIBUTION,"In olden power they stood, whose wings were fleet,"

1837,TO THE DARKNESS,"Thou hast taken the light of many suns,"
1838,TO THE DARKNESS,And they are sealed in the prison-house of gloom.
1839,TO THE DARKNESS,Even as candle-flames
1840,TO THE DARKNESS,"Hast thou taken the souls of men,"
1841,TO THE DARKNESS,With winds from out a hollow place;
1842,TO THE DARKNESS,"They are hid in the abyss as in a sea,"
1843,TO THE DARKNESS,And the gulfs are over them
1844,TO THE DARKNESS,"As the weight of many peaks,"
1845,TO THE DARKNESS,As the depth of many seas;

1852,TO THE DARKNESS,"In the days that are now of thy realm,"
1853,TO THE DARKNESS,That thou hast sealed with the seal of many deeps;
1854,TO THE DARKNESS,Their feet were as eagles' wings in the quest of Truth--
1855,TO THE DARKNESS,"Aye, mightily they desired her face,"
1856,TO THE DARKNESS,"Hunting her through the lands of life,"
1857,TO THE DARKNESS,As men in the blankness of the waste
1858,TO THE DARKNESS,That seek for a buried treasure-house of kings.
1859,TO THE DARKNESS,But against them were the veils
1860,TO THE DARKNESS,That hands may not rend nor sabers pierce;
1861,TO THE DARKNESS,"And Truth was withheld from them,"
1862,TO THE DARKNESS,"As a water that is seen afar at dawn,"
1863,TO THE DARKNESS,And at noon is lost in the sand
1864,TO THE DARKNESS,Before the feet of the traveller.
1865,TO THE DARKNESS,"The world was a barrenness,"
1866,TO THE DARKNESS,And the gardens were as the waste.
1867,TO THE DARKNESS,"And they turned them to the adventure of the dark,"
1868,TO THE DARKNESS,"To the travelling of the land without roads,"
1869,TO THE DARKNESS,To the sailing of the sea that hath no beacons.
1870,TO THE DARKNESS,Why have they not returned?
1871,TO THE DARKNESS,"Their quest hath found end in thee,"
1872,TO THE DARKNESS,Or surely they had fared
1873,TO THE DARKNESS,"Once more to the place whence they came,"
1874,TO THE DARKNESS,As men that have travelled to a fruitless land.
1875,TO THE DARKNESS,"They have looked on thy face,"

1877,TO THE DARKNESS,"Thy silence is sweeter to them than the voice of love,"
1878,TO THE DARKNESS,Thine embrace more dear than the clasp of the beloved.
1879,TO THE DARKNESS,"They are fed with the emptiness past the veil,"
1880,TO THE DARKNESS,And their hunger is filled;
1881,TO THE DARKNESS,"They have found the waters of peace,"
1882,TO THE DARKNESS,And are athirst no more.
1883,TO THE DARKNESS,"They know a rest that is deeper than the gulfs,"
1884,TO THE DARKNESS,And whose seal is unbreakable as the seal of the void;
1885,TO THE DARKNESS,"They sleep the sleep of the suns,"
1886,TO THE DARKNESS,And the vast is a garment unto them.

2213,A SONG OF DREAMS,"Then spake I in answer, saying,"
2214,A SONG OF DREAMS,"Of my dreams I have made a road,"
2215,A SONG OF DREAMS,And my soul goeth out thereon
2216,A SONG OF DREAMS,"To that unto which no eye hath opened,"
2217,A SONG OF DREAMS,Nor ear become keen to hearken--
2218,A SONG OF DREAMS,To the glories that are shut past all access
2219,A SONG OF DREAMS,Of the keys of sense;
2220,A SONG OF DREAMS,"Whose walls are hidden by the air,"
2221,A SONG OF DREAMS,And whose doors are concealed with clarity.
2222,A SONG OF DREAMS,"And the road is travelled of secret things,"
2223,A SONG OF DREAMS,Coming to me from far--
2224,A SONG OF DREAMS,"Of bodiless powers,"
2225,A SONG OF DREAMS,And beauties without colour or form
2226,A SONG OF DREAMS,Holden by any loveliness seen of earth.
2227,A SONG OF DREAMS,And of my dreams have I builded an inn
2228,A SONG OF DREAMS,Wherein these are as guests.
2229,A SONG OF DREAMS,And unto it come the dead
2230,A SONG OF DREAMS,For a little rest and refuge
2231,A SONG OF DREAMS,"From the hollowness of the unharvestable wind,"
2232,A SONG OF DREAMS,And the burden of too great space.
2233,A SONG OF DREAMS,
2234,A SONG OF DREAMS,"The fields of the past are not void to me,"
2235,A SONG OF DREAMS,Who harvest with the scythe of thought;
2236,A SONG OF DREAMS,Nor the orchards of future years unfruitful
2237,A SONG OF DREAMS,To the hands of visionings.
2238,A SONG OF DREAMS,I have retrieved from the darkness
2239,A SONG OF DREAMS,"The years and the things that were lost,"
2240,A SONG OF DREAMS,"And they are held in the light of my dreams,"
2241,A SONG OF DREAMS,"With the spirits of years unborn,"
2242,A SONG OF DREAMS,And of things yet bodiless.
2243,A SONG OF DREAMS,"As in an hospitable house,"
2244,A SONG OF DREAMS,They shall live while the dreams abide.
2245,A SONG OF DREAMS,

2250,THE BALANCE,
2251,THE BALANCE,
2252,THE BALANCE,The world upheld their pillars for awhile--
2253,THE BALANCE,"Now, where imperial On and Memphis stood,"
2254,THE BALANCE,The hot wind sifts across the solitude
2255,THE BALANCE,"The sand that once was wall and peristyle,"
2256,THE BALANCE,"Or furrows like the main each desert mile,"
2257,THE BALANCE,Where ocean-deep above its ancient food
2258,THE BALANCE,"Of cities fame-forgot, the waste is nude,"
2259,THE BALANCE,Traceless as billows of each sunken pile.
2260,THE BALANCE,
2261,THE BALANCE,"Lo! for that wrong shall vengeance come at last,"
2262,THE BALANCE,"When the devouring earth, in ruin one"
2263,THE BALANCE,"With royal walls and palaces undone,"
2264,THE BALANCE,"And sunk within the desolated past,"
2265,THE BALANCE,"Shall drift, and winds that wrangle through the vast"

2272,SATURN,
2273,SATURN,
2274,SATURN,"Now were the Titans gathered round their king,"
2275,SATURN,In a waste region slipping tow'rd the verge
2276,SATURN,Of drear extremities that clasp the world--
2277,SATURN,"A land half-moulded by the hasty gods,"
2278,SATURN,"And left beneath the bright scorn of the stars,"
2279,SATURN,"Grotesque, misfeatured, blackly gnarled with stone;"
2280,SATURN,Or worn and marred from conflict with the deep
2281,SATURN,"Conterminate, of Chaos. Here they stood,"
2282,SATURN,"Old Saturn midmost, like a central peak"
2283,SATURN,Among the lesser hills that guard its base.
2284,SATURN,"Defeat, that gloamed within each countenance"
2285,SATURN,"Like the first tinge of death, upon a sun"
2286,SATURN,"Gathering like some dusk vapor, found them cold,"
2287,SATURN,"Clumsy of limb, and halting as with weight"
2288,SATURN,Of threatened worlds and trembling firmaments.
2289,SATURN,A wind cried round them like a trumpet-voice
2290,SATURN,"Of phantom hosts--hurried, importunate,"
2291,SATURN,And intermittent with a tightening fear.
2292,SATURN,"Far off the sunset leapt, and the hard clouds,"
2293,SATURN,"Molten among the peaks, seemed furnaces"
2294,SATURN,In which to make the fetters of the world.
2295,SATURN,
2296,SATURN,"Seared by the lightning of the younger gods,"
2297,SATURN,"They saw, beyond the grim and crouching hills,"
2298,SATURN,Those levins thrust like spears into the heart
2299,SATURN,"Of swollen clouds, or tearing through the sky"
2300,SATURN,"Like severing swords. Then, as the Titans watched,"
2301,SATURN,"The night rose like a black, enormous mist"
2302,SATURN,"Around them, wherein naught was visible"
2303,SATURN,Save the sharp levin leaping in the north;
2304,SATURN,"And no sound came, except of seas remote,"
2305,SATURN,That seemed like Chaos ravening past the verge
2306,SATURN,"Of all the world, fed with the crumbling coasts"
2307,SATURN,Of Matter.
2308,SATURN,
2309,SATURN,"Till the moon, discovering"
2310,SATURN,That harsh swart wilderness of sand and stone
2311,SATURN,"Tissued and twisted in chaotic weld,"
2312,SATURN,"Lit with illusory fire each Titan's form,"
2313,SATURN,"They sate in silence, mute as stranded orbs--"
2314,SATURN,"The wrack of Time, upcast on ruinous coasts,"
2315,SATURN,And in the slow withdrawal of the tide
2316,SATURN,Safe for awhile. Small solace did they take
2317,SATURN,From that frore radiance glistering on the dull
2318,SATURN,"Black desert gripped in iron silences,"
2319,SATURN,"Like a false triumph o'er contestless fates,"
2320,SATURN,Or a mirage of life in wastes of Death.
2321,SATURN,"Yet were they moved to speak, and Saturn's voice"
2322,SATURN,Seeming the soul of that tremendous land
2323,SATURN,"Set free in sound, startled the haughty stars."
2324,SATURN,
2325,SATURN,"""O Titans, gods, sustainers of the world,"
2326,SATURN,"Is this the end? Must Earth go down to Chaos,"
2327,SATURN,"Lacking our strength, beneath the unpracticed sway"
2328,SATURN,"Of godlings vain, precipitate with youth,"
2329,SATURN,"Who think, unrecking of disastrous chance,"
2330,SATURN,"To bind their will as reins upon the sun,"
2331,SATURN,Or stand as columns to the ponderous heavens?
2332,SATURN,"Must we behold, with eyes of impotence"
2333,SATURN,"That universal wrack, even though it whelm"
2334,SATURN,These our usurpers in impartial doom
2335,SATURN,Beneath the shards and fragments of the world?
2336,SATURN,"Were it not preferable to return,"
2337,SATURN,"And meeting them in fight unswervable,"
2338,SATURN,"Drag down the earth, ourselves, and these our foes,"
2339,SATURN,One sacrifice unto the gods of Chaos?
2340,SATURN,"Why should we stay, and live the tragedy"
2341,SATURN,"Of power that survives its use?"""
2342,SATURN,
2343,SATURN,Now spake
2344,SATURN,"Enceladus, when that the echoings"
2345,SATURN,"Of Saturn's voice had fled remote, and seemed"
2346,SATURN,Dead thunders caught and flung from star to star;
2347,SATURN,"""Wouldst hurl thy kingdom down the nightward gulf,"
2348,SATURN,Like to a stone a curious child might cast
2349,SATURN,To test the fall of some dark precipice?
2350,SATURN,"Patience and caution should we take as mail,"
2351,SATURN,Not rashness for a weapon--too keen sword
2352,SATURN,"That cuts the strainèd knot of destiny,"
2353,SATURN,Ne'er to be tied again. Were it not best
2354,SATURN,"To watch the slow procedure of the days,"
2355,SATURN,"That we may grasp a time more opportune,"
2356,SATURN,"When desperation is not all our strength,"
2357,SATURN,Nor the foe newly filled with victory?
2358,SATURN,Then may we hope to conquer back thy realm
2359,SATURN,"For thee, not for the gods of nothingness."""
2360,SATURN,
2361,SATURN,"He ceased, and after him no lesser god"
2362,SATURN,"Gave voice upon the shaken silences,"
2363,SATURN,"None venturing to risk comparison,"
2364,SATURN,"Inevitable then, of eloquence"
2365,SATURN,With his; but silence like the ambiguousness
2366,SATURN,Of signal and of lesser stars o'ercast
2367,SATURN,"And merged in one confusion by the moon,"
2368,SATURN,"Possessed that multitude, till Saturn rose."
2369,SATURN,"Around his form the light intensified,"
2370,SATURN,"And strengthened with addition wild and strange,"
2371,SATURN,"Investing him as with a phantom robe,"
2372,SATURN,And gathering like a crown about his brow.
2373,SATURN,"His sword, whereon the shadows lay like rust"
2374,SATURN,"He took, and dipping it within the moon,"
2375,SATURN,"Made clean its length of blade, and from it cast"
2376,SATURN,Swift flickerings at the stars. And then his voice
2377,SATURN,"Came like a torrent, and from out his eyes"
2378,SATURN,Streamed wilder power that mingled with the sound.
2379,SATURN,
2380,SATURN,*       *       *       *       *
2381,SATURN,
2382,SATURN,"And his resurgent power, in glance and word,"
2383,SATURN,"Poured through the Titans' souls, and was become"
2384,SATURN,"The fountains of their own, and at his flame"
2385,SATURN,"Their fires were lit once more, whose restlessness"
2386,SATURN,Leapt and aspired against the steadfast stars.
2387,SATURN,"And now they turned, majestic with resolve,"
2388,SATURN,"Where, red upon the forefront of the north,"
2389,SATURN,Arcturus was a beacon to the winds.
2390,SATURN,"And with the flickering winds, that lightly struck"
2391,SATURN,"The desert dust, then sprang again in air,"
2392,SATURN,They passed athwart the foreland of the north.
2393,SATURN,
2394,SATURN,"Against their march they saw the shrunken waste,"
2395,SATURN,A rivelled region like a world grown old
2396,SATURN,Whose sterile breast knew not the lips of Life
2397,SATURN,In all its epoch; or a world that was
2398,SATURN,"The nurse of infant Death, ere he became"
2399,SATURN,"Too large, too strong for its restraining arms,"
2400,SATURN,And towered athwart the suns.
2401,SATURN,
2402,SATURN,And there they crossed
2403,SATURN,"Metallic slopes that rang like monstrous shields,"
2404,SATURN,"But gave not to their tread, and clanging plains"
2405,SATURN,"Like body-mail of greater, vaster gods."
2406,SATURN,"Where hills made gibbous shadows in the moon,"
2407,SATURN,"They heard the eldritch laughters of the wind,"
2408,SATURN,Seeming the mirth of death; and 'neath their gaze
2409,SATURN,Gaunt valleys deepened like an old despair.
2410,SATURN,"Yet strode they on, through the moon's fantasies,"
2411,SATURN,"Bold with resolve, across a land like doubt."
2412,SATURN,
2413,SATURN,"And now they passed among huge mountain-bulks,"
2414,SATURN,"Themselves like peaks detached, and moving slow"
2415,SATURN,"'Mid fettered brethren, adding weight and gloom"
2416,SATURN,To that mute conclave great against the stars.
2417,SATURN,"Emerging thence, the Titans marched where still"
2418,SATURN,Their own portentous shadows went before
2419,SATURN,"Like night that fled but shrunk not, dusking all"
2420,SATURN,That desert way.
2421,SATURN,
2422,SATURN,"And thus they came where Sleep,"
2423,SATURN,"The sleep of weary victory, had seized"
2424,SATURN,"The younger gods as captives, borne beyond"
2425,SATURN,All flight of mounting battle-ecstasies
2426,SATURN,In that high triumph of forgetfulness.
2427,SATURN,"And on that sleep the striding Titans broke,"
2428,SATURN,Vague and immense at first like forming dreams
2429,SATURN,"To those disturbèd gods, in mist of drowse"
2430,SATURN,"Purblind and doubtful yet, though soon they knew"
2431,SATURN,"Their erst-defeated foes, and rising stood"
2432,SATURN,"In silent ranks expectant, that appeared"
2433,SATURN,"To move, with shaking of astonished fires"
2434,SATURN,"That bristled forth, or were displayed like plumes"
2435,SATURN,"Late folded close, now trembling terribly,"
2436,SATURN,Pending between the desert and the stars.
2437,SATURN,"Then, sudden as the waking from a dream,"
2438,SATURN,"The battle leapt, where striving shapes of gods"
2439,SATURN,"Moved brightly through the whirled and stricken air,"
2440,SATURN,Sweeping it to a froth of fire; and all
2441,SATURN,"That ancient, deep-established desert rocked,"
2442,SATURN,Shaken as by an onset of the gulfs
2443,SATURN,"Of gathered and impatient Chaos, while,"
2444,SATURN,Above the place where central battle burned
2445,SATURN,"The stars drew back in fright or dazzlement,"
2446,SATURN,Paling to more secluded distances.
2447,SATURN,"Lo, where the moon had wrought illusive dreams"
2448,SATURN,"That clothed the wild in doubt and fantasy,"
2449,SATURN,"Hiding its hideousness with bright mirage,"
2450,SATURN,"Or deepening it with gulfs and glooms of Hell,"
2451,SATURN,"Mightier confusion, chaos absolute"
2452,SATURN,"Upon the imperilled sky and trembling world,"
2453,SATURN,"Now made a certainty within itself,"
2454,SATURN,The one thing sure in shaken sky or world.
2455,SATURN,"Maelstroms of battle caught in storms of fire,"
2456,SATURN,Torn and involved by weaponry of gods--
2457,SATURN,Crescented blades that met with rounds of shields;
2458,SATURN,"Grappling of shapes, seen through the riven blaze"
2459,SATURN,"An instant, then once more obscure, and known"
2460,SATURN,Only by giant heavings of that war
2461,SATURN,"Of furious gods and roused elements,"
2462,SATURN,"Divided, leagued, contending evermore"
2463,SATURN,"Along the desert--these, augmentative"
2464,SATURN,"Round one thick center, stunned the faltering night."
2465,SATURN,
2466,SATURN,"So huge that chaos, complicate within"
2467,SATURN,"With movements of gigantic legionry,"
2468,SATURN,"Antagonistic streams, impetuous-hurled"
2469,SATURN,"Where Jove and Saturn thunder-crested, led"
2470,SATURN,In fight unswervable--so wide the strife
2471,SATURN,"Of differing impulse, that Decision found"
2472,SATURN,"No foothold, till that first confusion should"
2473,SATURN,"In ordered conflict re-arrange, and stand"
2474,SATURN,"With its true forces known. This seemed remote,"
2475,SATURN,"With that wide struggle pending terribly,"
2476,SATURN,"As if all-various, colored Time had made"
2477,SATURN,"A truce with white Eternity, and both"
2478,SATURN,Stood watching from afar.
2479,SATURN,
2480,SATURN,Through drifts of haze
2481,SATURN,"The broadening moon, made ominous with red,"
2482,SATURN,Glared from the westering night. And now that war
2483,SATURN,"Built for itself, far up, a cope of cloud,"
2484,SATURN,"And drew it down, far off, upon all sides,"
2485,SATURN,Impervious to the moon and sworded stars.
2486,SATURN,And by their own wild light the gods fought on
2487,SATURN,'Neath that stupendous concave like a sky
2488,SATURN,Filled and illumed with glare of bursting suns.
2489,SATURN,"And cast by their own light, upon that sky"
2490,SATURN,"The gods' own shadows moved like shapen gloom,"
2491,SATURN,"Phantasmagoric, changed and amplified,"
2492,SATURN,A shifting frieze that flickered dreadfully
2493,SATURN,"In spectral battle indecisive. Then,"
2494,SATURN,"Swift, as it had begun, the contest turned,"
2495,SATURN,And on the heaving Titans' massive front
2496,SATURN,It seemed that all the motion and the strength
2497,SATURN,"Self-thwarting and confounded, of that strife,"
2498,SATURN,"Was flung in centered impact terrible,"
2499,SATURN,"With rush of all that fire, tempestuous-blown"
2500,SATURN,"As if before some wind of further space,"
2501,SATURN,"Striking the earth. Lo, all the Titans' flame"
2502,SATURN,"Bent back upon themselves, and they were hurled"
2503,SATURN,"In vaster disarray, with vanguard piled"
2504,SATURN,On rear and center. Saturn could not stem
2505,SATURN,The loosened torrents of long-pent defeat;
2506,SATURN,"He, with his host, was but as drift thereon,"
2507,SATURN,Borne wildly down the whelmed and reeling world.
2508,SATURN,
2509,SATURN,"Hurling like slanted rain, the lurid levin"
2510,SATURN,"Fell o'er that flight of Titans, and behind,"
2511,SATURN,"In striding menace, all-victorious Jove"
2512,SATURN,Loomed like some craggy cloud with thunders crowned
2513,SATURN,"And footed with the winds. In that defeat,"
2514,SATURN,"With Jove's pursuit involved and manifold,"
2515,SATURN,"Few found escape unscathed, and some went down"
2516,SATURN,"Like senile suns that grapple with the dark,"
2517,SATURN,"And reel in flame tremendous, and are still."
2518,SATURN,
2519,SATURN,"Ebbing, the battle left those elder gods"
2520,SATURN,Upcast once more on coasts of black defeat--
2521,SATURN,"Gripped in despair, a vaster Tartarus."
2522,SATURN,"The victor gods, their storms and thunders spent,"
2523,SATURN,"Went dwindling northward like embattled clouds,"
2524,SATURN,"And where the lingering haze of fight dissolved,"
2525,SATURN,The pallor of the dawn began to spread
2526,SATURN,On darkness purple like the pain of Death.
2527,SATURN,"Ringed with that desolation, Saturn stood"
2528,SATURN,"Mute, and the Titans answered unto him"
2529,SATURN,"With brother silence. Motionless, they seemed"
2530,SATURN,"Some peristyle or range of columns great,"
2531,SATURN,Alone enduring of a fallen fane
2532,SATURN,In deserts of some vaster world whence Life
2533,SATURN,"And Faith have vanished long, that vaguely slips"
2534,SATURN,To an immemoried end. And twilight slow
2535,SATURN,"Crept round those lofty shapes august, and seemed"
2536,SATURN,Such as might be the faltering ghostly noon
2537,SATURN,Of mightier suns that totter down to death.
2538,SATURN,
2539,SATURN,"Then turned they, passing from that dismal place"
2540,SATURN,"Blasted anew with battle, ere the swift"
2541,SATURN,Striding of light athwart stupendous chasms
2542,SATURN,"And wasteful plains, should overtake them there,"
2543,SATURN,Bowed with too heavy a burden of defeat.
2544,SATURN,"Slowly they turned, and passed upon the west"
2545,SATURN,"Where, like a weariness immovable"
2546,SATURN,"In menace huge, the plain its monstrous bulk,"
2547,SATURN,"The peaks its hydra heads, the whole world crouched"
2548,SATURN,Against their march with the diminished stars.

2557,FINIS,"The live red flame of sunset,"
2558,FINIS,Eating the dead blue sky
2559,FINIS,"And cold insensate peaks,"
2560,FINIS,"Was loosened slowly, and fell."
2561,FINIS,"Above it, a few red stars"
2562,FINIS,Burned down like low candle-flames
2563,FINIS,Into the gaunt black sockets
2564,FINIS,Of the chill insensible mountains.
2565,FINIS,But in the ascendant skies
2566,FINIS,"(Cloudless, like some vast corpse"

2568,FINIS,Succeeded nor star nor planet.
2569,FINIS,"It may have been that black,"
2570,FINIS,"Pulseless, dead stars arose"

2572,FINIS,"But came no living orb,"
2573,FINIS,"Nor comet seeming the ghost,"
2574,FINIS,"Homeless, of an outcast world,"
2575,FINIS,Seeking its former place
2576,FINIS,That is no more nor shall be
2577,FINIS,In all the Cosmos again.
2578,FINIS,"Null, blank, and meaningless"
2579,FINIS,As a burnt scroll that blackens
2580,FINIS,"With the passing of the fire,"
2581,FINIS,Lay the dead infinite sky.
2582,FINIS,"Lo! in the halls of Time,"
2583,FINIS,"I thought, the torches are out--"
2584,FINIS,"The revelry of the gods,"
2585,FINIS,Or lamentation of demons
2586,FINIS,"For which their flames were lit,"
2587,FINIS,Over and quiet at last
2588,FINIS,"With the closing peace of night,"
