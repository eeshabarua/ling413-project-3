48,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
49,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
50,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
51,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"When 'Poetry, A Magazine of Verse', was first published in Chicago in"
52,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"the autumn of 1912, an Illinois poet, Vachel Lindsay, was, quite"
53,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"appropriately, one of its first discoveries. It may be not quite without"
54,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"significance that the issue of January, 1913, which led off with"
55,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"'General William Booth Enters into Heaven', immediately followed the"
56,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"number in which the great poet of Bengal, Rabindra Nath Tagore, was"
57,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"first presented to the American public, and that these two antipodal"
58,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,poets soon appeared in person among the earliest visitors to the editor.
59,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,For the coming together of East and West may prove to be the great event
60,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"of the approaching era, and if the poetry of the now famous Bengali"
61,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,laureate garners the richest wisdom and highest spirituality of his
62,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"ancient race, so one may venture to believe that the young Illinois"
63,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,troubadour brings from Lincoln's city an authentic strain of the lyric
64,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,message of this newer world.
65,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
66,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"It is hardly necessary, perhaps, to mention Mr. Lindsay's loyalty to the"
67,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"people of his place and hour, or the training in sympathy with their"
68,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,aims and ideals which he has achieved through vagabondish wanderings in
69,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,the Middle West.  And we may permit time to decide how far he expresses
70,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,their emotion.  But it may be opportune to emphasize his plea for poetry
71,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"as a song art, an art appealing to the ear rather than the eye.  The"
72,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,first section of this volume is especially an effort to restore poetry
73,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"to its proper place--the audience-chamber, and take it out of the"
74,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"library, the closet.  In the library it has become, so far as the people"
75,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"are concerned, almost a lost art, and perhaps it can be restored to the"
76,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,people only through a renewal of its appeal to the ear.
77,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
78,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,I am tempted to quote from Mr. Lindsay's explanatory note which
79,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,accompanied three of these poems when they were first printed in
80,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,'Poetry'.  He said:
81,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
82,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"""Mr. Yeats asked me recently in Chicago, 'What are we going to do to"
83,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,restore the primitive singing of poetry?'  I find what Mr. Yeats means
84,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,by 'the primitive singing of poetry' in Professor Edward Bliss Reed's
85,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,new volume on 'The English Lyric'.  He says in his chapter on the
86,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"definition of the lyric:  'With the Greeks ""song"" was an all-embracing"
87,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,term. It included the crooning of the nurse to the child... the
88,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,half-sung chant of the mower or sailor... the formal ode sung by the poet.
89,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"In all Greek lyrics, even in the choral odes, music was the handmaid of"
90,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,verse....  The poet himself composed the accompaniment.  Euripides was
91,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,censured because Iophon had assisted him in the musical setting of some
92,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,of his dramas.' Here is pictured a type of Greek work which survives in
93,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"American vaudeville, where every line may be two-thirds spoken and"
94,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"one-third sung, the entire rendering, musical and elocutionary, depending"
95,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,upon the improvising power and sure instinct of the performer.
96,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
97,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"""I respectfully submit these poems as experiments in which I endeavor to"
98,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,carry this vaudeville form back towards the old Greek precedent of the
99,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,half-chanted lyric.  In this case the one-third of music must be added
100,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,by the instinct of the reader.  He must be Iophon. And he can easily be
101,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,Iophon if he brings to bear upon the piece what might be called the
102,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,Higher Vaudeville imagination....
103,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
104,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"""Big general contrasts between the main sections should be the rule of"
105,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,the first attempts at improvising.  It is the hope of the writer that
106,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,after two or three readings each line will suggest its own separate
107,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,touch of melody to the reader who has become accustomed to the cadences.
108,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"Let him read what he likes read, and sing what he likes sung."""
109,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
110,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"It was during this same visit in Chicago, at 'Poetry's' banquet on the"
111,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"evening of March first, 1914, that Mr. Yeats honored Mr. Lindsay by"
112,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"addressing his after-dinner talk primarily to him as ""a fellow"
113,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"craftsman"", and by saying of 'General Booth':"
114,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
115,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"""This poem is stripped bare of ornament; it has an earnest simplicity, a"
116,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"strange beauty, and you know Bacon said, 'There is no excellent beauty"
117,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"without strangeness.'"""
118,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
119,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,This recognition from the distinguished Irish poet tempts me to hint at
120,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,the cosmopolitan aspects of such racily local art as Mr. Lindsay's. The
121,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"subject is too large for a merely introductory word, but the reader may"
122,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,be invited to reflect upon it.  If Mr. Lindsay's poetry should cross the
123,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"ocean, it would not be the first time that our most indigenous art has"
124,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"reacted upon the art of older nations. Besides Poe--who, though"
125,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"indigenous in ways too subtle for brief analysis, yet passed all"
126,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"frontiers in his swift, sad flight--the two American artists of widest"
127,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"influence, Whitman and Whistler, have been intensely American in"
128,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,temperament and in the special spiritual quality of their art.
129,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
130,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,If Whistler was the first great artist to accept the modern message in
131,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"Oriental art, if Whitman was the first great modern poet to discard the"
132,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"limitations of conventional form:  if both were more free, more"
133,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"individual, than their contemporaries, this was the expression of their"
134,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"Americanism, which may perhaps be defined as a spiritual independence"
135,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,and love of adventure inherited from the pioneers. Foreign artists are
136,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,usually the first to recognize this new tang; one detects the influence
137,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,of the great dead poet and dead painter in all modern art which looks
138,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"forward instead of back; and their countrymen, our own contemporary"
139,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"poets and painters, often express indirectly, through French influences,"
140,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,a reaction which they are reluctant to confess directly.
141,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
142,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,A lighter phase of this foreign enthusiasm for the American tang is
143,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"confessed by Signor Marinetti, the Italian ""futurist"", when in his"
144,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"article on 'Futurism and the Theatre', in 'The Mask', he urges the"
145,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"revolutionary value of ""American eccentrics"", citing the fundamental"
146,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,primitive quality in their vaudeville art. This may be another statement
147,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,of Mr. Lindsay's plea for a closer relation between the poet and his
148,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"audience, for a return to the healthier open-air conditions, and"
149,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"immediate personal contacts, in the art of the Greeks and of primitive"
150,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"nations.  Such conditions and contacts may still be found, if the world"
151,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"only knew it, in the wonderful song-dances of the Hopis and others of"
152,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"our aboriginal tribes.  They may be found, also, in a measure, in the"
153,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,quick response between artist and audience in modern vaudeville. They
154,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"are destined to a wider and higher influence; in fact, the development"
155,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"of that influence, the return to primitive sympathies between artist and"
156,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"audience, which may make possible once more the assertion of primitive"
157,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"creative power, is recognized as the immediate movement in modern art."
158,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,It is a movement strong enough to persist in spite of extravagances and
159,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"absurdities; strong enough, it may be hoped, to fulfil its purpose and"
160,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,revitalize the world.
161,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,
162,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,It is because Mr. Lindsay's poetry seems to be definitely in that
163,THE CONGO AND OTHER POEMS,"movement that it is, I think, important."

1533,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Dimly echoed still

1550,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,He wandered free to sigh
1551,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Alone in lowly friendship
1552,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,With the green grass and the sky.
1553,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,He murmured ancient music
1554,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,His red heart burned to sing
1555,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Because his perfect conquest
1556,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Had grown a weary thing.
1557,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,
1558,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,No chant of gilded triumph--
1559,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,His lonely song was made
1560,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Of Art's deliberate freedom;
1561,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Of minor chords arrayed
1562,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,In soft and shadowy colors

1572,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,Or sacred lily wrought
1573,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,In creeds and psalms and palaces

1582,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,But bloomed to prophecy
1583,BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!,"These careless, fearless harp-strings,"

2007,I,I hate this yoke; for the world's sake here put it on:
2008,I,Knowing 'twill weigh as much on you till life is gone.
2009,I,"Knowing you love your freedom dear, as I love mine--"
2010,I,Knowing that love unchained has been our life's great wine:
2011,I,"Our one great wine (yet spent too soon, and serving none;"
2012,I,Of the two cups free love at last the deadly one).
2013,I,

2020,II,"And tenderness of passion's touch, and in its room"
2021,II,"Will come tame habit, deadly calm, sorrow and gloom."
2022,II,"Oh, how the battle scars the best who enter life!"
2023,II,Each soldier comes out blind or lame from the black strife.
2024,II,Mad or diseased or damned of soul the best may come--
2025,II,"It matters not how merrily now rolls the drum,"
2026,II,"The fife shrills high, the horn sings loud, till no steps lag--"

2035,III,"It seems to flood the fields of corn, and gild the air--"
2036,III,"It seems to breathe from every brook, from flowers to sigh--"
2037,III,It seems a cataract poured down from the great sky;
2038,III,It seems a tenderness so vast no bush but shows
2039,III,Its haunting and transfiguring light where wonder glows.
2040,III,"It wraps us in a silken snare by shadowy streams,"
2041,III,And wildering sweet and stung with joy your white soul seems
2042,III,"A flame, a flame, conquering day, conquering night,"
2043,III,"Brought from our God, a holy thing, a mad delight."
2044,III,"But love, when all things beat it down, leaves the wide air,"
2045,III,"The heavens are gray, and men turn wolves, lean with despair."
2046,III,"Ah, when we need love most, and weep, when all is dark,"
2047,III,"Love is a pinch of ashes gray, with one live spark--"
2048,III,Yet on the hope to keep alive that treasure strange

2057,IV,Lest we should flash what seems disdain without disguise.
2058,IV,Yet there shall be no wavering there in that deep trial--
2059,IV,And no false fire or stranger hand or traitor vile--
2060,IV,"We'll fight the gloom and fight the world with strong sword-play,"
2061,IV,"Entrenched within our block-house small, ever at bay--"

2072,IV,Too soon you wearied of our tears.
2073,IV,"And then you danced with spangled feet,"
2074,IV,Leading Belshazzar's chattering court
2075,IV,A-tinkling through the shadowy street.
2076,IV,"With mead they came, with chants of shame."
2077,IV,DESIRE'S red flag before them flew.
2078,IV,And Istar's music moved your mouth
2079,IV,And Baal's deep shames rewoke in you.
2080,IV,
2081,IV,Now you could drive the royal car;
2082,IV,Forget our Nation's breaking load:
2083,IV,Now you could sleep on silver beds--
2084,IV,(Bitter and dark was our abode.)
2085,IV,"And so, for many a night you laughed,"
2086,IV,"And knew not of my hopeless prayer,"
2087,IV,Till God's own spirit whipped you forth
2088,IV,"From Istar's shrine, from Istar's stair."
2089,IV,
2090,IV,Darling daughter of Babylon--
2091,IV,Rose by the black Euphrates flood--
2092,IV,Again your beauty grew more dear
2093,IV,"Than my slave's bread, than my heart's blood."
2094,IV,"We sang of Zion, good to know,"
2095,IV,Where righteousness and peace abide....
2096,IV,What of your second sacrilege
2097,IV,Carousing at Belshazzar's side?
2098,IV,
2099,IV,"Once, by a stream, we clasped tired hands--"
2100,IV,Your paint and henna washed away.
2101,IV,"Your place, you said, was with the slaves"
2102,IV,"Who sewed the thick cloth, night and day."
2103,IV,You were a pale and holy maid
2104,IV,Toil-bound with us.  One night you said:--
2105,IV,"""Your God shall be my God until"
2106,IV,"I slumber with the patriarch dead."""
2107,IV,
2108,IV,"Pardon, daughter of Babylon,"
2109,IV,"If, on this night remembering"
2110,IV,Our lover walks under the walls
2111,IV,"Of hanging gardens in the spring,"
2112,IV,"A venom comes from broken hope,"
2113,IV,From memories of your comrade-song
2114,IV,Until I curse your painted eyes

2126,IV,And the tremendous Amaranth descends
2127,IV,Sweet with the glory of ten thousand dawns?
2128,IV,
2129,IV,Does it not mean my God would have me say:--
2130,IV,"""Whether you will or no, O city young,"
2131,IV,"Heaven will bloom like one great flower for you,"
2132,IV,"Flash and loom greatly all your marts among?"""

2137,IV,"Though our strong youths are strident now, or dumb."

2152,IV,"Like a white statue dropped into the deep,"
2153,IV,"Covered with sand, covered with chests of gold,"
2154,IV,"And slave-bones, tossed from many a pirate hold."
2155,IV,
2156,IV,But for this prayer thou wilt not bind in Hell
2157,IV,"My soul, that shook with love for Fame and Truth--"
2158,IV,In such unquenched desires consumed his youth--
2159,IV,"Let me turn dust, like dead leaves in the Fall,"

2178,I,That passed and left me in the sun's bright rays.
2179,I,Now though you go on smiling in the sun
2180,I,"Our love is slain, and love and you were one."
2181,I,"You are the first, you I have known so long,"
2182,I,"Whose death was deadly, a tremendous wrong."
2183,I,Therefore I seek the faith that sets it right
2184,I,Amid the lilies and the candle-light.

2186,I,"We two may meet, confused and parted here."

2780,II,
2781,II,They had the waiters whirling round
2782,II,Just sweeping up the smear and smash.
2783,II,They tried to buy the State-house flag.
2784,II,They showed the Janitor the cash.

2941,II,Some folks... are... deadly... slow.
2942,II,"Twelve snails went walking yestereve,"
2943,II,Led by their fat old king.
2944,II,They were so dull their princeling had
2945,II,"No sceptre, robe or ring--"
2946,II,Only a paper cap to wear
2947,II,When nightly journeying.

2965,II,He sits upon his hill and cries
2966,II,For fear that _I_ will bite.
2967,II,
2968,II,The sun's a broncho.  He's afraid
2969,II,"Like every other thing,"
2970,II,"And trembles, morning, noon and night,"

3000,II,"A sparkle through the pane,"
3001,II,Showing the place is brighter still
3002,II,"Within, though bright without."
3003,II,"There, at a cosy open fire"
3004,II,Strange babes are grouped about.
3005,II,The children of the wind and tide--

3016,II,Whose song the fays hold dear.
3017,II,"Of course you do not hear it, child."
3018,II,It takes a FAIRY ear.
3019,II,
3020,II,The full moon is a splendid gong
3021,II,That beats as night grows still.

3023,II,Of dove or whippoorwill.

3032,II,"The moon?  It is a griffin's egg,"
3033,II,Hatching to-morrow night.
3034,II,And how the little boys will watch
3035,II,With shouting and delight
3036,II,To see him break the shell and stretch
3037,II,And creep across the sky.
3038,II,"The boys will laugh.  The little girls,"
3039,II,"I fear, may hide and cry."
3040,II,"Yet gentle will the griffin be,"
3041,II,"Most decorous and fat,"
3042,II,And walk up to the milky way
3043,II,And lap it like a cat.

3052,II,I.  Prologue.  A Sense of Humor
3053,II,
3054,II,
3055,II,No man should stand before the moon
3056,II,"To make sweet song thereon,"
3057,II,"With dandified importance,"
3058,II,His sense of humor gone.
3059,II,
3060,II,"Nay, let us don the motley cap,"
3061,II,"The jester's chastened mien,"
3062,II,If we would woo that looking-glass
3063,II,And see what should be seen.
3064,II,
3065,II,"O mirror on fair Heaven's wall,"
3066,II,We find there what we bring.
3067,II,"So, let us smile in honest part"
3068,II,And deck our souls and sing.
3069,II,
3070,II,"Yea, by the chastened jest alone"
3071,II,"Will ghosts and terrors pass,"
3072,II,"And fays, or suchlike friendly things,"
3073,II,Throw kisses through the glass.

3076,II,
3077,II,II.  On the Garden-wall
3078,II,
3079,II,
3080,II,"Oh, once I walked a garden"
3081,II,In dreams.  'Twas yellow grass.
3082,II,And many orange-trees grew there
3083,II,In sand as white as glass.
3084,II,"The curving, wide wall-border"
3085,II,"Was marble, like the snow."
3086,II,I walked that wall a fairy-prince
3087,II,"And, pacing quaint and slow,"
3088,II,"Beside me were my pages,"
3089,II,"Two giant, friendly birds."
3090,II,"Half-swan they were, half peacock."
3091,II,They spake in courtier-words.
3092,II,"Their inner wings a chariot,"
3093,II,"Their outer wings for flight,"
3094,II,They lifted me from dreamland.
3095,II,We bade those trees good-night.
3096,II,Swiftly above the stars we rode.
3097,II,I looked below me soon.
3098,II,The white-walled garden I had ruled
3099,II,Was one lone flower--the moon.

3103,II,III.  Written for a Musician
3104,II,
3105,II,
3106,II,Hungry for music with a desperate hunger
3107,II,"I prowled abroad, I threaded through the town;"
3108,II,"The evening crowd was clamoring and drinking,"
3109,II,Vulgar and pitiful--my heart bowed down--
3110,II,Till I remembered duller hours made noble
3111,II,By strangers clad in some surprising grace.
3112,II,"Wait, wait, my soul, your music comes ere midnight"
3113,II,Appearing in some unexpected place
3114,II,"With quivering lips, and gleaming, moonlit face."

3119,II,
3120,II,
3121,II,He coveted her portrait.
3122,II,He toiled as she grew gay.
3123,II,She loved to see him labor
3124,II,In that devoted way.
3125,II,
3126,II,"And in the end it pleased her,"
3127,II,But bowed him more with care.
3128,II,"Her rose-smile showed so plainly,"
3129,II,Her soul-smile was not there.
3130,II,
3131,II,That night he groped without a lamp
3132,II,"To find a cloak, a book,"
3133,II,And on the vexing portrait
3134,II,By moonrise chanced to look.
3135,II,
3136,II,"The color-scheme was out of key,"
3137,II,"The maiden rose-smile faint,"
3138,II,But through the blessed darkness
3139,II,"She gleamed, his friendly saint."
3140,II,
3141,II,"The comrade, white, immortal,"
3142,II,"His bride, and more than bride--"
3143,II,"The citizen, the sage of mind,"
3144,II,For whom he lived and died.

3163,II,
3164,II,
3165,II,"The moon's a brass-hooped water-keg,"
3166,II,A wondrous water-feast.
3167,II,If I could climb the ridge and drink
3168,II,And give drink to my beast;
3169,II,"If I could drain that keg, the flies"
3170,II,"Would not be biting so,"
3171,II,"My burning feet be spry again,"
3172,II,My mule no longer slow.
3173,II,"And I could rise and dig for ore,"
3174,II,"And reach my fatherland,"
3175,II,And not be food for ants and hawks
3176,II,And perish in the sand.

3179,II,

3181,II,
3182,II,
3183,II,The moon's an open furnace door
3184,II,"Where all can see the blast,"
3185,II,"We shovel in our blackest griefs,"
3186,II,Upon that grate are cast
3187,II,"Our aching burdens, loves and fears"
3188,II,And underneath them wait
3189,II,Paper and tar and pitch and pine
3190,II,Called strife and blood and hate.
3191,II,
3192,II,"Out of it all there comes a flame,"
3193,II,A splendid widening light.
3194,II,Sorrow is turned to mystery
3195,II,And Death into delight.

3200,II,
3201,II,
3202,II,Two statesmen met by moonlight.
3203,II,Their ease was partly feigned.
3204,II,They glanced about the prairie.
3205,II,Their faces were constrained.
3206,II,In various ways aforetime
3207,II,"They had misled the state,"
3208,II,Yet did it so politely
3209,II,Their henchmen thought them great.
3210,II,They sat beneath a hedge and spake
3211,II,"No word, but had a smoke."
3212,II,A satchel passed from hand to hand.
3213,II,"Next day, the deadlock broke."
3214,II,

3216,II,
3217,II,IX.  What Semiramis Said
3218,II,
3219,II,
3220,II,The moon's a steaming chalice
3221,II,Of honey and venom-wine.
3222,II,A little of it sipped by night
3223,II,Makes the long hours divine.
3224,II,"But oh, my reckless lovers,"
3225,II,"They drain the cup and wail,"
3226,II,Die at my feet with shaking limbs
3227,II,And tender lips all pale.
3228,II,Above them in the sky it bends
3229,II,Empty and gray and dread.
3230,II,"To-morrow night 'tis full again,"
3231,II,"Golden, and foaming red."

3236,II,
3237,II,
3238,II,"Where now the huts are empty,"
3239,II,"Where never a camp-fire glows,"
3240,II,"In an abandoned canyon,"
3241,II,A Gambler's Ghost arose.
3242,II,"He muttered there, ""The moon's a sack"
3243,II,"Of dust.""  His voice rose thin:"
3244,II,"""I wish I knew the miner-man."
3245,II,"I'd play, and play to win."
3246,II,In every game in Cripple-creek
3247,II,"Of old, when stakes were high,"
3248,II,I held my own.  Now I would play
3249,II,For that sack in the sky.
3250,II,The sport would not be ended there.
3251,II,'Twould rather be begun.

3259,II,
3260,II,This is the song

3264,II,Sky-born Beauty--
3265,II,"Spice of desire,"""
3266,II,Under the spice-tree
3267,II,"Watch and wait,"
3268,II,Burning maidens
3269,II,And lads that mate.
3270,II,
3271,II,The spice-tree spreads
3272,II,And its boughs come down
3273,II,Shadowing village and farm and town.
3274,II,And none can see
3275,II,But the pure of heart
3276,II,The great green leaves
3277,II,"And the boughs descending,"
3278,II,And hear the song that is never ending.
3279,II,
3280,II,"The deep roots whisper,"
3281,II,The branches say:--
3282,II,"""Love to-morrow,"
3283,II,"And love to-day,"
3284,II,"And till Heaven's day,"
3285,II,"And till Heaven's day."""
3286,II,
3287,II,"The moon is a bird's nest in its branches,"
3288,II,The moon is hung in its topmost spaces.
3289,II,"And there, to-night, two doves play house"
3290,II,While lovers watch with uplifted faces.
3291,II,Two doves go home
3292,II,"To their nest, the moon."
3293,II,"It is woven of twigs of broken light,"
3294,II,With threads of scarlet and threads of gray
3295,II,And a lining of down for silk delight.
3296,II,"To their Eden, the moon, fly home our doves,"
3297,II,Up through the boughs of the great spice-tree;--
3298,II,"And one is the kiss I took from you,"

3304,II,
3305,II,(What the Tramp Said)
3306,II,
3307,II,
3308,II,The old man had his box and wheel
3309,II,For grinding knives and shears.
3310,II,No doubt his bell in village streets
3311,II,Was joy to children's ears.
3312,II,And I bethought me of my youth
3313,II,"When such men came around,"
3314,II,"And times I asked them in, quite sure"
3315,II,The scissors should be ground.
3316,II,"The old man turned and spoke to me,"
3317,II,His face at last in view.
3318,II,And then I thought those curious eyes
3319,II,Were eyes that once I knew.
3320,II,
3321,II,"""The moon is but an emery-wheel"
3322,II,"To whet the sword of God,"""
3323,II,"He said.  ""And here beside my fire"
3324,II,I stretch upon the sod
3325,II,"Each night, and dream, and watch the stars"
3326,II,And watch the ghost-clouds go.
3327,II,And see that sword of God in Heaven
3328,II,A-waving to and fro.
3329,II,"I see that sword each century, friend."
3330,II,It means the world-war comes
3331,II,"With all its bloody, wicked chiefs"
3332,II,And hate-inflaming drums.
3333,II,"Men talk of peace, but I have seen"
3334,II,That emery-wheel turn round.
3335,II,The voice of Abel cries again
3336,II,To God from out the ground.
3337,II,"The ditches must flow red, the plague"
3338,II,Go stark and screaming by
3339,II,Each time that sword of God takes edge
3340,II,Within the midnight sky.
3341,II,And those that scorned their brothers here
3342,II,And sowed a wind of shame
3343,II,Will reap the whirlwind as of old
3344,II,"And face relentless flame."""
3345,II,
3346,II,"And thus the scissors-grinder spoke,"
3347,II,His face at last in view.
3348,II,_And there beside the railroad bridge
3349,II,I saw the wandering Jew_.

3352,II,
3353,II,XIII.  My Lady in her White Silk Shawl
3354,II,
3355,II,
3356,II,My lady in her white silk shawl
3357,II,"Is like a lily dim,"
3358,II,Within the twilight of the room
3359,II,Enthroned and kind and prim.
3360,II,
3361,II,My lady!  Pale gold is her hair.
3362,II,Until she smiles her face
3363,II,"Is pale with far Hellenic moods,"
3364,II,With thoughts that find no place
3365,II,
3366,II,In our harsh village of the West
3367,II,"Wherein she lives of late,"
3368,II,"She's distant as far-hidden stars,"
3369,II,And cold--(almost!)--as fate.
3370,II,
3371,II,But when she smiles she's here again
3372,II,"Rosy with comrade-cheer,"
3373,II,A Puritan Bacchante made
3374,II,To laugh around the year.
3375,II,

3387,II,"""This tailor-shop sings not at all."
3388,II,"Chant me a word of the twilight,"
3389,II,Of roses that mourn in the fall.
3390,II,Bring me a song like hashish
3391,II,"That will comfort the stale and the sad,"
3392,II,"For I would be mending my spirit,"
3393,II,"Forgetting these days that are bad,"
3394,II,"Forgetting companions too shallow,"
3395,II,"Their quarrels and arguments thin,"
3396,II,"Forgetting the shouting Muezzin:""--"

3398,II,
3399,II,"""Bring me old wines,"" said Aladdin."
3400,II,"""I have been a starved pauper too long."
3401,II,"Serve them in vessels of jade and of shell,"
3402,II,Serve them with fruit and with song:--
3403,II,Wines of pre-Adamite Sultans
3404,II,Digged from beneath the black seas:--
3405,II,New-gathered dew from the heavens
3406,II,"Dripped down from Heaven's sweet trees,"
3407,II,Cups from the angels' pale tables
3408,II,"That will make me both handsome and wise,"
3409,II,"For I have beheld her, the princess,"
3410,II,Firelight and starlight her eyes.
3411,II,"Pauper I am, I would woo her."
3412,II,"And--let me drink wine, to begin,"
3413,II,"Though the Koran expressly forbids it."""
3414,II,"""I AM YOUR SLAVE,"" said the Jinn."
3415,II,
3416,II,"""Plan me a dome,"" said Aladdin,"
3417,II,"""That is drawn like the dawn of the MOON,"

3420,II,"""Build me a dome,"" said Aladdin,"
3421,II,"""That shall cause all young lovers to sigh,"
3422,II,"The fullness of life and of beauty,"
3423,II,Peace beyond peace to the eye--
3424,II,"A palace of foam and of opal,"

3435,II,
3436,II,"The moon's a monk, unmated,"
3437,II,"Who walks his cell, the sky."
3438,II,His strength is that of heaven-vowed men
3439,II,Who all life's flames defy.
3440,II,
3441,II,"They turn to stars or shadows,"
3442,II,They go like snow or dew--
3443,II,Leaving behind no sorrow--
3444,II,Only the arching blue.

3458,II,
3459,II,"(In Springfield, Illinois)"
3460,II,
3461,II,
3462,II,
3463,II,"It is portentous, and a thing of state"
3464,II,"That here at midnight, in our little town"
3465,II,"A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,"
3466,II,"Near the old court-house pacing up and down,"
3467,II,
3468,II,"Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards"
3469,II,"He lingers where his children used to play,"
3470,II,"Or through the market, on the well-worn stones"
3471,II,He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.
3472,II,
3473,II,"A bronzed, lank man!  His suit of ancient black,"
3474,II,A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl
3475,II,"Make him the quaint great figure that men love,"
3476,II,"The prairie-lawyer, master of us all."
3477,II,
3478,II,He cannot sleep upon his hillside now.
3479,II,He is among us:--as in times before!
3480,II,And we who toss and lie awake for long
3481,II,"Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door."
3482,II,
3483,II,His head is bowed.  He thinks on men and kings.
3484,II,"Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?"
3485,II,"Too many peasants fight, they know not why,"
3486,II,Too many homesteads in black terror weep.
3487,II,
3488,II,The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.
3489,II,He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.
3490,II,He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now
3491,II,"The bitterness, the folly and the pain."
3492,II,
3493,II,He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn
3494,II,Shall come;--the shining hope of Europe free:
3495,II,"The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,"
3496,II,"Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea."
3497,II,
3498,II,"It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,"
3499,II,That all his hours of travail here for men
3500,II,Seem yet in vain.  And who will bring white peace
3501,II,That he may sleep upon his hill again?

3507,II,
3508,II,
3509,II,
3510,II,"A curse upon each king who leads his state,"
3511,II,"No matter what his plea, to this foul game,"
3512,II,"And may it end his wicked dynasty,"
3513,II,And may he die in exile and black shame.
3514,II,
3515,II,"If there is vengeance in the Heaven of Heavens,"
3516,II,What punishment could Heaven devise for these
3517,II,"Who fill the rivers of the world with dead,"
3518,II,And turn their murderers loose on all the seas!
3519,II,
3520,II,"Put back the clock of time a thousand years,"
3521,II,"And make our Europe, once the world's proud Queen,"
3522,II,"A shrieking strumpet, furious fratricide,"
3523,II,"Eater of entrails, wallowing obscene"
3524,II,
3525,II,"In pits where millions foam and rave and bark,"
3526,II,"Mad dogs and idiots, thrice drunk with strife;"
3527,II,"While Science towers above;--a witch, red-winged:"
3528,II,Science we looked to for the light of life.
3529,II,
3530,II,"Curse me the men who make and sell iron ships,"
3531,II,"Who walk the floor in thought, that they may find"
3532,II,"Each powder prompt, each steel with fearful edge,"
3533,II,Each deadliest device against mankind.
3534,II,
3535,II,"Curse me the sleek lords with their plumes and spurs,"
3536,II,"May Heaven give their land to peasant spades,"
3537,II,"Give them the brand of Cain, for their pride's sake,"
3538,II,And felon's stripes for medals and for braids.
3539,II,
3540,II,"Curse me the fiddling, twiddling diplomats,"
3541,II,"Haggling here, plotting and hatching there,"
3542,II,"Who make the kind world but their game of cards,"
3543,II,Till millions die at turning of a hair.
3544,II,
3545,II,What punishment will Heaven devise for these
3546,II,"Who win by others' sweat and hardihood,"
3547,II,"Who make men into stinking vultures' meat,"
3548,II,"Saying to evil still ""Be thou my good""?"
3549,II,
3550,II,"Ah, he who starts a million souls toward death"
3551,II,Should burn in utmost hell a million years!
3552,II,--Mothers of men go on the destined wrack
3553,II,"To give them life, with anguish and with tears:--"
3554,II,
3555,II,Are all those childbed sorrows sneered away?
3556,II,"Yea, fools laugh at the humble christenings,"
3557,II,And cradle-joys are mocked of the fat lords:
3558,II,These mothers' sons made dead men for the Kings!
3559,II,
3560,II,"All in the name of this or that grim flag,"
3561,II,No angel-flags in all the rag-array--
3562,II,"Banners the demons love, and all Hell sings"
3563,II,And plays wild harps.  Those flags march forth to-day!

3570,II,
3571,II,
3572,II,They say one king is mad.  Perhaps.  Who knows?
3573,II,They say one king is doddering and grey.
3574,II,"They say one king is slack and sick of mind,"
3575,II,A puppet for hid strings that twitch and play.
3576,II,
3577,II,Is Europe then to be their sprawling-place?
3578,II,"Their mad-house, till it turns the wide world's bane?"
3579,II,"Their place of maudlin, slavering conference"
3580,II,Till every far-off farmstead goes insane?

3589,II,"Awake again in Asia, Lord of Peace,"
3590,II,"Awake and preach, for her far swordsmen rise."
3591,II,"And would they sheathe the sword before you, friend,"
3592,II,"Or scorn your way, while looking in your eyes?"
3593,II,
3594,II,"Good comrade and philosopher and prince,"
3595,II,"Thoughtful and thoroughbred and strong and kind,"
3596,II,"Dare they to move against your pride benign,"
3597,II,"Lord of the Law, high chieftain of the mind?"
3598,II,
3599,II,*****
3600,II,
3601,II,"But what can Europe say, when in your name"

3610,II,
3611,II,
3612,II,
3613,II,This is the sin against the Holy Ghost:--
3614,II,"To speak of bloody power as right divine,"
3615,II,"And call on God to guard each vile chief's house,"
3616,II,"And for such chiefs, turn men to wolves and swine:--"
3617,II,
3618,II,"To go forth killing in White Mercy's name,"
3619,II,"Making the trenches stink with spattered brains,"
3620,II,"Tearing the nerves and arteries apart,"
3621,II,Sowing with flesh the unreaped golden plains.
3622,II,
3623,II,"In any Church's name, to sack fair towns,"
3624,II,"And turn each home into a screaming sty,"
3625,II,"To make the little children fugitive,"
3626,II,"And have their mothers for a quick death cry,--"
3627,II,
3628,II,This is the sin against the Holy Ghost:
3629,II,This is the sin no purging can atone:--
3630,II,To send forth rapine in the name of Christ:--
3631,II,"To set the face, and make the heart a stone."

3640,II,"St. Francis, Buddha, Tolstoi, and St. John--"
3641,II,"Friends, if you four, as pilgrims, hand in hand,"
3642,II,"Returned, the hate of earth once more to dare,"
3643,II,"And walked upon the water and the land,"
3644,II,
3645,II,"If you, with words celestial, stopped these kings"
3646,II,"For sober conclave, ere their battle great,"
3647,II,Would they for one deep instant then discern
3648,II,"Their crime, their heart-rot, and their fiend's estate?"
3649,II,
3650,II,"If you should float above the battle's front,"
3651,II,"Pillars of cloud, of fire that does not slay,"
3652,II,"Bearing a fifth within your regal train,"
3653,II,The Son of David in his strange array--
3654,II,
3655,II,"If, in his majesty, he towered toward Heaven,"

3666,II,
3667,II,"Though I have found you like a snow-drop pale,"
3668,II,"On sunny days have found you weak and still,"
3669,II,Though I have often held your girlish head
3670,II,"Drooped on my shoulder, faint from little ill:--"
3671,II,
3672,II,Under the blessing of your Psyche-wings
3673,II,"I hide to-night like one small broken bird,"
3674,II,So soothed I half-forget the world gone mad:--
3675,II,And all the winds of war are now unheard.
3676,II,
3677,II,My heaven-doubting pennons feel your hands
3678,II,"With touch most delicate so circling round,"
3679,II,That for an hour I dream that God is good.
3680,II,"And in your shadow, Mercy's ways abound."
3681,II,
3682,II,"I thought myself the guard of your frail state,"
3683,II,"And yet I come to-night a helpless guest,"
3684,II,"Hiding beneath your giant Psyche-wings,"
3685,II,Against the pallor of your wondrous breast.
