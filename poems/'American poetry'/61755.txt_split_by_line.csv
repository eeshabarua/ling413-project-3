69,O. HENRY,"Blow give for blow in the foray,"

84,O. HENRY,
85,O. HENRY,Good when the bugles are ranting
86,O. HENRY,It is to be iron and fire;
87,O. HENRY,"Good to be oak in the foray,"
88,O. HENRY,Ice to a guilty desire.
89,O. HENRY,But when the battle is over
90,O. HENRY,(Marvel and wonder the while)
91,O. HENRY,Give to a woman a woman's

96,O. HENRY,A Lunar Episode
97,O. HENRY,
98,O. HENRY,"The scene was one of supernatural weirdness. Tall, fantastic mountains"
99,O. HENRY,reared their seamed peaks over a dreary waste of igneous rock and
100,O. HENRY,burned-out lava beds. Deep lakes of black water stood motionless as
101,O. HENRY,"glass under frowning, honeycombed crags, from which ever and anon"
102,O. HENRY,dropped crumbled masses with a sullen plunge. Vegetation there was
103,O. HENRY,none. Bitter cold reigned and ridges of black and shapeless rocks cut
104,O. HENRY,the horizon on all sides. An extinct volcano loomed against a purple
105,O. HENRY,"sky, black as night and old as the world."
106,O. HENRY,
107,O. HENRY,The firmament was studded with immense stars that shone with a wan and
108,O. HENRY,spectral light. Orion's belt hung high above.
109,O. HENRY,
110,O. HENRY,"Aldebaran faintly shone millions of miles away, and the earth gleamed"
111,O. HENRY,"like a new-risen moon with a lurid, blood-like glow."
112,O. HENRY,
113,O. HENRY,On a lofty mountain that hung toppling above an ink-black sea stood a
114,O. HENRY,dwelling built of stone. From its solitary window came a bright light
115,O. HENRY,that gleamed upon the misshapen rocks. The door opened and two men
116,O. HENRY,emerged locked in a deadly struggle.
117,O. HENRY,
118,O. HENRY,"They swayed and twisted upon the edge of the precipice, now one"
119,O. HENRY,"gaining the advantage, now the other."
120,O. HENRY,
121,O. HENRY,"Strong men they were, and stone rolled from their feet into the valley"
122,O. HENRY,as each strove to overcome the other.
123,O. HENRY,
124,O. HENRY,"At length one prevailed. He seized his opponent, and raising him high"
125,O. HENRY,"above his head, hurled him into space."
126,O. HENRY,
127,O. HENRY,The vanquished combatant shot through the air like a stone from a
128,O. HENRY,catapult in the direction of the luminous earth.
129,O. HENRY,
130,O. HENRY,"""That's three of 'em this week,"" said the Man in the Moon as he lit a"
131,O. HENRY,"cigarette and turned back into the house. ""Those New York interviewers"
132,O. HENRY,"are going to make me tired if they keep this thing up much longer."""
133,O. HENRY,
134,O. HENRY,
135,O. HENRY,
136,O. HENRY,Three Paragraphs
137,O. HENRY,
138,O. HENRY,"""Copy,"" yelled the small boy at the door. The sick woman lying on the"
139,O. HENRY,bed began to move her fingers aimlessly upon the worn counterpane. Her
140,O. HENRY,"eyes were bright with fever; her face, once beautiful, was thin and"
141,O. HENRY,"pain drawn. She was dying, but neither she nor the man who held her"
142,O. HENRY,hand and wrote on a paper tablet knew that the end was so near.
143,O. HENRY,
144,O. HENRY,Three paragraphs were lacking to fill the column of humorous matter
145,O. HENRY,that the foreman had sent for. The small pay it brought them barely
146,O. HENRY,furnished shelter and food. Medicine was lacking but the need for that
147,O. HENRY,was nearly over.
148,O. HENRY,
149,O. HENRY,"The woman's mind was wandering; she spoke quickly and unceasingly, and"
150,O. HENRY,"the man bit his pencil and stared at the pad of paper, holding her"
151,O. HENRY,"slim, hot hand."
152,O. HENRY,
153,O. HENRY,"""Oh, Jack; Jack, papa says no, I cannot go with you. Not love you!"
154,O. HENRY,"Jack, do you want to break my heart? Oh, look, look! the fields are"
155,O. HENRY,"like heaven, so filled with flowers. Why have you no ice? I had ice"
156,O. HENRY,"when I was at home. Can't you give me just a little piece, my throat"
157,O. HENRY,"is burning?"""
158,O. HENRY,
159,O. HENRY,"The humourist wrote: ""When a man puts a piece of ice down a girl's"
160,O. HENRY,"back at a picnic, does he give her the cold shoulder?"""
161,O. HENRY,
162,O. HENRY,The woman feverishly put back the loose masses of brown hair from her
163,O. HENRY,burning face.
164,O. HENRY,
165,O. HENRY,"""Jack, Jack, I don't want to die! Who is that climbing in the window?"
166,O. HENRY,"Oh, it's only Jack, and here is Jack holding my hand, too. How funny!"
167,O. HENRY,"We are going to the river tonight. The quiet, broad, dark, whispering"
168,O. HENRY,"river. Hold my hand tight. Jack, I can feel the water coming in. It is"
169,O. HENRY,"so cold. How queer it seems to be dead, dead, and see the trees above"
170,O. HENRY,"you."""
171,O. HENRY,
172,O. HENRY,"The humourist wrote: ""On the dead square--a cemetery lot."""
173,O. HENRY,
174,O. HENRY,"""Copy, sir,"" yelled the small boy again. ""Forms locked in half an"
175,O. HENRY,"hour."""
176,O. HENRY,
177,O. HENRY,The man bit his pencil into splinters. The hand he held was growing
178,O. HENRY,"cooler; surely her fever must be leaving. She was singing now, a"
179,O. HENRY,"little crooning song she might have learned at her mother's knee, and"
180,O. HENRY,her fingers had ceased moving.
181,O. HENRY,
182,O. HENRY,"""They told me,"" she said weakly and sadly, ""that hardships and"
183,O. HENRY,suffering would come upon me for disobeying my parents and marrying
184,O. HENRY,"Jack. Oh, dear, my head aches so I can't think. No, no, the white"
185,O. HENRY,"dress with the lace sleeves, not that black, dreadful thing! Sailing,"
186,O. HENRY,"sailing, sailing, where does this river go? You are not Jack, you are"
187,O. HENRY,"too cold and stern. What is that red mark on your brow? Come, sister,"
188,O. HENRY,"let's make some daisy chains and then hurry home, there is a great"
189,O. HENRY,"black cloud above us--I'll be better in the morning. Jack, if you'll"
190,O. HENRY,"hold my hand tight. Jack, I feel as light as a feather--I'm just"
191,O. HENRY,"floating, floating, right into the cloud and I can't feel your hand."
192,O. HENRY,"Oh, I see her now, and there is the old love and tenderness in her"
193,O. HENRY,"face. I must go to her. Jack. Mother, mother!"""
194,O. HENRY,
195,O. HENRY,The man wrote quickly:
196,O. HENRY,
197,O. HENRY,"""A woman generally likes her husband's mother-in-law the best of all"
198,O. HENRY,"his relatives."""
199,O. HENRY,
200,O. HENRY,"Then he sprang to the door, dashed the column of copy into the boy's"
201,O. HENRY,"hand, and moved swiftly to the bed."
202,O. HENRY,
203,O. HENRY,"He put his arm softly under the brown head that had suffered so much,"
204,O. HENRY,but it turned heavily aside.
205,O. HENRY,
206,O. HENRY,The fever was gone. The humourist was alone.
207,O. HENRY,
208,O. HENRY,
209,O. HENRY,
210,O. HENRY,Bulger's Friend
211,O. HENRY,
212,O. HENRY,It was rare sport for a certain element in the town when old Bulger
213,O. HENRY,"joined the Salvation Army. Bulger was the town's odd ""character,"" a"
214,O. HENRY,"shiftless, eccentric old man, and a natural foe to social conventions."
215,O. HENRY,"He lived on the bank of a brook that bisected the town, in a wonderful"
216,O. HENRY,"hut of his own contriving, made of scrap lumber, clapboards, pieces of"
217,O. HENRY,"tin, canvas and corrugated iron."
218,O. HENRY,
219,O. HENRY,The most adventurous boys circled Bulger's residence at a respectful
220,O. HENRY,"distance. He was intolerant of visitors, and repelled the curious with"
221,O. HENRY,"belligerent and gruff inhospitality. In return, the report was current"
222,O. HENRY,"that he was of unsound mind, something of a wizard, and a miser with a"
223,O. HENRY,vast amount of gold buried in or near his hut. The old man worked at
224,O. HENRY,"odd jobs, such as weeding gardens and whitewashing; and he collected"
225,O. HENRY,"old bones, scrap metal and bottles from alleys and yards."
226,O. HENRY,
227,O. HENRY,One rainy night when the Salvation Army was holding a slenderly
228,O. HENRY,"attended meeting in its hall, Bulger had appeared and asked permission"
229,O. HENRY,to join the ranks. The sergeant in command of the post welcomed the
230,O. HENRY,old man with that cheerful lack of prejudice that distinguishes the
231,O. HENRY,peaceful militants of his order.
232,O. HENRY,
233,O. HENRY,"Bulger was at once assigned to the position of bass drummer, to his"
234,O. HENRY,"evident, although grimly expressed, joy. Possibly the sergeant, who"
235,O. HENRY,"had the success of his command at heart, perceived that it would be no"
236,O. HENRY,mean token of successful warfare to have the new recruit thus
237,O. HENRY,"prominently displayed, representing, as he did, if not a brand from"
238,O. HENRY,"the burning, at least a well-charred and sap-dried chunk."
239,O. HENRY,
240,O. HENRY,"So every night, when the Army marched from its quarters to the street"
241,O. HENRY,"corner where open-air services were held, Bulger stumbled along with"
242,O. HENRY,"his bass drum behind the sergeant and the corporal, who played ""Sweet"
243,O. HENRY,"By and By"" and ""Only an Armor-Bearer"" in unison upon their cornets."
244,O. HENRY,And never before in that town was bass drum so soundly whacked. Bulger
245,O. HENRY,"managed to keep time with the cornets upon his instrument, but his"
246,O. HENRY,feet were always wo-fully unrhythmic. He shuffled and staggered and
247,O. HENRY,rocked from side to side like a bear.
248,O. HENRY,
249,O. HENRY,"Truly, he was not pleasing to the sight. He was a bent, ungainly old"
250,O. HENRY,"man, with a face screwed to one side and wrinkled like a dry prune."
251,O. HENRY,"The red shirt, which proclaimed his enlistment into the ranks, was a"
252,O. HENRY,"misfit, being the outer husk of a leviathan corporal who had died some"
253,O. HENRY,time before. This garment hung upon Bulger in folds. His old brown cap
254,O. HENRY,was always pulled down over one eye. These and his wabbling gait gave
255,O. HENRY,"him the appearance of some great simian, captured and imperfectly"
256,O. HENRY,educated in pedestrian and musical manoeuvres.
257,O. HENRY,
258,O. HENRY,The thoughtless boys and undeveloped men who gathered about the street
259,O. HENRY,services of the Army badgered Bulger incessantly. They called upon him
260,O. HENRY,"to give oral testimony to his conversion, and criticized the technique"
261,O. HENRY,and style of his drum performance. But the old man paid no attention
262,O. HENRY,"whatever to their jeers. He rarely spoke to anyone except when, on"
263,O. HENRY,"coming and going, he gruffly saluted his comrades."
264,O. HENRY,
265,O. HENRY,"The sergeant had met many odd characters, and knew how to study them."
266,O. HENRY,He allowed the recruit to have his own silent way for a time. Every
267,O. HENRY,"evening Bulger appeared at the hall, marched up the street with the"
268,O. HENRY,squad and back again. Then he would place his drum in the comer where
269,O. HENRY,"it belonged, and sit upon the last bench in the rear until the hall"
270,O. HENRY,meeting was concluded.
271,O. HENRY,
272,O. HENRY,"But one night the sergeant followed the old man outside, and laid his"
273,O. HENRY,"hand upon his shoulder. ""Comrade,"" he said, ""is it well with you?"""
274,O. HENRY,
275,O. HENRY,"""Not yet, sergeant,"" said Bulger. ""I'm only tryin.' I'm glad you come"
276,O. HENRY,outside. I've been wantin' to ask you: Do you believe the Lord would
277,O. HENRY,"take a man in if he come to Him late like--kind of a last resort, you"
278,O. HENRY,know? Say a man who'd lost everything--home and property and friends
279,O. HENRY,"and health. Wouldn't it look mean to wait till then and try to come?"""
280,O. HENRY,
281,O. HENRY,"""Bless His name--no!"" said the sergeant. ""Come ye that are heavy"
282,O. HENRY,"laden; that's what He says. The poorer, the more miserable, the more"
283,O. HENRY,"unfortunate--the greater His love and forgiveness."""
284,O. HENRY,
285,O. HENRY,"""Yes, I'm poor,"" said Bulger. ""Awful poor and miserable. You know when"
286,O. HENRY,"I can think best, sergeant? It's when I'm beating the drum. Other"
287,O. HENRY,times there's a kind of muddled roarin' in my head. The drum seems to
288,O. HENRY,"kind of soothe and calm it. There's a thing I'm tryin' to study out,"
289,O. HENRY,"but I ain't made it yet."""
290,O. HENRY,
291,O. HENRY,"""Do you pray, comrade?"" asked the sergeant."
292,O. HENRY,
293,O. HENRY,"""No, I don't,"" said Bulger. ""What'd be the use? I know where the hitch"
294,O. HENRY,is. Don't it say somewhere for a man to give up his own family or
295,O. HENRY,"friends and serve the Lord?"""
296,O. HENRY,
297,O. HENRY,"""If they stand in his way; not otherwise."""
298,O. HENRY,
299,O. HENRY,"""I've got no family,"" continued the old man, ""nor no friends--but one."
300,O. HENRY,"And that one is what's driven me to ruin."""
301,O. HENRY,
302,O. HENRY,"""Free yourself!"" cried the sergeant. ""He is no friend, but an enemy"
303,O. HENRY,"who stands between you and salvation."""
304,O. HENRY,
305,O. HENRY,"""No,"" answered Bulger, emphatically, ""no enemy. The best friend I ever"
306,O. HENRY,"had."""
307,O. HENRY,
308,O. HENRY,"""But you say he's driven you to ruin!"""
309,O. HENRY,
310,O. HENRY,"The old man chuckled dryly: ""And keeps me in rags and livin' on scraps"
311,O. HENRY,and sleepin' like a dog in a patched-up kennel. And yet I never had a
312,O. HENRY,"better friend. You don't understand, sergeant. You lose all your"
313,O. HENRY,"friends but the best one, and then you'll know how to hold on to the"
314,O. HENRY,"last one."""
315,O. HENRY,
316,O. HENRY,"""Do you drink, comrade?"" asked the sergeant."
317,O. HENRY,
318,O. HENRY,"""Not a drop in twenty years,"" Bulger replied. The sergeant was"
319,O. HENRY,puzzled.
320,O. HENRY,
321,O. HENRY,"""If this friend stands between you and your soul's peace, give him"
322,O. HENRY,"up,"" was all he could find to say."
323,O. HENRY,
324,O. HENRY,"""I can't--now,"" said the old man, dropping into a fretful whine. ""But"
325,O. HENRY,"you just let me keep on beating the drum, sergeant, and maybe I will"
326,O. HENRY,some time. I'm a-tryin'. Sometimes I come so near thinkin' it out that
327,O. HENRY,a dozen more licks on the drum would settle it. I get mighty nigh to
328,O. HENRY,"the point, and then I have to quit. You'll give me more time, won't"
329,O. HENRY,"you, sergeant?"""
330,O. HENRY,
331,O. HENRY,"""All you want, and God bless you, comrade. Pound away until you hit"
332,O. HENRY,"the right note."""
333,O. HENRY,
334,O. HENRY,"Afterward the sergeant would often call to Bulger: ""Time, comrade!"
335,O. HENRY,"Knocked that friend of yours out yet?"" The answer was always"
336,O. HENRY,unsatisfactory.
337,O. HENRY,
338,O. HENRY,One night at a street corner the sergeant prayed loudly that a certain
339,O. HENRY,struggling comrade might be parted from an enemy who was leading him
340,O. HENRY,"astray under the guise of friendship. Bulger, in sudden and plainly"
341,O. HENRY,"evident alarm, immediately turned his drum over to a fellow volunteer,"
342,O. HENRY,and shuffled rapidly away down the street. The next night he was back
343,O. HENRY,"again at his post, without any explanation of his strange behaviour."
344,O. HENRY,
345,O. HENRY,"The sergeant wondered what it all meant, and took occasion to question"
346,O. HENRY,the old man more closely as to the influence that was retarding the
347,O. HENRY,peace his soul seemed to crave. But Bulger carefully avoided
348,O. HENRY,particularizing.
349,O. HENRY,
350,O. HENRY,"""It's my own fight,"" he said. ""I've got to think it out myself. Nobody"
351,O. HENRY,"else don't understand."""
352,O. HENRY,
353,O. HENRY,The winter of 1892 was a memorable one in the South. The cold was
354,O. HENRY,"almost unprecedented, and snow fell many inches deep where it had"
355,O. HENRY,rarely whitened the ground before. Much suffering resulted among the
356,O. HENRY,"poor, who had not anticipated the rigorous season. The little squad of"
357,O. HENRY,Salvationists found more distress then they could relieve.
358,O. HENRY,
359,O. HENRY,"Charity in that town, while swift and liberal, lacked organization."
360,O. HENRY,"Want, in that balmy and productive climate, existed only in sporadic"
361,O. HENRY,"cases, and these were nearly always quietly relieved by generous"
362,O. HENRY,neighbours. But when some sudden disastrous onslaught of the
363,O. HENRY,"elements--storm, fire or flood--occurred, the impoverished sufferers"
364,O. HENRY,"were often too slowly aided because system was lacking, and because"
365,O. HENRY,charity was called upon too seldom to become a habit. At such times
366,O. HENRY,the Salvation Army was very useful. Its soldiers went down into alleys
367,O. HENRY,"and byways to rescue those who, unused to extreme want, had never"
368,O. HENRY,learned to beg.
369,O. HENRY,
370,O. HENRY,At the end of three weeks of hard freezing a level foot of snow fell.
371,O. HENRY,"Hunger and cold struck the improvident, and a hundred women, children"
372,O. HENRY,and old men were gathered into the Army's quarters to be warmed and
373,O. HENRY,fed. Each day the blue-uniformed soldiers slipped in and out of the
374,O. HENRY,"stores and offices of the town, gathering pennies and dimes and"
375,O. HENRY,quarters to buy food for the starving. And in and out of private
376,O. HENRY,"houses the Salvationists went with baskets of food and clothing, while"
377,O. HENRY,day by day the mercury still crouched among the tens and twenties.
378,O. HENRY,
379,O. HENRY,"Alas! business, that scapegoat, was dull. The dimes and quarters came"
380,O. HENRY,more reluctantly from tills that jingled not when they were opened.
381,O. HENRY,"Yet in the big hall of the Army the stove was kept red-hot, and upon"
382,O. HENRY,"the long table, set in the rear, could always be found at least coffee"
383,O. HENRY,and bread and cheese. The sergeant and the squad fought valiantly. At
384,O. HENRY,"last the money on hand was all gone, and the daily collections were"
385,O. HENRY,"diminished to a variable sum, inadequate to the needs of the"
386,O. HENRY,dependents of the Army.
387,O. HENRY,
388,O. HENRY,"Christmas was near at hand. There were fifty children in the hall, and"
389,O. HENRY,"many more outside, to whom that season brought no joy beyond what was"
390,O. HENRY,brought by the Army. None of these little pensioners had thus far
391,O. HENRY,"lacked necessary comforts, and they had already begun to chatter of"
392,O. HENRY,the tree--that one bright vision in the sober monotony of the year.
393,O. HENRY,Never since the Army first came had it failed to provide a tree and
394,O. HENRY,gifts for the children.
395,O. HENRY,
396,O. HENRY,"The sergeant was troubled. He knew that an announcement of ""no tree"""
397,O. HENRY,would grieve the hearts under those thin cotton dresses and ragged
398,O. HENRY,jackets more than would stress of storm or scanty diet; and yet there
399,O. HENRY,was not money enough to meet the daily demands for food and fuel.
400,O. HENRY,
401,O. HENRY,On the night of December the 20th the sergeant decided to announce
402,O. HENRY,that there could be no Christmas tree: it seemed unfair to allow the
403,O. HENRY,waxing anticipation of the children to reach too great a height.
404,O. HENRY,
405,O. HENRY,"The evening was colder, and the still deep snow was made deeper by"
406,O. HENRY,another heavy fall swept upon the wings of a fierce and shrill-voiced
407,O. HENRY,"northern gale. The sergeant, with sodden boots and reddened"
408,O. HENRY,"countenance, entered the hall at nightfall, and removed his threadbare"
409,O. HENRY,"overcoat. Soon afterward the rest of the faithful squad drifted in,"
410,O. HENRY,"the women heavily shawled, the men stamping their snow-crusted feet"
411,O. HENRY,"loudly upon the steep stairs. After the slender supper of cold meat,"
412,O. HENRY,"beans, bread, and coffee had been finished all joined in a short"
413,O. HENRY,"service of song and prayer, according to their daily habit."
414,O. HENRY,
415,O. HENRY,Far back in the shadow sat Bulger. For weeks his ears had been
416,O. HENRY,"deprived of that aid to thought, the booming of the big bass drum. His"
417,O. HENRY,wrinkled face wore an expression of gloomy perplexity. The Army had
418,O. HENRY,"been too busy for the regular services and parades. The silent drum,"
419,O. HENRY,"the banners, and the cornets were stored in a little room at the top"
420,O. HENRY,of the stairway.
421,O. HENRY,
422,O. HENRY,Bulger came to the hall every night and ate supper with the others. In
423,O. HENRY,such weather work of the kind that the old man usually did was not to
424,O. HENRY,"be had, and he was bidden to share the benefits conferred upon the"
425,O. HENRY,"other unfortunates. He always left early, and it was surmised that he"
426,O. HENRY,"passed the nights in his patchwork hut, that structure being"
427,O. HENRY,waterproof and weathertight beyond the promise of its outward
428,O. HENRY,appearance. Of late the sergeant had had no time to bestow upon the
429,O. HENRY,old man.
430,O. HENRY,
431,O. HENRY,At seven o'clock the sergeant stood up and rapped upon the table with
432,O. HENRY,"a lump of coal. When the room became still he began his talk, that"
433,O. HENRY,rambled off into a halting discourse quite unlike his usual positive
434,O. HENRY,and direct speeches. The children had gathered about their friend in a
435,O. HENRY,"ragged, wriggling, and wide-a-wake circle. Most of them had seen that"
436,O. HENRY,"fresh, ruddy countenance of his emerge, at the twelve-stroke of a"
437,O. HENRY,"night of splendour, from the whiskered mask of a magnificent Santa"
438,O. HENRY,Claus. They knew now that he was going to speak of the Christmas tree.
439,O. HENRY,
440,O. HENRY,"They tiptoed and listened, flushed with a hopeful and eager awe. The"
441,O. HENRY,"sergeant saw it, frowned, and swallowed hard. Continuing, he planted"
442,O. HENRY,"the sting of disappointment in each expectant little bosom, and"
443,O. HENRY,watched the light fade from their eyes.
444,O. HENRY,
445,O. HENRY,There was to be no tree. Renunciation was no new thing to them; they
446,O. HENRY,had been born to it. Still a few little ones in whom hope died hard
447,O. HENRY,"sobbed aloud, and wan, wretched mothers tried to hush and console"
448,O. HENRY,"them. A kind of voiceless wail went among them, scarcely a protest,"
449,O. HENRY,rather the ghost of a lament for the childhood's pleasures they had
450,O. HENRY,never known. The sergeant sat down and figured cheerlessly with the
451,O. HENRY,stump of a pencil upon the blank border of a newspaper.
452,O. HENRY,
453,O. HENRY,"Bulger rose and shuffled out of the room without ceremony, as was his"
454,O. HENRY,"custom. He was heard fumbling in the little room in the hallway, and"
455,O. HENRY,"suddenly a thunderous roar broke out, filling the whole building with"
456,O. HENRY,"its booming din. The sergeant started, and then laughed as if his"
457,O. HENRY,nerves welcomed the diversion.
458,O. HENRY,
459,O. HENRY,"""It's only Comrade Bulger,"" he said, ""doing a little thinking in his"
460,O. HENRY,"own quiet way."""
461,O. HENRY,
462,O. HENRY,The norther rattled the windows and shrieked around the corners. The
463,O. HENRY,sergeant heaped more coal into the stove. The increase of that cutting
464,O. HENRY,"wind bore the cold promise of days, perhaps weeks, of hard times to"
465,O. HENRY,come. The children were slowly recovering the sad philosophy out of
466,O. HENRY,which the deceptive hope of one bright day had enticed them. The women
467,O. HENRY,were arranging things for the night; preparing to draw the long
468,O. HENRY,"curtain across the width of the hall, separating the children's"
469,O. HENRY,quarters and theirs from those of the men.
470,O. HENRY,
471,O. HENRY,About eight o'clock the sergeant had seen that all was shipshape; and
472,O. HENRY,"was wrapping his woolen comforter around his neck, ready for his cold"
473,O. HENRY,"journey homeward, when footsteps were heard upon the stairway. The"
474,O. HENRY,"door opened, and Bulger came in covered with snow like Santa Claus,"
475,O. HENRY,"and as red of face, but otherwise much unlike the jolly Christmas"
476,O. HENRY,saint.
477,O. HENRY,
478,O. HENRY,"The old man shambled down the hall to where the sergeant stood, drew a"
479,O. HENRY,"wet, earth-soiled bag from under his coat, and laid it upon the table."
480,O. HENRY,"""Open it,"" he said, and motioned to the sergeant."
481,O. HENRY,
482,O. HENRY,That cheery official obeyed with an indulgent smile. He seized the
483,O. HENRY,"bottom of the bag, turned it up, and stood, with his smile turned to a"
484,O. HENRY,"gape of amazement, gazing at a heap of gold and silver coin that"
485,O. HENRY,rolled upon the table.
486,O. HENRY,
487,O. HENRY,"""Count it,"" said Bulger."
488,O. HENRY,
489,O. HENRY,The jingling of the money and wonder at its source had produced a
490,O. HENRY,profound silence in the room. For a time nothing could be heard but
491,O. HENRY,the howling of the wind and the chink of the coins as the sergeant
492,O. HENRY,slowly laid them in little separate piles.
493,O. HENRY,
494,O. HENRY,"""Six hundred,"" said the sergeant, and stopped to clear his throat,"
495,O. HENRY,"""six hundred and twenty-three dollars and eighty-five cents!"""
496,O. HENRY,
497,O. HENRY,"""Eighty,"" said Bulger. ""Mistake of five cents. I've thought it out at"
498,O. HENRY,"last, sergeant, and I've give up that friend I told you about. That's"
499,O. HENRY,him--dollars and cents. The boys was right when they said I was a
500,O. HENRY,"miser. Take it, sergeant, and spend it the best way for them that"
501,O. HENRY,"needs it, not forgettin' a tree for the young 'uns, and--"""
502,O. HENRY,
503,O. HENRY,"""Hallelujah!"" cried the sergeant."
504,O. HENRY,
505,O. HENRY,"""And a new bass drum,"" concluded Bulger."
506,O. HENRY,
507,O. HENRY,And then the sergeant made another speech.
508,O. HENRY,
509,O. HENRY,
510,O. HENRY,
511,O. HENRY,A Professional Secret
512,O. HENRY,The Story of a Maid Made Over
513,O. HENRY,
514,O. HENRY,"Dr. Satterfield Prince, physician to the leisure class, looked at his"
515,O. HENRY,watch. It indicated five minutes to twelve. At the stroke of the hour
516,O. HENRY,would expire the morning term set apart for the reception of his
517,O. HENRY,patients in his handsome office apartments. And then the young woman
518,O. HENRY,attendant ushered in from the waiting-room the last unit of the
519,O. HENRY,wealthy and fashionable gathering that had come to patronize his
520,O. HENRY,skill.
521,O. HENRY,
522,O. HENRY,"Dr. Prince turned, his watch still in hand, his manner courteous, but"
523,O. HENRY,seeming to invite promptness and brevity in the interview. The last
524,O. HENRY,"patient was a middle-aged lady, richly dressed, with an amiable and"
525,O. HENRY,"placid face. When she spoke her voice revealed the drawling, musical"
526,O. HENRY,"slur and intonation of the South. She had come, she leisurely"
527,O. HENRY,"explained, to bespeak the services of Dr. Prince in the case of her"
528,O. HENRY,"daughter, who was possessed of a most mysterious affliction. And then,"
529,O. HENRY,"femininely, she proceeded to exhaustively diagnose the affliction,"
530,O. HENRY,informing the physician with a calm certitude of its origin and
531,O. HENRY,nature.
532,O. HENRY,
533,O. HENRY,The diagnosis advanced by the lady--Mrs. Galloway Rankin--was one so
534,O. HENRY,"marvelously strange and singular in its conception that Dr. Prince,"
535,O. HENRY,accustomed as he was to the conceits and vagaries of wealthy
536,O. HENRY,"malingerers, was actually dumfounded. The following is the matter of"
537,O. HENRY,"Mrs. Rankin's statement, briefly reported:"
538,O. HENRY,
539,O. HENRY,"She--Mrs. Rankin--was of an old Kentucky family, the Bealls. Between"
540,O. HENRY,the Bealls and another historic house--the Rankins--had been waged for
541,O. HENRY,nearly a century one of the fiercest and most sanguinary feuds within
542,O. HENRY,the history of the State. Each generation had kept alive both the hate
543,O. HENRY,"and the warfare, until at length it was said that Nature began to take"
544,O. HENRY,cognizance of the sentiment and Bealls and Rankins were born upon
545,O. HENRY,"earth as antagonistic toward each other as cats and dogs. So, for four"
546,O. HENRY,"generations the war had waged, and the mountains were dotted with"
547,O. HENRY,"tombstones of both families. At last, for lack of fuel to feed upon,"
548,O. HENRY,the feud expired with only one direct descendant of the Bealls and one
549,O. HENRY,"of the Rankins remaining--Evalina Beall, aged nineteen, and Galloway"
550,O. HENRY,"Rankin, aged twenty-five. The last mortal shot in the feud was fired"
551,O. HENRY,"by Cupid. The two survivors met, became immediately and mutually"
552,O. HENRY,"enamoured, and a miracle transpired on Kentucky soil--a Rankin wedded"
553,O. HENRY,a Beall.
554,O. HENRY,
555,O. HENRY,"Interposed, and irrelevant to the story, was the information that coal"
556,O. HENRY,"mines had been discovered later on the Rankin lands, and now the"
557,O. HENRY,Galloway Rankins were to be computed among the millionaries.
558,O. HENRY,
559,O. HENRY,"All that was long enough ago for there to be now a daughter, twenty"
560,O. HENRY,years of age--Miss Annabel Rankin--for whose relief the services of
561,O. HENRY,Dr. Prince was petitioned.
562,O. HENRY,
563,O. HENRY,"Then followed, in Mrs. Rankin's statement, a description of the"
564,O. HENRY,"mysterious, though by her readily accounted for, affliction."
565,O. HENRY,
566,O. HENRY,It seemed that there was a peculiar difficulty in the young lady's
567,O. HENRY,"powers of locomotion. In walking, a process requiring a coordination"
568,O. HENRY,"and unanimity of the functions--Dr. Prince, said Mrs. Rankin, would"
569,O. HENRY,understand and admit the nonexistence of a necessity for anatomical
570,O. HENRY,"specification--there persisted a stubborn opposition, a most contrary"
571,O. HENRY,and counteracting antagonism. In those successively progressive and
572,O. HENRY,generally unconsciously automatic movements necessary to proper
573,O. HENRY,"locomotion, there was a violent lack of harmony and mutuality. To give"
574,O. HENRY,an instance cited by Mrs. Rankin--if Miss Annabel desired to ascend a
575,O. HENRY,"stairway, one foot would be easily advanced to the step above, but"
576,O. HENRY,"instead of aiding and abetting its fellow, the other would at once"
577,O. HENRY,proceed to start downstairs. By a strong physical and mental effort
578,O. HENRY,the young lady could walk fairly well for a short distance but
579,O. HENRY,"suddenly the rebellious entities would become uncontrollable, and she"
580,O. HENRY,"would be compelled to turn undesirable corners, to enter impossible"
581,O. HENRY,"doorways, to dance, shuffle, sidestep and perform other undignified"
582,O. HENRY,and distressing evolutions.
583,O. HENRY,
584,O. HENRY,"After setting forth these lamentable symptoms, Mrs. Rankin"
585,O. HENRY,emphatically asserted her belief that the affliction was the result of
586,O. HENRY,heredity--of the union between the naturally opposing and contrary
587,O. HENRY,Beall and Rankin elements. She believed that the inherited spirit of
588,O. HENRY,"the ancient feud had taken on physical manifestations, exhibiting them"
589,O. HENRY,in the person of the unfortunate outcome of the union of opposites.
590,O. HENRY,That in Miss Annabel Rankin was warring the imperishable antipathy of
591,O. HENRY,"the two families. In other words, that one of Miss Rankin's--that is"
592,O. HENRY,"to say, that when Miss Rankin took a step it was a Beall step, and the"
593,O. HENRY,next one was dominated by the bequeathed opposition of the Rankins.
594,O. HENRY,
595,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince received the communication with his usual grave,"
596,O. HENRY,"professional attention, and promised to call the next day at ten to"
597,O. HENRY,inspect the patient.
598,O. HENRY,
599,O. HENRY,Promptly at the hour his electric runabout turned into the line of
600,O. HENRY,stylish autos and hansoms that wait along the pavements before the
601,O. HENRY,most expensive hostelry on American soil.
602,O. HENRY,
603,O. HENRY,When Miss Annabel Rankin entered the reception parlour of their choice
604,O. HENRY,suite of rooms Doctor Prince gave a little blink of surprise through
605,O. HENRY,his brilliantly polished nose glasses. The glow of perfect health and
606,O. HENRY,the contour of perfect beauty were visible in the face and form of the
607,O. HENRY,young lady. But admiration gave way to sympathy when he saw her walk.
608,O. HENRY,"She entered at a little run, swayed, stepped off helplessly at a sharp"
609,O. HENRY,"tangent, advanced, marked time, backed off, recovered and sidled with"
610,O. HENRY,"a manoeuvring rush to a couch, where she rested, with a look of"
611,O. HENRY,serious melancholy upon her handsome face.
612,O. HENRY,
613,O. HENRY,"Dr. Prince proceeded with his interrogatories in the delicate,"
614,O. HENRY,reassuring gentlemanly manner that had brought him so many patrons who
615,O. HENRY,placed a value upon those amenities. Miss Annabel answered frankly and
616,O. HENRY,"sensibly, indeed, for one of her years. The feud theory of Mrs. Rankin"
617,O. HENRY,was freely discussed. The daughter also believed in it.
618,O. HENRY,
619,O. HENRY,"Soon the physician departed, promising to call again and administer"
620,O. HENRY,treatment. Then he buzzed down the Avenue and four doors on an
621,O. HENRY,"asphalted side street to the office of Dr. Grumbleton Myers, the great"
622,O. HENRY,specialist in locomotor ataxia and nerve ailments. The two
623,O. HENRY,"distinguished physicians shut themselves in a private office, and the"
624,O. HENRY,great Myers dragged forth a decanter of sherry and a box of Havanas.
625,O. HENRY,When the consultation was over both shook their heads.
626,O. HENRY,
627,O. HENRY,"""Fact is,"" summed up Myers, ""we don't know anything about anything."
628,O. HENRY,I'd say treat symptoms now until something turns up; but there are no
629,O. HENRY,"symptoms."""
630,O. HENRY,
631,O. HENRY,"""The feud diagnosis, then?"" suggested Doctor Prince, archly, ridding"
632,O. HENRY,his cigar of its ash.
633,O. HENRY,
634,O. HENRY,"""It's an interesting case,"" said the specialist, noncommittally."
635,O. HENRY,
636,O. HENRY,"""I say, Prince,"" called Myers, as his caller was leaving."
637,O. HENRY,"""Er--sometimes, you know, children that fight and quarrel are shut in"
638,O. HENRY,"separate rooms. Doesn't it seem a pity, now, that bloomers aren't in"
639,O. HENRY,"fashion? By separ--"""
640,O. HENRY,
641,O. HENRY,"""But they aren't,"" smiled Doctor Prince, ""and we must be fashionable,"
642,O. HENRY,"at any rate."""
643,O. HENRY,
644,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince burned midnight oil--or its equivalent, a patent,"
645,O. HENRY,"electric, soft-shaded, midnight incandescent, over his case. With such"
646,O. HENRY,little success did his light shine that he was forced to make a little
647,O. HENRY,speech to the Rankins full of scientific terms--a thing he
648,O. HENRY,conscientiously avoided with his patients--which shows that he was
649,O. HENRY,driven to expedient. At last he was reduced to suggest treatment by
650,O. HENRY,hypnotism.
651,O. HENRY,
652,O. HENRY,"Being crowded further, he advised it, and appeared another day with"
653,O. HENRY,"Professor Adami, the most reputable and non-advertising one he could"
654,O. HENRY,find among that school of practitioners.
655,O. HENRY,
656,O. HENRY,"Miss Annabel, gentle and melancholy, fell an easy victim--or, I should"
657,O. HENRY,"say, subject--to the professor's influence. Previously instructed by"
658,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince in the nature of the malady he was about to combat, the"
659,O. HENRY,"dealer in mental drugs proceeded to offer ""suggestion"" (in the"
660,O. HENRY,"language of his school) to the afflicted and unconscious young lady,"
661,O. HENRY,impressing her mind with the conviction that her affliction was
662,O. HENRY,moonshine and her perambulatory powers without impairment.
663,O. HENRY,
664,O. HENRY,"When the spell was removed Miss Rankin sat up, looking a little"
665,O. HENRY,"bewildered at first, and then rose to her feet, walking straight"
666,O. HENRY,"across the room with the grace, the sureness and the ease of a Diana,"
667,O. HENRY,"a Leslie-Carter, or a Vassar basketball champion. Miss Annabel's sad"
668,O. HENRY,face was now lit with hope and joy. Mrs. Rankin of Southern
669,O. HENRY,"susceptibility wept a little, delightedly, upon a minute lace"
670,O. HENRY,handkerchief. Miss Annabel continued to walk about firmly and
671,O. HENRY,"accurately, in absolute control of the machinery necessary for her so"
672,O. HENRY,"to do. Doctor Prince quietly congratulated Professor Adami, and then"
673,O. HENRY,"stepped forward, smilingly rubbing his nose glasses with an air. His"
674,O. HENRY,"position enabled him to overshadow the hypnotizer who, contented to"
675,O. HENRY,"occupy the background temporarily, was busy estimating in his mind"
676,O. HENRY,with how large a bill for services he would dare to embellish the
677,O. HENRY,occasion when he should come to the front.
678,O. HENRY,
679,O. HENRY,"Amid repeated expressions of gratitude, the two professional gentlemen"
680,O. HENRY,"made their adieus, a little elated at the success of the treatment"
681,O. HENRY,"which, with one of them, had been an experiment, with the other an"
682,O. HENRY,exhibition.
683,O. HENRY,
684,O. HENRY,"As the door closed behind them. Miss Annabel, her usually serious and"
685,O. HENRY,"pensive temper somewhat enlivened by the occasion, sat at the piano"
686,O. HENRY,"and dashed into a stirring march. Outside, the two men moving toward"
687,O. HENRY,the elevator heard a scream of alarm from her and hastened back. They
688,O. HENRY,"found her on the piano-stool, with one hand still pressing the keys."
689,O. HENRY,"The other arm was extended rigidly to its full length behind her, its"
690,O. HENRY,fingers tightly clenched into a pink and pretty little fist. Her
691,O. HENRY,"mother was bending over her, joining in the alarm and surprise. Miss"
692,O. HENRY,"Rankin rose from the stool, now quiet, but again depressed and sad."
693,O. HENRY,
694,O. HENRY,"""I don't know what did it,"" she said, plaintively; ""I began to play"
695,O. HENRY,and that arm shot back. It wouldn't stay near the piano while the
696,O. HENRY,"other one was there."""
697,O. HENRY,
698,O. HENRY,A ping-pong table stood in the room.
699,O. HENRY,
700,O. HENRY,"""A little game, Miss Rankin,"" cried Professor Adami, gayly, trying to"
701,O. HENRY,feel his way.
702,O. HENRY,
703,O. HENRY,"They played. With the racquet in the refractory arm, Miss Annabel"
704,O. HENRY,played in fine style. Her control of it was perfect. The professor
705,O. HENRY,laid down his racquet.
706,O. HENRY,
707,O. HENRY,"""Ah! a button is loose on my coat,"" said he. ""Such is the fate of"
708,O. HENRY,"sorrowful bachelors. A needle and thread, now. Miss Rankin?"""
709,O. HENRY,
710,O. HENRY,"A little surprised, but smiling acquiescence, Annabel brought the"
711,O. HENRY,articles from another room.
712,O. HENRY,
713,O. HENRY,"""Now thread the needle, if you please,"" said Professor Adami."
714,O. HENRY,
715,O. HENRY,Annabel bit off two feet of the black silk. When she came to thread
716,O. HENRY,the needle the secret was out. As the hand presenting the thread
717,O. HENRY,approached the other holding the needle that arm was jerked violently
718,O. HENRY,away. Doctor Prince was first to reduce the painful discovery to
719,O. HENRY,words.
720,O. HENRY,
721,O. HENRY,"""Dear Miss and Mrs. Rankin,"" he said, in his most musical"
722,O. HENRY,"consolation-baritone, ""we have been only partially successful. The"
723,O. HENRY,"affliction, Miss Rankin, has passed from your--that is, the affliction"
724,O. HENRY,"is now in your arms."""
725,O. HENRY,
726,O. HENRY,"""Oh, dear!"" sighed Annabel, ""I've a Beall arm and a Rankin arm, then."
727,O. HENRY,"Well, I can use one hand at a time, anyway. People won't notice it as"
728,O. HENRY,"they did before. Oh, what an annoyance those feuds were, to be sure!"
729,O. HENRY,"It seems to me they should make laws against them."""
730,O. HENRY,
731,O. HENRY,Doctor Prince looked inquiringly at Professor Adami. That gentleman
732,O. HENRY,"shook his head. ""Another day,"" he said. ""I prefer not to establish the"
733,O. HENRY,"condition at a lesser interval than two or three days."""
734,O. HENRY,
735,O. HENRY,"So, three days afterward they returned, and the professor replaced"
736,O. HENRY,"Miss Rankin under control. This time there was, apparently, perfect"
737,O. HENRY,"success. She came forth from the trance, and with full muscular"
738,O. HENRY,"powers. She walked the floor with a sure, rhythmic step. She played"
739,O. HENRY,"several difficult selections upon the piano, the hands and arms moving"
740,O. HENRY,with propriety and with allied ease. Miss Rankin seemed at last to
741,O. HENRY,possess a perfectly well-ordered physical being as well as a very
742,O. HENRY,grateful mental one.
743,O. HENRY,
744,O. HENRY,"A week afterward there wafted into Doctor Prince's office a youth,"
745,O. HENRY,generously gilded. The hallmarks of society were deeply writ upon him.
746,O. HENRY,
747,O. HENRY,"""I'm Ashburton,"" he explained; ""T. Ripley Ashburton, you know. I'm"
748,O. HENRY,engaged to Miss Rankin. I understand you've been training her for some
749,O. HENRY,"breaks in her gaits--"" T. Ripley Ashburton caught himself. ""Didn't"
750,O. HENRY,"mean that, you know--slipped out--been loafing around stables quite a"
751,O. HENRY,"lot. I say, Doctor Prince, I want you to tell me. Candidly, you know."
752,O. HENRY,I'm awful spoons on Miss Rankin. We're to be married in the fall. You
753,O. HENRY,"might consider me one of the family, you know. They told me about the"
754,O. HENRY,treatment you gave her with the--er--medium fellow. That set her up
755,O. HENRY,"wonderfully, I assure you. She goes freely now, and handles her"
756,O. HENRY,"fore--I mean you know, she's over all that old trouble. But there's"
757,O. HENRY,something else started up that's making the track pretty heavy; so I
758,O. HENRY,"called, don't you understand."""
759,O. HENRY,
760,O. HENRY,"""I had not been advised,"" said Doctor Prince, ""of any recurrence of"
761,O. HENRY,"Miss Rankin's indisposition."""
762,O. HENRY,
763,O. HENRY,T. Ripley Ashburton produced a silver cigarette-case and contemplated
764,O. HENRY,"it tenderly. Receiving no encouragement, he replaced it in his pocket"
765,O. HENRY,with a sigh.
766,O. HENRY,
767,O. HENRY,"""Not a recurrence,"" he said, thoughtfully, ""but something different."
768,O. HENRY,Possibly I'm the only one in a position to know. Hate to discuss
769,O. HENRY,"it--reveal Cupid's secrets, you know--such a jolly low thing to"
770,O. HENRY,"do--but suppose the occasion justifies it."""
771,O. HENRY,
772,O. HENRY,"""If you possess any information or have observed anything,"" said"
773,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince, judicially, ""through which Miss Rankin's condition"
774,O. HENRY,"might be benefited, it is your duty, of course, to apply it in her"
775,O. HENRY,behalf. I need hardly remind you that such disclosures are held as
776,O. HENRY,"secrets on professional honour."""
777,O. HENRY,
778,O. HENRY,"""I believe I mentioned,"" said Mr. Ashburton, his fingers still"
779,O. HENRY,"hovering around the pocket containing his cigarette case, ""that Miss"
780,O. HENRY,"Rankin and I are ever so sweet upon each other. She's a jolly, swell"
781,O. HENRY,"girl, if she did come from the Kentucky mountains. Lately she's acted"
782,O. HENRY,"awful queerly. She's awful affectionate one minute, and the next she"
783,O. HENRY,turns me down like a perfect stranger. Last night I called at the
784,O. HENRY,"hotel, and she met me at the door of their rooms. Nobody was in sight,"
785,O. HENRY,"and she gave me an awful nice kiss--er--engaged, you know, Doctor"
786,O. HENRY,Prince--and then she fired away and gave me an awful hard slap in the
787,O. HENRY,"face. 'I hate the sight of you,' she said; 'how dare you take the"
788,O. HENRY,"liberty!'"" Mr. Ashburton drew an envelope from his pocket and"
789,O. HENRY,extracted from it a sheet of note paper of a delicate heliotrope tint.
790,O. HENRY,"""You might read this note, you know. Can't say if it's a medical case,"
791,O. HENRY,"'pon my honour, but I'm awfully queered, don't you understand."""
792,O. HENRY,
793,O. HENRY,Doctor Prince read the following lines:
794,O. HENRY,
795,O. HENRY,My dearest Ripley:
796,O. HENRY,
797,O. HENRY,Do come around this evening--there's a dear boy--and take
798,O. HENRY,"me out somewhere. Mamma has a headache, and says she'll be"
799,O. HENRY,glad to be rid of both of us for a while. 'Twas so sweet
800,O. HENRY,of you to send those pond lilies--they're just what I
801,O. HENRY,wanted for the east windows. You darling boy--you're so
802,O. HENRY,thoughtful and good--I'm sure you're worth all the love of
803,O. HENRY,
804,O. HENRY,Your very own
805,O. HENRY,Annabel.
806,O. HENRY,
807,O. HENRY,"P.S.--On second thoughts, I will ask you not to call this"
808,O. HENRY,"evening, as I shall be otherwise engaged. Perhaps it has"
809,O. HENRY,never occurred to you that there may be two opinions about
810,O. HENRY,the vast pleasure you seem to think your society affords
811,O. HENRY,others. Clothes and the small talk of clubhouses and
812,O. HENRY,racetracks hardly ever succeed in making a man without
813,O. HENRY,other accessories.
814,O. HENRY,
815,O. HENRY,"Very respectfully,"
816,O. HENRY,Annabel Rankin.
817,O. HENRY,
818,O. HENRY,"Being deprived of the aid of his consolation cylinders, T. Ripley"
819,O. HENRY,"Ashburton sat, gloomy, revolving things in his mind."
820,O. HENRY,
821,O. HENRY,"""Ah!"" exclaimed Doctor Prince, aloud, but addressing the exclamation"
822,O. HENRY,"to himself; ""driven from the arms to the heart!"" He perceived that the"
823,O. HENRY,"mysterious hereditary contrariety had, indeed, taken up its lodging in"
824,O. HENRY,that tender organ of the afflicted maiden.
825,O. HENRY,
826,O. HENRY,"The gilded youth was dismissed, with the promise that Doctor Prince"
827,O. HENRY,"would make a professional call upon Miss Rankin. He did so soon, in"
828,O. HENRY,"company with Professor Adami, after they had discussed the strange"
829,O. HENRY,course taken by this annoying heritage of the Bealls and Rankins. This
830,O. HENRY,"time, as the location of the disorder required that the subject be"
831,O. HENRY,"approached with ingenuity, some diplomacy was exercised before the"
832,O. HENRY,young lady could be induced to submit herself to the professor's art.
833,O. HENRY,"But evidently she did so, and emerged from the trance as usual without"
834,O. HENRY,a trace of unpleasant effect.
835,O. HENRY,
836,O. HENRY,With much interest and some anxiety Doctor Prince passed several days
837,O. HENRY,"awaiting the report of Mr. Ashburton, who, indeed, of all others would"
838,O. HENRY,"have to be depended upon to observe improvements, if any had occurred."
839,O. HENRY,"One morning that youth dropped in, jubilant."
840,O. HENRY,
841,O. HENRY,"""It's all right, you know,"" he declared, cheerfully. ""Miss Rankin's"
842,O. HENRY,"herself again. She's as sweet as cream, and the trouble's all off."
843,O. HENRY,"Never a cross word or look. I'm her ducky, all right. She won't"
844,O. HENRY,believe what I tell her about the way she used to treat me. Intimates
845,O. HENRY,I make up the stories. But it's all right now--everything's running on
846,O. HENRY,"rubber tires. Awfully obliged to you and the old boy--er--the medium,"
847,O. HENRY,"you know. And I say, now, Doctor Prince, there's a wonderful"
848,O. HENRY,"improvement in Miss Rankin in every way. She used to be rather stiff,"
849,O. HENRY,"don't you understand--sort of superior, in a way--bookish, and a habit"
850,O. HENRY,"of thinking things, you know. Well, she's cured all round--she's a"
851,O. HENRY,"topper now of any bunch in the set--swell and stylish and lively! Oh,"
852,O. HENRY,the crowd will fall in to her lead when she becomes Mrs. T. Ripley.
853,O. HENRY,"Now, I say. Doctor Prince, you and the--er--medium gentleman come and"
854,O. HENRY,take supper tonight with Mrs. and Miss Rankin and me. I'd be delighted
855,O. HENRY,"if you would, now--I would indeed--just for you to see, you know, the"
856,O. HENRY,"improvement in Miss Rankin."""
857,O. HENRY,
858,O. HENRY,It transpired that Doctor Prince and Professor Adami accepted Mr.
859,O. HENRY,Ashburton's invitation. They convened at the hotel in the rooms of the
860,O. HENRY,Rankins. From there they were to proceed to the restaurant honoured by
861,O. HENRY,Mr. Ashburton's patronage.
862,O. HENRY,
863,O. HENRY,When Miss Rankin swept gracefully into the room the professional
864,O. HENRY,gentlemen felt fascination and surprise conflicting in their feelings.
865,O. HENRY,"She was radiant, bewitching, lively to effervescence. Her mother and"
866,O. HENRY,"Mr. Ashburton hung, enraptured, upon her looks and words. She was most"
867,O. HENRY,becomingly clothed in pale blue.
868,O. HENRY,
869,O. HENRY,"""Oh, bother!"" she suddenly exclaimed, most vivaciously, ""I don't like"
870,O. HENRY,"this dress, after all. You must all wait,"" she commanded, with a"
871,O. HENRY,"captivating fling of her train, ""until I change."" Half an hour later"
872,O. HENRY,"she returned, magnificent in a stunning costume of black lace."
873,O. HENRY,
874,O. HENRY,"""I'll walk with you downstairs, Professor Adami,"" she declared, with a"
875,O. HENRY,charming smile. Halfway down she left his side abruptly and joined
876,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince. ""You've been such a benefit to me,"" she said. ""It's"
877,O. HENRY,"such a relief to get rid of that horrid feud thing. Heavens! Ripley,"
878,O. HENRY,"did you forget those bonbons? Oh, this horrid black dress! I shouldn't"
879,O. HENRY,have worn it; it makes me think of funerals. Did you get the scent of
880,O. HENRY,those lilacs then? It makes me think of the Kentucky mountains. How I
881,O. HENRY,"wish we were back there."""
882,O. HENRY,
883,O. HENRY,"""Aren't you fond of New York, then?"" asked Doctor Prince, regarding"
884,O. HENRY,her interestedly.
885,O. HENRY,
886,O. HENRY,She started at the sound of his voice and looked up vivaciously.
887,O. HENRY,
888,O. HENRY,"""Indeed I am,"" she said, earnestly. ""I adore New York. Why, I couldn't"
889,O. HENRY,"live without theatres and dances and my daily drives here. Oh,"
890,O. HENRY,"Ripley,"" she called, over her shoulder, ""don't get that bull pup I"
891,O. HENRY,"wanted; I've changed my mind. I want a Pomeranian--now, don't forget."""
892,O. HENRY,
893,O. HENRY,They arrived on the pavement.
894,O. HENRY,
895,O. HENRY,"""Oh, a carriage!"" exclaimed Miss Rankin; ""I don't want a carriage, I"
896,O. HENRY,"want an auto. Send it away!"""
897,O. HENRY,
898,O. HENRY,"""All right,"" said Ashburton, cheerily, ""I thought you said a"
899,O. HENRY,"carriage."""
900,O. HENRY,
901,O. HENRY,In obedience to orders the carriage rolled away and an open auto
902,O. HENRY,glided up in its place.
903,O. HENRY,
904,O. HENRY,"""Stuffy, smelly thing!"" cried Miss Rankin, with a winsome pout. ""We'll"
905,O. HENRY,"walk. Ripley, you and Doctor Prince look out for mamma. Come on,"
906,O. HENRY,"Professor Adami."" The indulgent victims of the charming beauty obeyed."
907,O. HENRY,
908,O. HENRY,"""The dear, dear child!"" exclaimed Mrs. Rankin, happily, to Doctor"
909,O. HENRY,"Prince. ""How full of spirits and life she is getting to be! She's so"
910,O. HENRY,"much improved from her old self."""
911,O. HENRY,
912,O. HENRY,"""Lots,"" said Ashburton, proudly and fatuously. ""She's picked up the"
913,O. HENRY,regular metropolitan gaits. Chic and swell don't begin to express her.
914,O. HENRY,She's cut out the pensive thought business. Up-to-date. Why she
915,O. HENRY,"changes her mind every two minutes. That's Annabel."""
916,O. HENRY,
917,O. HENRY,"At the fashionable restaurant where they were soon seated, Doctor"
918,O. HENRY,Prince found his curiosity and interest engaged by Miss Rankin's
919,O. HENRY,behaviour. She was in an agreeably fascinating humour. Her actions
920,O. HENRY,were such as might be expected from an adored child whose vacillating
921,O. HENRY,whims were indulged by groveling relatives. She ordered article after
922,O. HENRY,"article from the bill of fare, petulantly countermanding nearly"
923,O. HENRY,"everyone when they were set before her. Waiters flew and returned,"
924,O. HENRY,"collided, conciliated, apologized, and danced at her bidding. Her"
925,O. HENRY,"speech was quick and lively, deliciously inconsistent, abounding in"
926,O. HENRY,"contradictions, conflicting statements, ""bulls,"" discrepancies and"
927,O. HENRY,"nonconformities. In short, she seemed to have acquired within the"
928,O. HENRY,"space of a few days all that inconsequent, illogical frothiness that"
929,O. HENRY,passes current among certain circles of fashionable life.
930,O. HENRY,
931,O. HENRY,Mr. T. Ripley Ashburton showed a doting appreciation and an addled
932,O. HENRY,delight at the new charms of his fiancee--charms that he at once
933,O. HENRY,recognized as the legal tender of his set.
934,O. HENRY,
935,O. HENRY,"Later, when the party had broken up, Doctor Prince and Professor Adami"
936,O. HENRY,"stood, for a moment, at a corner, where their ways were to diverge."
937,O. HENRY,
938,O. HENRY,"""Well,"" said the professor, who was genially softened by the excellent"
939,O. HENRY,"supper and wine, ""this time our young lady seems to be more fortunate."
940,O. HENRY,"The malady has been eradicated completely from her entity. Yes, sir,"
941,O. HENRY,"in good time, our school will be recognized by all."""
942,O. HENRY,
943,O. HENRY,"Doctor Prince scrutinized the handsome, refined countenance of the"
944,O. HENRY,hypnotist. He saw nothing there to indicate that his own diagnosis was
945,O. HENRY,even guessed at by that gentleman.
946,O. HENRY,
947,O. HENRY,"""As you say,"" he made answer, ""she appears to have recovered, as far"
948,O. HENRY,"as her friends can judge."""
949,O. HENRY,
950,O. HENRY,When he could spare the time. Doctor Prince again invaded the sanctum
951,O. HENRY,"of the great Grumbleton Myers, and together they absorbed the poison"
952,O. HENRY,of nicotine.
953,O. HENRY,
954,O. HENRY,"""Yes,"" said the great Myers, when the door was opened and Doctor"
955,O. HENRY,"Prince began to ooze out with the smoke, ""I think you have come to the"
956,O. HENRY,right decision. As long as none of the persons concerned has any
957,O. HENRY,"suspicion of the truth, and is happy in the present circumstances, I"
958,O. HENRY,don't think it necessary to inform him that the _feuditis Beallorum et
959,O. HENRY,"Rankinorum_--how's the Latin, doctor?--has only been driven to Miss"
960,O. HENRY,"Rankin's brain."""
961,O. HENRY,

963,O. HENRY,
964,O. HENRY,The Elusive Tenderloin
965,O. HENRY,
966,O. HENRY,"There is no Tenderloin. There never was. That is, none that you could"
967,O. HENRY,run a tapeline around. The word really implies a condition or a
968,O. HENRY,"quality--much as you would say ""reprehensibility"" or ""cold feet."""
969,O. HENRY,
970,O. HENRY,Metes and bounds have been assigned to it. I know. Realists
971,O. HENRY,"have prated of ""from Fourteenth to Forty-second,"" and ""as far"
972,O. HENRY,"west as"" etc., but the larger meaning of the word remains with me."
973,O. HENRY,
974,O. HENRY,Confirmation of my interpretation of the famous slaughterhouse
975,O. HENRY,"noun-adjective came to me from Bill Jeremy, a friend out of the West."
976,O. HENRY,Bill lives in a town on the edge of the prairie-dog country. At times
977,O. HENRY,"Bill yearns to maintain the tradition that ""ginger shall be hot i' the"
978,O. HENRY,"mouth."" He brought his last yearning to New York. And it devolved upon"
979,O. HENRY,me. You know what that means.
980,O. HENRY,
981,O. HENRY,I took Bill to see the cavity that has been drilled in the city's
982,O. HENRY,"tooth, soon to be filled with the new gold subway; and the Eden Musee,"
983,O. HENRY,and the Flatiron and the crack in the front windowpane of Russell
984,O. HENRY,"Sage's house, and the old man that threw the stone that did it when he"
985,O. HENRY,was a boy--and I asked Bill what he thought of New York.
986,O. HENRY,
987,O. HENRY,"""You may mean well,"" said Bill, with gentle reproach, ""but you've got"
988,O. HENRY,in a groove. You thought I was underwear buyer for the Blue-Front Dry
989,O. HENRY,"Goods Emporium of Pine Knob, NC, didn't you? Or the junior partner of"
990,O. HENRY,"Slowcoach & Green, of Geegeewocomee, State of Goobers, come on for"
991,O. HENRY,"the fall stock of jeans, lingerie, and whetstones? Don't treat me like"
992,O. HENRY,a business friend.
993,O. HENRY,
994,O. HENRY,"""Do you suppose the wild, insensate longing I feel for metropolitan"
995,O. HENRY,gayety is going to be satisfied by waxworks and razorback
996,O. HENRY,architecture? Now you get out the old envelope with the itinerary on
997,O. HENRY,"it, and cross out the Brooklyn Bridge and the cab that Morgan rides"
998,O. HENRY,"home in and the remaining objects of interest, for I am going it"
999,O. HENRY,"alone. The Tenderloin, well done, is what I shall admire for to see."""
1000,O. HENRY,
1001,O. HENRY,Bill Jeremy has a way of doing as he says he will. So I did not urge
1002,O. HENRY,"upon him the bridge, or Carnegie Hall or the great Tomb--wonders that"

1004,O. HENRY,
1005,O. HENRY,"That evening Bill descended, unprotected, upon the Tenderloin. The"
1006,O. HENRY,next day he came and put his feet upon my desk and told me about it.
1007,O. HENRY,
1008,O. HENRY,"""This Tenderloin,"" said he, ""is a cross between a fake sideshow and a"
1009,O. HENRY,"footrace. It's a movable feast--somethin' like Easter, or tryin' to"

1015,O. HENRY,"Forty-second, with Fourth Avenue and Seventh on each side of it. Well,"
1016,O. HENRY,I started up from Fourteenth so I wouldn't miss any of it. Lots of

1127,O. HENRY,
1128,O. HENRY,"Again today, at a certain street, on the ragged boundaries of the"
1129,O. HENRY,"city, Lawrence Holcombe stopped the trolley car and got off. Holcombe"
1130,O. HENRY,"was a handsome, prosperous business man of forty; a man of high social"
1131,O. HENRY,standing and connections. His comfortable suburban residence was some
1132,O. HENRY,five miles farther out on the car line from the street where so often
1133,O. HENRY,of late he had dropped off the outgoing car. The conductor winked at a
1134,O. HENRY,"regular passenger, and nodded his head archly in the direction of"
1135,O. HENRY,Holcombe's hurrying figure.
1136,O. HENRY,
1137,O. HENRY,"""Getting to be a regular thing,"" commented the conductor."
1138,O. HENRY,
1139,O. HENRY,Holcombe picked his way gingerly down a roughly graded side street
1140,O. HENRY,infested with ragged urchins and impeded by abandoned tinware. He
1141,O. HENRY,stopped at a small cottage fenced in with a patch of stony ground with
1142,O. HENRY,"a few stunted shade-trees growing about it. A stout, middle-aged woman"
1143,O. HENRY,was washing clothes in a tub at one side of the door. She looked
1144,O. HENRY,"around, and smiled a smile of fat recognition."
1145,O. HENRY,

1147,O. HENRY,"inside, sir."""
1148,O. HENRY,

1151,O. HENRY,

1178,O. HENRY,
1179,O. HENRY,"Holcombe stepped inside the cottage. Katie Flynn, with rolled-up"
1180,O. HENRY,"sleeves, was ironing a dress of flounced muslin. Criticism of"
1181,O. HENRY,Holcombe's deviation from his own sphere to this star of lower orbit
1182,O. HENRY,must have waned at the sight of the girl. Her beauty was of the most
1183,O. HENRY,"solvent and convincing sort. Dusky Irish eyes, one great braid of"
1184,O. HENRY,"jetty, shining hair, a crimson mouth, dimpling and shaping itself to"
1185,O. HENRY,"every mood of its owner, a figure strong and graceful, seemingly full"
1186,O. HENRY,of imperishable life and action--Katie Flynn was one to be sought
1187,O. HENRY,after and striven for.
1188,O. HENRY,
1189,O. HENRY,"Holcombe went and stood by her side as she ironed, and watched the"
1190,O. HENRY,lithe play of muscles rolling beneath the satiny skin of her rounded
1191,O. HENRY,forearms.
1192,O. HENRY,
1193,O. HENRY,"""Katie,"" he said, his voice concealing a certain anxiety beneath a"
1194,O. HENRY,"wooing tenderness, ""I have come for my answer. It isn't necessary to"
1195,O. HENRY,"repeat what we have talked over so often, but you know how anxious I"
1196,O. HENRY,"am to have you. You know my circumstances and position, and that you"
1197,O. HENRY,will have every comfort and every privilege that you could ask for.
1198,O. HENRY,"Say 'Yes,' Katie, and I'll be the luckiest man in this town today."""
1199,O. HENRY,
1200,O. HENRY,"Kate set her iron down with a metallic click, and leaned her elbows"
1201,O. HENRY,"upon the ironing board. Her great blue-black eyes went, in their Irish"

1203,O. HENRY,
1204,O. HENRY,"""Oh, Mr. Holcombe, I don't know what to say. I know you'd be kind to"

1211,O. HENRY,
1212,O. HENRY,"""Who is this fellow Conlan, Katie?"" he asked. ""Every time I nearly get"
1213,O. HENRY,your consent he comes between us. Does he want you to live always in

1216,O. HENRY,
1217,O. HENRY,"""He wants me,"" said Katie, in the voice of a small, spoiled child."
1218,O. HENRY,
1219,O. HENRY,"""Well, I want you too,"" said Holcombe, masterfully. ""If I could see"
1220,O. HENRY,"this wonderful Mr. Conlan, of the persuasive tongue, I'd argue the"
1221,O. HENRY,"matter with him."""
1222,O. HENRY,
1223,O. HENRY,"""He's been the champion middleweight fighter of this town,"" said"
1224,O. HENRY,"Katie, a bit mischievously."
1225,O. HENRY,
1226,O. HENRY,"""Oh, has he! Well, that doesn't frighten me, Katie. In fact, I am not"
1227,O. HENRY,"sure but what I'd tackle him a few rounds myself, with you for the"

1229,O. HENRY,
1230,O. HENRY,"""Whist! there he comes now,"" exclaimed Katie, her eyes widening a"
1231,O. HENRY,little with apprehension.
1232,O. HENRY,
1233,O. HENRY,Holcombe looked out the door and saw a young man coming up from the
1234,O. HENRY,gate. He walked with an easy swagger. His face was smooth and
1235,O. HENRY,"truculent, but not bad. He wore a cap pulled down to one eye. He"
1236,O. HENRY,walked inside the house and stopped at the door of the room in which
1237,O. HENRY,stood his rival and the bone of contention.
1238,O. HENRY,
1239,O. HENRY,"""You're after my girl again, are you?"" he grumbled, huskily and"
1240,O. HENRY,"ominously. ""I don't like it, do you see? I've told her so, and I tell"
1241,O. HENRY,you so. She stays here. For ten cents I'd knock your block off. Do you
1242,O. HENRY,"see?"""
1243,O. HENRY,
1244,O. HENRY,"""Now Mr. Conlan,"" began Holcombe, striving to avoid the _argumentum ad"
1245,O. HENRY,"hominem_, ""listen to reason. It is only fair to let Katie choose for"
1246,O. HENRY,herself. Is it quite the square thing to try to prevent her from doing
1247,O. HENRY,what she prefers to do? If it had not been for your interference I
1248,O. HENRY,"would have had her long ago."""
1249,O. HENRY,
1250,O. HENRY,"""For five cents,"" pursued the unmoved Mr. Conlan, lowering his terms,"
1251,O. HENRY,"""I'd knock your block off."""
1252,O. HENRY,
1253,O. HENRY,Into Holcombe's eye there came the light of desperate resolve. He saw
1254,O. HENRY,but one way to clear the obstacle from his path.
1255,O. HENRY,
1256,O. HENRY,"""I am told,"" he said quietly and firmly, ""that you are a fighter. Your"
1257,O. HENRY,mind seems to dwell upon physical combat as the solution to all
1258,O. HENRY,"questions. Now, Conlan, I'm no scrapper, but I'll fight you to a"
1259,O. HENRY,finish any time within the next three minutes to see who gets the
1260,O. HENRY,"girl. If I win she goes with me. If you win you have your way, and"
1261,O. HENRY,"I'll not trouble her again. Are you game?"""
1262,O. HENRY,
1263,O. HENRY,"Danny Conlan's hard, blue eyes looked a sudden admiration."
1264,O. HENRY,
1265,O. HENRY,"""You're all right,"" he conceded with gruff candour. ""I didn't think"
1266,O. HENRY,"you was that sort. You're all right. It's a dead fair sporting prop.,"
1267,O. HENRY,and I'm your company. I'll stand by the results according to terms.
1268,O. HENRY,"Come on, and I'll show you where it can be pulled off. You're all"
1269,O. HENRY,"right."""
1270,O. HENRY,
1271,O. HENRY,"Katie tried to interfere, but Danny silenced her. He led Holcombe down"
1272,O. HENRY,the hill to a deep gully that sheltered them from view. Night was just
1273,O. HENRY,closing in upon the twilight. They laid aside their coats and hats.
1274,O. HENRY,"Here was a situation in the methodical existence of Lawrence Holcombe,"
1275,O. HENRY,"real estate and bond broker, representative business man of"
1276,O. HENRY,unquestionable habits and social position! Fighting with a
1277,O. HENRY,professional tough in a gully in a squalid settlement for the daughter
1278,O. HENRY,of an Irish washerwoman!
1279,O. HENRY,
1280,O. HENRY,"The combat was a short one. If it had lasted longer, Holcombe would"
1281,O. HENRY,"have lost, for both his wind and his science had deteriorated from"
1282,O. HENRY,"long lack of training. Therefore, he forced the fighting from the"
1283,O. HENRY,start. It is difficult to say to what he owed his victory over the
1284,O. HENRY,once champion middleweight. One thing in his favour was that Mr.
1285,O. HENRY,Conlan's nerve and judgment had been somewhat shattered by the effects
1286,O. HENRY,of a recent spree. Another must have been that Holcombe was stimulated
1287,O. HENRY,to supreme exertion by an absorbing incentive to win--a prompting more
1288,O. HENRY,"powerful than the instinct of the gladiator, deeper than all the"
1289,O. HENRY,"motives of gallantry, and more important than the vital influence of"
1290,O. HENRY,"love itself. A third fortuitous adjunct was, without doubt, a chance"
1291,O. HENRY,"blow upon the projecting chin of the middleweight, under which that"
1292,O. HENRY,"warrior sank to the gully's grime and remained incapable, while"
1293,O. HENRY,Holcombe stood above him and leisurely counted him out.
1294,O. HENRY,
1295,O. HENRY,"Danny got shakily to his feet, and proved to be a true sport."
1296,O. HENRY,
1297,O. HENRY,"""You're all right,"" he said. ""But if we'd had it by rounds 'twould"
1298,O. HENRY,"have ended different. The girl goes with you, do you see? I'm on the"
1299,O. HENRY,"square."""
1300,O. HENRY,
1301,O. HENRY,They climbed back to the cottage.
1302,O. HENRY,
1303,O. HENRY,"""It's settled,"" announced Holcombe. ""Mr. Conlan removes his"
1304,O. HENRY,"objections."""
1305,O. HENRY,
1306,O. HENRY,"""That's straight,"" said Danny. ""He's all right."""
1307,O. HENRY,
1308,O. HENRY,Holcombe had only a scratched and slightly reddened chin from a
1309,O. HENRY,"vicious, glancing uppercut from Danny's left. Danny showed punishment."
1310,O. HENRY,One eye was nearly closed. His lip was bleeding.
1311,O. HENRY,
1312,O. HENRY,Katie was a true woman. Such do not at once crown the victor in the
1313,O. HENRY,tourney for their favour. Pity comes first. The victor must wait for
1314,O. HENRY,his own. It will come to him. She flew to the vanquished champion and
1315,O. HENRY,"comforted him, ministering to his bruises. Holcombe stood, serene and"
1316,O. HENRY,"smiling, without jealousy."
1317,O. HENRY,
1318,O. HENRY,"""Tomorrow,"" he said to Katie, with head erect and beaming eyes."
1319,O. HENRY,
1320,O. HENRY,"""Tomorrow, if you like,"" answered Katie."
1321,O. HENRY,
1322,O. HENRY,Holcombe minced his precarious way up the ragged hill among the
1323,O. HENRY,obsolete tinware. His car came along aglitter with electric lights and
1324,O. HENRY,jammed with passengers. He jumped to the rear platform and stood
1325,O. HENRY,"there. At his side he found Weatherly, a friend and neighbour, who had"
1326,O. HENRY,"also built a house in the suburbs, a few squares from his own."
1327,O. HENRY,
1328,O. HENRY,"""Hello, Holcombe,"" yelled Weatherly, above the crash of the car. ""Been"
1329,O. HENRY,"looking over some real estate, out here? How're Mrs. Holcombe and the"
1330,O. HENRY,"young H's?"""
1331,O. HENRY,
1332,O. HENRY,"""First rate,"" shouted Holcombe, ""when I left home this morning. How's"
1333,O. HENRY,"the family with you?"""
1334,O. HENRY,
1335,O. HENRY,"""Only so-so. Usual suburban troubles. Servants won't stay so far out;"
1336,O. HENRY,"tradesmen object to delivering goods in the country; cars break down,"
1337,O. HENRY,"etc. What's pleasing you so? Made a lucky deal today?"""
1338,O. HENRY,
1339,O. HENRY,Holcombe's face wore an ecstatic look. He was fingering a little
1340,O. HENRY,scratch on his chin with one hand. He leaned his head towards
1341,O. HENRY,Weatherly's ear.
1342,O. HENRY,
1343,O. HENRY,"""Say, Bob, do you remember that Irish girl, Katie Flynn, that was with"
1344,O. HENRY,"the Spaffords so long a time?"""
1345,O. HENRY,
1346,O. HENRY,"""I've heard of her,"" said Weatherly. ""They say she stayed a year with"
1347,O. HENRY,them without a single day off. But I don't believe any fairy story
1348,O. HENRY,"like that."""
1349,O. HENRY,
1350,O. HENRY,"""'Twas a fact. Well, I engaged her today for a cook. She's going out"
1351,O. HENRY,"to the house tomorrow."""
1352,O. HENRY,
1353,O. HENRY,"""Confound you for a lucky dog,"" shouted Weatherly, with envy in his"
1354,O. HENRY,"tones and his heart, ""and you live four blocks further out than we"
