62,PREFACE,PREFACE
63,PREFACE,
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,New editions of books are a venture for publishers rather than authors.
66,PREFACE,The author has committed his rash act once for all at the beginning and
67,PREFACE,he can hardly retract or repeat it. Nevertheless if I had not connived
68,PREFACE,and collaborated at this selection of verses written (almost all of
69,PREFACE,"them) in my younger days, they probably would not have reappeared."
70,PREFACE,"I therefore owe an apology to my best critics and friends, who have"
71,PREFACE,"always warned me that I am no poet; all the more since, in the sense in"
72,PREFACE,"which they mean the word, I heartily agree with them. Of impassioned"
73,PREFACE,"tenderness or Dionysiac frenzy I have nothing, nor even of that magic"
74,PREFACE,and pregnancy of phrasere--ally the creation of a fresh idiom--which
75,PREFACE,marks the high lights of poetry. Even if my temperament had been
76,PREFACE,"naturally warmer, the fact that the English language (and I can write"
77,PREFACE,no other with assurance) was not my mother-tongue would of itself
78,PREFACE,preclude any inspired use of it on my part; its roots do not quite
79,PREFACE,reach to my centre. I never drank in in childhood the homely cadences
80,PREFACE,and ditties which in pure spontaneous poetry set the essential key.
81,PREFACE,"I know no words redolent of the wonder-world, the fairy-tale, or the"
82,PREFACE,"cradle. Moreover, I am city-bred, and that companionship with nature,"
83,PREFACE,"those rural notes, which for English poets are almost inseparable"
84,PREFACE,"from poetic feeling, fail me altogether. Landscape to me is only a"
85,PREFACE,"background for fable or a symbol for fate, as it was to the ancients;"
86,PREFACE,and the human scene itself is but a theme for reflection. Nor have
87,PREFACE,"I been tempted into the by-ways even of towns, or fascinated by the"
88,PREFACE,aspect and humours of all sorts and conditions of men. My approach to
89,PREFACE,"language is literary, my images are only metaphors, and sometimes it"
90,PREFACE,"seems to me that I resemble my countryman Don Quixote, when in his airy"
91,PREFACE,flights he was merely perched on a high horse and a wooden Pegasus; and
92,PREFACE,I ask myself if I ever had anything to say in verse that might not have
93,PREFACE,been said better in prose.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"And yet, in reality, there was no such alternative. What I felt when"
96,PREFACE,I composed those verses could not have been rendered in any other
97,PREFACE,"form. Their sincerity is absolute, not only in respect to the thought"
98,PREFACE,"which might be abstracted from them and expressed in prose, but also"
99,PREFACE,in respect to the aura of literary and religious associations which
100,PREFACE,"envelops them. If their prosody is worn and traditional, like a"
101,PREFACE,"liturgy, it is because they represent the initiation of a mind into"
102,PREFACE,a world older and larger than itself; not the chance experiences of
103,PREFACE,"a stray individual, but his submission to what is not his chance"
104,PREFACE,experience; to the truth of nature and the moral heritage of mankind.
105,PREFACE,"Here is the uncertain hand of an apprentice, but of an apprentice in a"
106,PREFACE,great school. Verse is one of the traditions of literature. Like the
107,PREFACE,"orders of Greek architecture, the sonnet or the couplet or the quatrain"
108,PREFACE,are better than anything else that has been devised to serve the same
109,PREFACE,function; and the innate freedom of poets to hazard new forms does not
110,PREFACE,abolish the freedom of all men to adopt the old ones. It is almost
111,PREFACE,"inevitable that a man of letters, if his mind is cultivated and capable"
112,PREFACE,"of moral concentration, should versify occasionally, or should have"
113,PREFACE,"versified. He need not on that account pose as a poetic genius, and yet"
114,PREFACE,"his verses (like those of Michael Angelo, for instance) may form a"
115,PREFACE,"part, even if a subordinate part, of the expression of his mind. Poetry"
116,PREFACE,"was made for man, not man for poetry, and there are really as many"
117,PREFACE,"kinds of it as there are poets, or even verses. Is Hamlet's Soliloquy"
118,PREFACE,poetry? Would it have conveyed its meaning better if not reined in by
119,PREFACE,"the metre, and made to prance and turn to the cadences of blank verse?"
120,PREFACE,"Whether better or worse, it would certainly not be itself without"
121,PREFACE,"that movement. Versification is like a pulsing accompaniment, somehow"
122,PREFACE,sustaining and exalting the clear logic of the words. The accompaniment
123,PREFACE,"may be orchestral, but it is not necessarily worse for being thrummed"
124,PREFACE,on a mandolin or a guitar. So the couplets of Pope or Dryden need not
125,PREFACE,"be called poetry, but they could not have been prose. They frame in"
126,PREFACE,"a picture, balanced like the dance. There is an elevation, too, in"
127,PREFACE,"poetic diction, just because it is consecrated and archaic; a pomp"
128,PREFACE,"as of a religious procession, without which certain intuitions would"
129,PREFACE,lose all their grace and dignity. Borrowed plumes would not even seem
130,PREFACE,an ornament if they were not in themselves beautiful. To say that
131,PREFACE,what was good once is good no longer is to give too much importance
132,PREFACE,"to chronology. Æsthetic fashions may change, losing as much beauty"
133,PREFACE,"at one end as they gain at the other, but innate taste continues to"
134,PREFACE,"recognise its affinities, however remote, and need never change. Mask"
135,PREFACE,and buskin are often requisite in order to transport what is great in
136,PREFACE,human experience out of its embosoming littleness. They are inseparable
137,PREFACE,"from finality, from perception of the ultimate. Perhaps it is just this"
138,PREFACE,tragic finality that English poets do not have and do not relish: they
139,PREFACE,"feel it to be rhetorical. But verse after all is a form of rhetoric, as"
140,PREFACE,is all speech and even thought; a means of pouring experience into a
141,PREFACE,"mould which fluid experience cannot supply, and of transmuting emotion"
142,PREFACE,"into ideas, by making it articulate."
143,PREFACE,
144,PREFACE,"In one sense I think that my verses, mental and thin as their texture"
145,PREFACE,"may be, represent a true inspiration, a true docility. A Muse? not"
146,PREFACE,"exactly an English Muse--actually visited me in my isolation; the same,"
147,PREFACE,"or a ghost of the same, that visited Boethius or Alfred de Musset or"
148,PREFACE,Leopardi. It was literally impossible for me then not to re-echo her
149,PREFACE,"eloquence. When that compulsion ceased, I ceased to write verses. My"
150,PREFACE,emotion--for there was genuine emotion--faded into a sense that my
151,PREFACE,lesson was learned and my troth plighted; there was no longer any
152,PREFACE,occasion for this sort of breathlessness and unction. I think the
153,PREFACE,discerning reader will probably prefer the later prose versions of my
154,PREFACE,"philosophy; I prefer them myself, as being more broadly based, saner,"
155,PREFACE,more humorous. Yet if he is curious in the matter he may find the
156,PREFACE,"same thing here nearer to its fountain-head, in its accidental early"
157,PREFACE,"setting, and with its most authentic personal note."
158,PREFACE,
159,PREFACE,"For as to the subject of these poems, it is simply my philosophy"
160,PREFACE,in the making. I should not give the title of philosopher to every
161,PREFACE,"logician or psychologist who, in his official and studious moments,"
162,PREFACE,may weigh argument against argument or may devise expedients for
163,PREFACE,solving theoretical puzzles. I see no reason why a philosopher should
164,PREFACE,be puzzled. What he sees he sees; of the rest he is ignorant; and his
165,PREFACE,sense of this vast ignorance (which is his natural and inevitable
166,PREFACE,condition) is a chief part of his knowledge and of his emotion.
167,PREFACE,Philosophy is not an optional theme that may occupy him on occasion. It
168,PREFACE,"is his only possible life, his daily response to everything. He lives"
169,PREFACE,"by thinking, and his one perpetual emotion is that this world, with"
170,PREFACE,"himself in it, should be the strange world which it is. Everything"
171,PREFACE,he thinks or utters will accordingly be an integral part of his
172,PREFACE,"philosophy, whether it be called poetry or science or criticism. The"
173,PREFACE,"verses of a philosopher will be essentially epigrams, like those which"
174,PREFACE,"the Greek sages composed; they will moralise the spectacle, whether it"
175,PREFACE,be some personal passion or some larger aspect of nature.
176,PREFACE,
177,PREFACE,"My own moral philosophy, especially as expressed in this more"
178,PREFACE,"sentimental form, may not seem very robust or joyous. Its fortitude"
179,PREFACE,and happiness are those of but one type of soul. The owl hooting from
180,PREFACE,"his wintry bough cannot be chanticleer crowing in the barnyard, yet he"
181,PREFACE,"is sacred to Minerva; and the universal poet, who can sing the humours"
182,PREFACE,"of winter no less lustily than those of spring, may even speak of his"
183,PREFACE,"""merry note,"" worthy to mingle with the other pleasant accidents of the"
184,PREFACE,"somberer season,"
185,PREFACE,
186,PREFACE,"When icicles hang by the wall,"

188,PREFACE,And coughing drowns the parson's saw.
189,PREFACE,
190,PREFACE,"But whether the note seem merry or sad, musical or uncouth, it is"
191,PREFACE,"itself a note of nature; and it may at least be commended, seeing it"
192,PREFACE,"conveys a philosophy, for not conveying it by argument, but frankly"
193,PREFACE,"making confession of an actual spiritual experience, addressed only to"
194,PREFACE,"those whose ear it may strike sympathetically and who, crossing the"
195,PREFACE,"same dark wood on their own errands, may pause for a moment to listen"
196,PREFACE,gladly.

214,I,"I sought on earth a garden of delight,"
215,I,"Or island altar to the Sea and Air,"
216,I,"Where gentle music were accounted prayer,"
217,I,"And reason, veiled, performed the happy rite."
218,I,My sad youth worshipped at the piteous height
219,I,Where God vouchsafed the death of man to share;
220,I,"His love made mortal sorrow light to bear,"
221,I,But his deep wounds put joy to shamèd flight.
222,I,"And though his arms, outstretched upon the tree,"
223,I,"Were beautiful, and pleaded my embrace,"
224,I,My sins were loth to look upon his face.
225,I,"So came I down from Golgotha to thee,"
226,I,Eternal Mother; let the sun and sea
227,I,"Heal me, and keep me in thy dwelling-place."

231,II,
232,II,
233,II,"Slow and reluctant was the long descent,"
234,II,"With many farewell pious looks behind,"
235,II,"And dumb misgivings where the path might wind,"
236,II,"And questionings of nature, as I went."
237,II,"The greener branches that above me bent,"
238,II,"The broadening valleys, quieted my mind,"
239,II,To the fair reasons of the Spring inclined
240,II,And to the Summer's tender argument.
241,II,"But sometimes, as revolving night descended,"
242,II,"And in my childish heart the new song ended,"
243,II,"I lay down, full of longing, on the steep;"
244,II,"And, haunting still the lonely way I wended,"
245,II,"Into my dreams the ancient sorrow blended,"
246,II,And with these holy echoes charmed my sleep.

251,III,
252,III,"O world, thou choosest not the better part!"
253,III,"It is not wisdom to be only wise,"
254,III,"And on the inward vision close the eyes,"
255,III,But it is wisdom to believe the heart.
256,III,"Columbus found a world, and had no chart,"
257,III,Save one that faith deciphered in the skies;
258,III,To trust the soul's invincible surmise
259,III,Was all his science and his only art.
260,III,Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
261,III,That lights the pathway but one step ahead
262,III,Across a void of mystery and dread.
263,III,"Bid, then, the tender light of faith to shine"
264,III,By which alone the mortal heart is led
265,III,Unto the thinking of the thought divine.

269,IV,
270,IV,
271,IV,"I would I had been born in nature's day,"
272,IV,"When man was in the world a wide-eyed boy,"
273,IV,And clouds of sorrow crossed his sky of joy
274,IV,To scatter dewdrops on the buds of May.
275,IV,"Then could he work and love and fight and pray,"
276,IV,Nor heartsick grow in fortune's long employ.
277,IV,Mighty to build and ruthless to destroy
278,IV,"He lived, while masked death unquestioned lay."
279,IV,"Now ponder we the ruins of the years,"
280,IV,And groan beneath the weight of boasted gain;
281,IV,No unsung bacchanal can charm our ears
282,IV,"And lead our dances to the woodland fane,"
283,IV,No hope of heaven sweeten our few tears
284,IV,And hush the importunity of pain.

289,V,
290,V,"Dreamt I to-day the dream of yesternight,"
291,V,"Sleep ever feigning one evolving theme,--"
292,V,Of my two lives which should I call the dream?
293,V,Which action vanity? which vision sight?
294,V,"Some greater waking must pronounce aright,"
295,V,"If aught abideth of the things that seem,"
296,V,And with both currents swell the flooded stream
297,V,Into an ocean infinite of light.
298,V,"Even such a dream I dream, and know full well"
299,V,"My waking passeth like a midnight spell,"
300,V,But know not if my dreaming breaketh through
301,V,Into the deeps of heaven and of hell.
302,V,I know but this of all I would I knew:
303,V,"Truth is a dream, unless my dream is true."

307,VI,
308,VI,
309,VI,Love not as do the flesh-imprisoned men
310,VI,"Whose dreams are of a bitter bought caress,"
311,VI,Or even of a maiden's tenderness
312,VI,Whom they love only that she loves again.
313,VI,"For it is but thyself thou lovest then,"
314,VI,Or what thy thoughts would glory to possess;
315,VI,But love thou nothing thou wouldst love the less
316,VI,If henceforth ever hidden from thy ken.
317,VI,Love but the formless and eternal Whole
318,VI,From whose effulgence one unheeded ray
319,VI,Breaks on this prism of dissolving clay
320,VI,Into the flickering colours of thy soul.
321,VI,"These flash and vanish; bid them not to stay,"
322,VI,For wisdom brightens as they fade away.

327,VII,
328,VII,"I would I might forget that I am I,"
329,VII,"And break the heavy chain that binds me fast,"
330,VII,Whose links about myself my deeds have cast.
331,VII,What in the body's tomb doth buried lie
332,VII,"Is boundless; 'tis the spirit of the sky,"
333,VII,"Lord of the future, guardian of the past,"
334,VII,"And soon must forth, to know his own at last."
335,VII,"In his large life to live, I fain would die."
336,VII,"Happy the dumb beast, hungering for food,"
337,VII,But calling not his suffering his own;
338,VII,"Blessed the angel, gazing on all good,"
339,VII,But knowing not he sits upon a throne;
340,VII,"Wretched the mortal, pondering his mood,"
341,VII,And doomed to know his aching heart alone.

347,VIII,"O martyred Spirit of this helpless Whole,"
348,VIII,"Who dost by pain for tyranny atone,"
349,VIII,"And in the star, the atom, and the stone,"
350,VIII,"Purgest the primal guilt, and in the soul;"
351,VIII,"Rich but in grief, thou dost thy wealth unroll,"
352,VIII,"And givest of thy substance to thine own,"
353,VIII,"Mingling the love, the laughter, and the groan"
354,VIII,In the large hollow of the heaven's bowl.
355,VIII,Fill full my cup; the dregs and honeyed brim
356,VIII,"I take from thy just hand, more worthy love"
357,VIII,For sweetening not the draught for me or him.
358,VIII,"What in myself I am, that let me prove;"
359,VIII,"Relent not for my feeble prayer, nor dim"
360,VIII,The burning of thine altar for my hymn.

363,IX,IX
364,IX,
365,IX,
366,IX,Have patience; it is fit that in this wise
367,IX,The spirit purge away its proper dross.
368,IX,"No endless fever doth thy watches toss,"
369,IX,"For by excess of evil, evil dies."
370,IX,"Soon shall the faint world melt before thine eyes,"
371,IX,"And, all life's losses cancelled by life's loss,"
372,IX,"Thou shalt lay down all burdens on thy cross,"
373,IX,And be that day with God in Paradise.
374,IX,Have patience; for a long eternity
375,IX,No summons woke thee from thy happy sleep;
376,IX,For love of God one vigil thou canst keep
377,IX,And add thy drop of sorrow to the sea.
378,IX,"Having known grief, all will be well with thee,"
379,IX,"Ay, and thy second slumber will be deep."

385,X,"Have I the heart to wander on the earth,"
386,X,"So patient in her everlasting course,"
387,X,"Seeking no prize, but bowing to the force"
388,X,That gives direction and hath given birth?
389,X,"Rain tears, sweet Pity, to refresh my dearth,"
390,X,"And plough my sterile bosom, sharp Remorse,"
391,X,That I grow sick and curse my being's source
392,X,If haply one day passes lacking mirth.
393,X,"Doth the sun therefore burn, that I may bask?"
394,X,"Or do the tired earth and tireless sea,"
395,X,"That toil not for their pleasure, toil for me?"
396,X,"Amid the world's long striving, wherefore ask"
397,X,"What reasons were, or what rewards shall be?"
398,X,The covenant God gave us is a task.

404,XI,"Deem not, because you see me in the press"
405,XI,"Of this world's children run my fated race,"
406,XI,"That I blaspheme against a proffered grace,"
407,XI,Or leave unlearned the love of holiness.
408,XI,I honour not that sanctity the less
409,XI,"Whose aureole illumines not my face,"
410,XI,"But dare not tread the secret, holy place"
411,XI,To which the priest and prophet have access.
412,XI,For some are born to be beatified
413,XI,"By anguish, and by grievous penance done;"
414,XI,"And some, to furnish forth the age's pride,"
415,XI,And to be praised of men beneath the sun;
416,XI,And some are born to stand perplexed aside
417,XI,From so much sorrow--of whom I am one.

423,XII,Mightier storms than this are brewed on earth
424,XII,That pricks the crystal lake with summer showers.
425,XII,"The past hath treasure of sublimer hours,"
426,XII,And God is witness to their changeless worth.
427,XII,Big is the future with portentous birth
428,XII,"Of battles numberless, and nature's powers"
429,XII,"Outdo my dreams of beauty in the flowers,"
430,XII,And top my revels with the demons' mirth.
431,XII,"But thou, glad river that hast reached the plain,"
432,XII,Scarce wak'st the rushes to a slumberous sigh.
433,XII,"The mountains sleep behind thee, and the main"
434,XII,"Awaits thee, lulling an eternal pain"
435,XII,"With patience; nor doth Phoebe, throned on high,"

443,XIII,"Along life's labyrinthine trodden way,"
444,XIII,"With no impatience at the steep's delay,"
445,XIII,Nor sorrow at the swift-descended slope.
446,XIII,Why this inane curiosity to grope
447,XIII,In the dim dust for gems' unmeaning ray?
448,XIII,"Why this proud piety, that dares to pray"
449,XIII,For a world wider than the heaven's cope?
450,XIII,"Farewell, my burden! No more will I bear"
451,XIII,"The foolish load of my fond faith's despair,"
452,XIII,But trip the idle race with careless feet.
453,XIII,The crown of olive let another wear;

463,XIV,For mine own bosom is the paradise
464,XIV,Where all my life's fair visions are unfurled.
465,XIV,"Within my nature's shell I slumber curled,"
466,XIV,"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,"
467,XIV,"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,"
468,XIV,Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
469,XIV,I heed them not; or if the subtle night
470,XIV,"Haunt me with deities I never saw,"
471,XIV,I soon mine eyelid's drowsy curtain draw
472,XIV,To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
473,XIV,They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
474,XIV,A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.

480,XV,"A wall, a wall to hem the azure sphere,"

482,XV,"Give me but one of all the mountain rills,"
483,XV,Enough of ocean in its voice I hear.
484,XV,Come no profane insatiate mortal near
485,XV,With the contagion of his passionate ills;
486,XV,"The smoke of battle all the valleys fills,"
487,XV,Let the eternal sunlight greet me here.
488,XV,This spot is sacred to the deeper soul
489,XV,And to the piety that mocks no more.
490,XV,"In nature's inmost heart is no uproar,"
491,XV,"None in this shrine; in peace the heavens roll,"
492,XV,"In peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore,"

499,XVI,A thousand beauties that have never been
500,XVI,Haunt me with hope and tempt me to pursue;
501,XVI,"The gods, methinks, dwell just behind the blue;"
502,XVI,The satyrs at my coming fled the green.
503,XVI,The flitting shadows of the grove between
504,XVI,"The dryads' eyes were winking, and I knew"
505,XVI,The wings of sacred Eros as he flew
506,XVI,And left me to the love of things not seen.
507,XVI,"'Tis a sad love, like an eternal prayer,"
508,XVI,"And knows no keen delight, no faint surcease."
509,XVI,"Yet from the seasons hath the earth increase,"
510,XVI,And heaven shines as if the gods were there.
511,XVI,Had Dian passed there could no deeper peace

519,XVII,I flung the challenge of the spirit's right;
520,XVII,"The child, the dreamer of that visioned night,"
521,XVII,"Woke, and was humbled unto man's estate."
522,XVII,"A slave I am; on sun and moon I wait,"
523,XVII,Who heed not that I live upon their light.
524,XVII,"Me they despise, but are themselves so bright"
525,XVII,"They flood my heart with love, and quench my hate."
526,XVII,"O subtle Beauty, sweet persuasive worth"
527,XVII,"That didst the love of being first inspire,"
528,XVII,We do thee homage both in death and birth.
529,XVII,"Thirsting for thee, we die in thy great dearth,"

541,XVIII,"For love is God, and in unfathomed ways"
542,XVIII,Brings forth the beauty for which fancy pined.
543,XVIII,"I loved, and lost my love among mankind;"
544,XVIII,But I have found it after many days.
545,XVIII,"Oh, trust in God, and banish rash despair,"

547,XVIII,"My angel is come back, more sad and fair,"

665,XXIV,And my warm worship freezes into pride.
666,XXIV,But why--O waywardness of nature!--why
667,XXIV,"Seek farther in the world? I had my choice,"
668,XXIV,"And we said we were happy, you and I."
669,XXIV,"Why in the forest should I hear a cry,"

700,XXVI,"For what sin, Heaven, must I thus atone?"
701,XXVI,Was it a sin to love what seemed so fair?
702,XXVI,"If thou deny me hope, why give me care?"
703,XXVI,"I have not lived, and die alone, alone."
704,XXVI,This is not new. Many have perished so.
705,XXVI,"Long years of nothing, with some days of grief,"
706,XXVI,Made their sad life. Their own hand sought relief

891,XXXVI,"One half my soul, while the other half had fled"
892,XXXVI,Upon love's wings to heaven; and you said:

908,XXXVII,And I go by you as a cloud might go.
909,XXXVII,"You are not cruel, though you dealt the blow,"
910,XXXVII,"And I am happy, though I miss the prize;"
911,XXXVII,"For, when God tells you, you will not despise"
912,XXXVII,The love I bore you. It is better so.
913,XXXVII,"My soul is just, and thine without a stain."
914,XXXVII,"Why should not life divide us, whose division"

1383,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"That cries aloud in simple-hearted fear,"
1384,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"Curses the villain, shudders at the fray,"
1385,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,And weeps before the maiden's wreathed bier.
1386,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"Yet once familiar with the changeful show,"
1387,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"He starts no longer at a brandished knife,"
1388,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"But, his heart chastened at the sight of woe,"
1389,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,Ponders the mirrored sorrows of his life.
1390,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"So tutored too, I watch the moving art"
1391,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,Of all this magic and impassioned pain
1392,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,That tells the story of the human heart
1393,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"In a false instance, such as poets feign;"
1394,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,"I smile, and keep within the parchment furled"
1395,THE RUSTIC AT THE PLAY,That prompts the passions of this strutting world.

1414,I,Hallowed by Venus?
1415,I,
1416,I,"O for a chamber in an eastern tower,"
1417,I,"Spacious and empty, roofed in odorous cedar,"
1418,I,"A silken soft divan, a woven carpet"
1419,I,"Rich, many-coloured;"

1427,I,"Beat the slow pulses of the life eternal,"
1428,I,Bringing of nature's universal travail
1429,I,Infinite echoes;
1430,I,
1431,I,And there at even I might stand and listen
1432,I,To thrum of distant lutes and dying voices
1433,I,Chanting the ditty an Arabian captive
1434,I,Sang to Darius.
1435,I,
1436,I,"So would I dream awhile, and ease a little"

1500,III,"Brought upon blameless, river-loving nations,"
1501,III,"Cursed Spain with barren gold, and made the Andes"
1502,III,Fiefs of Saint Peter;

1513,III,
1514,III,And what good comes to us of all your dangers?
1515,III,A smaller earth and smaller hope of heaven.

1533,III,
1534,III,"Inglorious in their birth and in their living,"
1535,III,"Curious and querulous, afraid of battle,"
1536,III,"Rummaging earth for coals, in camps of hovels"
1537,III,"Crouching from winter,"
1538,III,
1539,III,"As if grim fate, amid our boastful prating,"
1540,III,"Made us the image of our brutish fathers,"
1541,III,"When from their caves they issued, crazed with terror,"
1542,III,Howling and hungry.
1543,III,
1544,III,"For all things come about in sacred cycles,"

1546,III,And now the world grows old apace; its glory
1547,III,Passes for ever.
1548,III,

1556,III,"They never can be happy, with that burden"
1557,III,"Heavy upon them,"
1558,III,
1559,III,"Knowing the hideous past, the blood, the famine,"
1560,III,"The ancestral hate, the eager faith's disaster,"
1561,III,"All ending in their little lives, and vulgar"
1562,III,Circle of troubles.
1563,III,
1564,III,"But if they have forgot us, and the shifting"
1565,III,"Of sands has buried deep our thousand cities,"
1566,III,Fell superstition then will seize upon them;
1567,III,"Protean error,"
1568,III,
1569,III,Will fill their panting heart with sickly phantoms
1570,III,Of sudden blinding good and monstrous evil;
1571,III,"There will be miracles again, and torment,"
1572,III,"Dungeon, and fagot,--"
1573,III,
1574,III,"Until the patient earth, made dry and barren,"

1606,V,
1607,V,Unseen he loved thee; for the heart within him
1608,V,"Knew earth had gardens where he might be blessed,"
1609,V,"Putting away long dreams and aimless, barbarous"
1610,V,Hunger for battle.
1611,V,
1612,V,The foretaste of thy languors thawed his bosom;
1613,V,A great need drove him to thy caverned islands

1625,V,Sister of Atlas.
1626,V,
1627,V,"He saw the luminous top of wide Olympus,"
1628,V,Fit for the happy gods; he saw the pilgrim
1629,V,"River, with rains of Ethiopia flooding"
1630,V,Populous Egypt.
1631,V,
1632,V,"And having seen, he loved thee. His racked spirit,"

1635,V,Mistress and mother.
1636,V,
1637,V,"The more should I, O fatal sea, before thee"

1694,ATHLETIC ODE,When the dank earth begins to thaw and yield
1695,ATHLETIC ODE,"The early clover, didst thou never pass"
1696,ATHLETIC ODE,Some balmy noon from field to sunny field
1697,ATHLETIC ODE,And press thy feet against the tufted grass?

1731,ATHLETIC ODE,"Cool wind-blown drops into the glassy river,"

1748,ATHLETIC ODE,And many an ardent boy
1749,ATHLETIC ODE,"Woos harsher pleasures sweeter to remember,"
1750,ATHLETIC ODE,Hugged with a sterner and a tenser joy.
1751,ATHLETIC ODE,Look where the rivals come:
1752,ATHLETIC ODE,Each little phalanx on its chosen ground
1753,ATHLETIC ODE,"Strains for the sudden shock, and all around"

1782,ATHLETIC ODE,"O wasted tear,"
1783,ATHLETIC ODE,A new soul wakes with each awakened year.
1784,ATHLETIC ODE,"Beneath these rags, these blood-clots on the face,"
1785,ATHLETIC ODE,"The valiant soul is still the same, the same"
1786,ATHLETIC ODE,"The strength, the art, the inevitable grace,"
1787,ATHLETIC ODE,The thirst unquenched for fame
1788,ATHLETIC ODE,"Quenching base passion, the high will severe,"
1789,ATHLETIC ODE,"The long obedience, and the knightly flame"
1790,ATHLETIC ODE,Of loyalty to honour and a name.

1870,PREMONITION,The muffled syllables that Nature speaks
1871,PREMONITION,Fill us with deeper longing for her word;
1872,PREMONITION,"She hides a meaning that the spirit seeks,"
1873,PREMONITION,She makes a sweeter music than is heard.
1874,PREMONITION,
1875,PREMONITION,"A hidden light illumines all our seeing,"
1876,PREMONITION,An unknown love enchants our solitude.
1877,PREMONITION,We feel and know that from the depths of being

1880,PREMONITION,Though the heart wear the garment of its sorrow
1881,PREMONITION,"And be not happy like a naked star,"

1883,PREMONITION,Some rapture from the rapture felt afar.
1884,PREMONITION,
1885,PREMONITION,Our heart strings are too coarse for Nature's fingers
1886,PREMONITION,"Deftly to quicken as she pulses on,"
1887,PREMONITION,And the harsh tremor that among them lingers
1888,PREMONITION,Will into sweeter silence die anon.
1889,PREMONITION,
1890,PREMONITION,We catch the broken prelude and suggestion
1891,PREMONITION,"Of things unuttered, needing to be sung;"

1893,PREMONITION,"Lies heavy on the heart, nor finds a tongue."

1895,PREMONITION,"Till haply, lightning through the storm of ages,"
1896,PREMONITION,"Our sullen secret flash from sky to sky,"

1911,SOLIPSISM,Perchance an exhalation of my sorrow

1945,SYBARIS,And soothe the aching of my starved sight
1946,SYBARIS,"With sheen of mirrored beauties, caught aright."
1947,SYBARIS,
1948,SYBARIS,"Here stood enchanted palaces of old,"
1949,SYBARIS,All veined porphyry and burnished gold;
1950,SYBARIS,Here matrons and slight maidens sat aloof
1951,SYBARIS,"Beneath cool porches, rich with Tyrian woof"
1952,SYBARIS,Hung from the carven rafters of the roof.
1953,SYBARIS,
1954,SYBARIS,Here in a mart a swarthy turbaned brave
1955,SYBARIS,Showed the wrought blade or praised the naked slave.
1956,SYBARIS,"""Touch with your finger-tips this edge of steel,"""
1957,SYBARIS,"Quoth he, ""and see this lad, from head to heel"

1959,SYBARIS,
1960,SYBARIS,Here Aphrodite filled with frenzied love
1961,SYBARIS,The dark recesses of her murmurous grove.
1962,SYBARIS,"The doves that haunted it, the winds that sighed,"
1963,SYBARIS,"Were souls of youths that in her coverts died,"
1964,SYBARIS,And hopes of heroes strewed her garden wide.
1965,SYBARIS,
1966,SYBARIS,Under her shades a narrow brazen gate
1967,SYBARIS,Led to the courts of Ares and of Fate.
1968,SYBARIS,Who entered breathed the unutterable prayer
1969,SYBARIS,"Of cruel hearts, and death was worshipped there,"
1970,SYBARIS,And men went thence enfranchised by despair.

1972,SYBARIS,"Here the proud athlete in the baths delayed,"
1973,SYBARIS,"While a cool fountain on his shoulders played,"
1974,SYBARIS,"Then in fine linen swathed his breast and thighs,"
1975,SYBARIS,"And silent, myrtle crowned, with serious eyes,"
1976,SYBARIS,Stepped forth to list the wranglings of the wise.
1977,SYBARIS,
1978,SYBARIS,"A sage stalked by, his ragged mantle bound"
1979,SYBARIS,About his brows; his eyes perused the ground;
1980,SYBARIS,He conned the number of the cube and square
1981,SYBARIS,Of the moon's orb; his horny feet and bare
1982,SYBARIS,Trampled the lilies carpeting the stair.
1983,SYBARIS,
1984,SYBARIS,A jasper terrace hung above the sea
1985,SYBARIS,Where the King supped with his beloved three:
1986,SYBARIS,The Libyan chanted of her native land
1987,SYBARIS,"In raucous melody, the Indian fanned,"
1988,SYBARIS,And the huge mastiff licked his master's hand.
1989,SYBARIS,
1990,SYBARIS,"Below, alone, despairing of the gale,"
1991,SYBARIS,A crouching sailor furled the saffron sail;
1992,SYBARIS,"Then rose, breathed deep, and plunged in the lagoon."
1993,SYBARIS,A mermaid spied his glistening limbs: her croon
1994,SYBARIS,Enticed him down; her cold arms choked him soon.
1995,SYBARIS,
1996,SYBARIS,"And the King laughed, filled full his jewelled bowl,"
1997,SYBARIS,"And drinking mused: ""What know we of the soul?"
1998,SYBARIS,"What magic, perfecting her harmony,"
1999,SYBARIS,"Have these red drops that so attune her key,"
2000,SYBARIS,Or those of brine that set the wretched free?
2001,SYBARIS,
2002,SYBARIS,"""If death should change me, as old fables feign,"
2003,SYBARIS,"Into some slave or beast, to purge with pain"
2004,SYBARIS,"My lordly pleasures, let my torment be"
2005,SYBARIS,"Still to behold thee, Sybaris, and see"
2006,SYBARIS,The sacred horror of thy loves and thee.
2007,SYBARIS,
2008,SYBARIS,"""Be thou my hell, my dumb eternal grief,"
2009,SYBARIS,"But spare thy King the madness of belief,"
2010,SYBARIS,The brutish faith of ignorant desire
2011,SYBARIS,That strives and wanders. Let the visible fire
2012,SYBARIS,Of beauty torture me. That doom is higher.
2013,SYBARIS,
2014,SYBARIS,"""I wear the crown of life. The rose and gem"
2015,SYBARIS,Twine with the pale gold of my diadem.
2016,SYBARIS,"Nature, long secret, hath unveiled to me"
2017,SYBARIS,And proved her vile. Her wanton bosoms be
2018,SYBARIS,"My pillow now. I know her, I am free."""
2019,SYBARIS,
2020,SYBARIS,"He spoke, and smiling stretched a languid hand,"
2021,SYBARIS,And music burst in mighty chords and bland
2022,SYBARIS,Of harp and flute and cymbal.--When between
2023,SYBARIS,"Two cypresses the large moon rose, her sheen"
2024,SYBARIS,"Silvered the nymphs' feet, tripping o'er the green."

2034,AVILA,"Realm proudly desolate and nobly poor,"
2035,AVILA,Scorched by the sky's inexorable zeal.
2036,AVILA,
2037,AVILA,Wide desert where a diadem of towers
2038,AVILA,"Above Adaja hems a silent town,"
2039,AVILA,"And locks, unmindful of the mocking hours,"
2040,AVILA,Her twenty temples in a granite crown.
2041,AVILA,
2042,AVILA,"The shafts of fervid light are in the sky,"
2043,AVILA,And in my heart the mysteries of yore.
2044,AVILA,Here the sad trophies of my spirit lie:
2045,AVILA,These dead fulfilled my destiny before.
2046,AVILA,
2047,AVILA,"Like huge primeval stones that strew this plain,"
2048,AVILA,"Their nameless sorrows sink upon my breast,"
2049,AVILA,And like this ardent sky their cancelled pain
2050,AVILA,Smiles at my grief and quiets my unrest.
2051,AVILA,
2052,AVILA,For here hath mortal life from age to age
2053,AVILA,"Endured the silent hand that makes and mars,"
2054,AVILA,"And, sighing, taken up its heritage"
2055,AVILA,Beneath the smiling and inhuman stars.
2056,AVILA,
2057,AVILA,"Still o'er this town the crested castle stands,"
2058,AVILA,"A nest for storks, as once for haughty souls,"
2059,AVILA,"Still from the abbey, where the vale expands,"
2060,AVILA,"The curfew for the long departed tolls,"
2061,AVILA,
2062,AVILA,Wafting some ghostly blessing to the heart
2063,AVILA,"From prayer of nun or silent Capuchin,"
2064,AVILA,To heal with balm of Golgotha the smart
2065,AVILA,Of weary labour and distracted sin.
2066,AVILA,
2067,AVILA,What fate has cast me on a tide of time
2068,AVILA,"Careless of joy and covetous of gold,"
2069,AVILA,What force compelled to weave the pensive rhyme
2070,AVILA,"When loves are mean, and faith and honour old,"
2071,AVILA,
2072,AVILA,"When riches crown in vain men's sordid lives,"
2073,AVILA,And learning chokes a mind of base degree?
2074,AVILA,What winged spirit rises from their hives?
2075,AVILA,"What heart, revolting, ventures to be free?"
2076,AVILA,
2077,AVILA,Their pride will sink and more ignobly fade
2078,AVILA,Without memorial of its hectic fire.
2079,AVILA,"What altars shall survive them, where they prayed?"
2080,AVILA,What lovely deities? What riven lyre?
2081,AVILA,
2082,AVILA,"Tarry not, pilgrim, but with inward gaze"
2083,AVILA,"Pass daily, musing, where their prisons are,"
2084,AVILA,And o'er the ocean of their babble raise
2085,AVILA,Thy voice in greeting to thy changeless star.
2086,AVILA,
2087,AVILA,"Abroad a tumult, and a ruin here;"
2088,AVILA,Nor world nor desert hath a home for thee.
2089,AVILA,Out of the sorrows of the barren year
2090,AVILA,Build thou thy dwelling in eternity.
2091,AVILA,
2092,AVILA,"Let patience, faith's wise sister, be thy heaven,"
2093,AVILA,And with high thoughts necessity alloy.
2094,AVILA,"Love is enough, and love is ever given,"
2095,AVILA,While fleeting days bring gift of fleeting joy.
2096,AVILA,
2097,AVILA,The little pleasures that to catch the sun
2098,AVILA,"Bubble a moment up from being's deep,"
2099,AVILA,"The glittering sands of passion as they run,"
2100,AVILA,"The merry laughter and the happy sleep,--"
2101,AVILA,
2102,AVILA,"These are the gems that, like the stars on fire,"
2103,AVILA,Encrust with glory all our heaven's zones;
2104,AVILA,"Each shining atom, in itself entire,"
2105,AVILA,"Brightens the galaxy of sister stones,"
2106,AVILA,
2107,AVILA,Dust of a world that crumbled when God's dream
2108,AVILA,"To throbbing pulses broke the life of things,"
2109,AVILA,And mingled with the void the scattered gleam
2110,AVILA,"Of many orbs that move in many rings,"
2111,AVILA,
2112,AVILA,Perchance at last into the parent sun
2113,AVILA,"To fall again and reunite their rays,"
2114,AVILA,When God awakes and gathers into one
2115,AVILA,The light of all his loves and all his days.

2132,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2133,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Not one _Ora pro nobis_ bids them pause

2144,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The little choristers may read, and mark"

2153,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"The twilight deepens, and the blood-dyed glories"
2154,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Of all these fiery blazonings are dim.

2156,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"Why should ye read them, children? Chant your hymn."
2157,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,

2208,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,There Golgotha is dark against the blue
2209,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,"In the broad east, above the painted crowd,"

2221,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,As the low lingering harmonies expire.
2222,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2223,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,In that _Amen_ are the last echoes blended
2224,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Of all the ghostly world. The shades depart

2226,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,The long delirious fever of the heart.
2227,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
2228,KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,Then I go forth into the open wold

2273,APOLLO OR A DAVID,What beauteous form beneath a marble veil
2274,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Awaited in this block the Master's hand?
2275,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Could not the magic of his art avail
2276,APOLLO OR A DAVID,To unseal that beauty's tomb and bid it stand?
2277,APOLLO OR A DAVID,
2278,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Alas! the torpid and unwilling mass
2279,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"Misknew the sweetness of the mind's control,"
2280,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"And the quick shifting of the winds, alas!"
2281,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Denied a body to that flickering soul.
2282,APOLLO OR A DAVID,
2283,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"Fair homeless spirit, harbinger of bliss,"
2284,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"It wooed dead matter that they both might live,"

2286,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"And missed the blessing heaven stooped to give,"

2289,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"Endured the gaze of Dian, till she turned"
2290,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Stung with immortal wrath and doomed to weep
2291,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Her maiden passion ignorantly spurned.

2304,APOLLO OR A DAVID,"Passed for the nonce, when a vague hand, unled,"
2305,APOLLO OR A DAVID,Half shaped the image of this lovely boy
2306,APOLLO OR A DAVID,And caught the angel's garment as he fled.

2451,I,"Locked amid hostile hills, and whispered near"

2529,II,The angels' matins sung at heaven's gate.
2530,II,Nor seemed the Virgin Mother wholly freed

2538,II,With woven lattices and pillars frail
2539,II,"He screened the pleasant secrets of his bower,"
2540,II,Yet little could his subtler arts avail
2541,II,Against the brutal onset of the Giaour.
2542,II,"The rose passed from his courts, the muezzin from his tower."

2546,II,"Allah the Great, whom silent fate obeyed,"
2547,II,"More than Jehovah calm and hidden more,"
2548,II,Allah remained in her heart's kindred core
2549,II,High witness of these terrene shifts of wrong.
2550,II,Into his ancient silence she could pour
2551,II,Her passions' frailty--He alone is strong--
2552,II,And chant with lingering wail the burden of her song.
2553,II,
2554,II,Seizing at Covadonga the rude cross
2555,II,"Pelayo raised amid his mountaineers,"
2556,II,"She bore it to Granada, one day's loss"
2557,II,Ransomed with battles of a thousand years.
2558,II,"A nation born in harness, fed on tears,"
2559,II,"Christened in blood, and schooled in sacrifice,"
2560,II,"All for a sweeter music in the spheres,"
2561,II,All for a painted heaven--at a price
2562,II,Should she forsake her loves and sail to Ind for spice?
2563,II,
2564,II,Had Genoa in her merchant palaces
2565,II,No welcome for a heaven-guided son?
2566,II,"Had Venice, mistress of the inland seas,"

2568,II,Was sated Rome content? Her mission done?
2569,II,Saw Lusitania in her seaward dreams
2570,II,"No floating premonition, beckoning on"

2579,II,Whose throne but now the thrifty Tudor stole
2580,II,Changing a noble for a crafty line?
2581,II,"Swarmed not the Norsemen yet about the pole,"
2582,II,Seeking through endless mists new havens for the soul?
2583,II,
2584,II,"These should have been thy mates, Columbus, these"
2585,II,"Patrons and partners of thy enterprise,"
2586,II,"Sad lovers of immeasurable seas,"
2587,II,"Bound to no hallowed earth, no peopled skies."
2588,II,No ray should reach them of their ladies' eyes
2589,II,"In western deserts: no pure minstrel's rhyme,"
2590,II,"Echoing in forest solitudes, surprise"
2591,II,Their heart with longing for a sweeter clime.
2592,II,"These, these should found a world who drag no chains of time."
2593,II,
2594,II,"In sooth it had seemed folly, to reveal"
2595,II,To stubborn Aragon and evil-eyed
2596,II,"These perilous hopes, folly to dull Castile"
2597,II,"Moated in jealous faith and walled in pride,"
2598,II,"Save that those thoughts, to Spain's fresh deeds allied,"
2599,II,"Painted new Christian conquests, and her hand"
2600,II,"Itched for that sword, now dangling at her side,"
2601,II,Which drove the Moslem forth and purged the land.
2602,II,And then she dreamed a dream her heart could understand.

2619,III,"No serpent's slimy coils should aught avail,"
2620,III,Till ivory cities looming in the west

2622,III,
2623,III,"Then, as with noble mien and debonair"

2625,III,Or down the temple's alabaster stair
2626,III,"Or by the river's marge of silvery sand,"

2637,III,"And, singly felling them, from their last breath"
2638,III,"Extort confession that the Lord is lord,"
2639,III,"And India's Catholic queen, Elizabeth."

2641,III,Should beat their heathen breasts and ope their treasures' hoard.
2642,III,
2643,III,"Or, if the worst should chance and high debates"
2644,III,"Should end in insult and outrageous deed,"
2645,III,"And, many Christians rudely slain, their mates"
2646,III,"Should summon heaven to their direful need,"
2647,III,Suddenly from the clouds a snow-white steed
2648,III,Bearing a dazzling rider clad in flames
2649,III,Should plunge into the fray: with instant speed

2656,III,His dearest dream: as that perchance there pined
2657,III,Some lovely maiden of angelic mind
2658,III,"In those dark towers, awaiting out of Spain"
2659,III,Two Saviours that her horoscope divined
2660,III,Should thence arrive. She (womanlike) were fain

3014,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3015,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"Only in solitude can soliloquies be appreciated, and Mr. Santayana"
3016,BY EDMUND GOSSE,is not an author for loud streets or for them who tear round the
3017,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"country in a blatant char-à-banc. He avoids even the high roads, and"
3018,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"we shall come upon him, if we are lucky, in a grassy hollow of the"
3019,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"bank of some dark river, and hear him talking to himself in a voice"
3020,BY EDMUND GOSSE,which disturbs neither the dragon-flies nor the thrushes. He meditates
3021,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"by the hour together on the sunlight in the buttercups, which gives"
3022,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"him the illusion of life, or on the hurrying flood of liquid agate,"
3023,BY EDMUND GOSSE,which reminds him of the illusion of death. Everything is a symbol to
3024,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"him, and if he has a volume of poetry open at his side he does not"
3025,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"distinguish its verse from the puzzling confidences of the blackbirds,"
3026,BY EDMUND GOSSE,and the insects are dreams which mingle with his own. The activity of
3027,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"existence is arrested for him, and time has become a vain expression."
3028,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3029,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"This is his dominant mood, but sometimes he rouses himself and walks"
3030,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"to the wayside inn, where he watches the farmers and the travellers,"
3031,BY EDMUND GOSSE,unobserved by them. He notes their ways and their talk with a shrewd
3032,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"and sometimes humorous pertinacity, but they hardly exist for him more"
3033,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"vividly than did the thrushes and the dragon-flies. All are dreams, all"
3034,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"are in a condition of _maia,_ and the more he tries to distinguish them"
3035,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"the more they melt into one. He exists, and he soliloquises, in a mood"
3036,BY EDMUND GOSSE,of perpetual reverie.
3037,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3038,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"This is an allegory, and in plain terms Mr. Santayana is a cosmopolitan"
3039,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"philosopher of wide reputation. He is the son of a gentleman of Spain,"
3040,BY EDMUND GOSSE,who emigrated to New York. He tells us that his father learned to read
3041,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"English, which implies that he never learned to speak it. The son not"
3042,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"only speaks, but writes, our language with an exquisite exactitude and"
3043,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"grace, so that he is one of those rare figures, like Mr. Conrad and"
3044,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"Mme. Mary Duclaux, who, having adopted in mature years a tongue not"
3045,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"theirs by birth, contrive not merely to master but to excel in it."
3046,BY EDMUND GOSSE,Mr. Santayana was for many years a professor of philosophy in Harvard
3047,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"University, where he showed no mercy to Hegel and was a thorn in the"
3048,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"side of the Pragmatists. He is the author of a _Life of Reason,_ in"
3049,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"five volumes, which I know that I shall never read, but which I am sure"
3050,BY EDMUND GOSSE,it is safe to recommend to persons younger and more thoughtful than
3051,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"myself. Since he ceased to be a professor, Mr. Santayana has wandered"
3052,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"much in Europe, which, distracted as it is, he prefers to America,"
3053,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"as quieter. The Great War found him at Oxford, waiting for the spark"
3054,BY EDMUND GOSSE,from heaven and meditating on the importunities of the hour. He stayed
3055,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"there, listening to the whirr of the aeroplanes over Port Meadow, and"
3056,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"admiring, perhaps not without envy, the gallant ardour of the youths"
3057,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"who started forth so bravely to arrest ""the demons of the whirlwind"""
3058,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"in France and Gallipoli. He stayed in England, because, glancing over"
3059,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"the world, he found England pre-eminently the home of decent happiness,"
3060,BY EDMUND GOSSE,even at that desolating hour.
3061,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3062,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"It is amusing to pick out here and there, and put together in a bunch,"
3063,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"some of this Hispano-American philosopher's impressions of our race,"
3064,BY EDMUND GOSSE,but we make a mistake if we suppose him largely or generally interested
3065,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"in any particular nation. What makes him attractive, but also a little"
3066,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"alarming, is his excessive detachment from the modern life in which"
3067,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"he moves so silently and observantly. He is not a social essayist,"
3068,BY EDMUND GOSSE,like Montaigne or Charles Lamb or Stevenson. He is almost obtrusively
3069,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"indifferent to whether he has an audience or not. This makes him, in"
3070,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"spite of his extreme attention to moral action, a little inhuman. I do"
3071,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"not think that he mentions the Scholar Gipsy, but he has a great deal"
3072,BY EDMUND GOSSE,of the spirit which made that hero of Matthew Arnold's beautiful poem
3073,BY EDMUND GOSSE,fly the haunts of men. Mr. Santayana will not fly too far; he will see
3074,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"""the line of festal light in Christ Church Hall,"" before he turns to the"
3075,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"woods and the wilds. But the essence of him is solitary, and he escapes"
3076,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"from society not that he may forget it, but that, removed from that"
3077,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"element in it which seems to kill the mind, he may reflect upon it with"
3078,BY EDMUND GOSSE,the minimum of disturbance.
3079,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3080,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"He is anxious to disown the name of metaphysician, but he is a"
3081,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"psychologist to the tips of his fingers, and he is still in hopes"
3082,BY EDMUND GOSSE,of discovering a scientific philosophy which may explain to him the
3083,BY EDMUND GOSSE,apparent discord between man and nature over which he is always
3084,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"brooding. His temper, excessively disturbed by recent events in the"
3085,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"political and moral history of the world, may be clearly studied in the"
3086,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"very remarkable essay called ""War Shrines,"" and again in ""Tipperary,"""
3087,BY EDMUND GOSSE,one of the most whimsical and most individual. He started life with
3088,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"a premonition of things noble and tender, and his dreams have often"
3089,BY EDMUND GOSSE,seemed to betray him. But when he has escaped from the fatiguing
3090,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"conventions of life, when he can forget the ugly side of society, his"
3091,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"old visions come back to him with smiling eyes, and he can admit that"
3092,BY EDMUND GOSSE,they have kept half their promise.
3093,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3094,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"We are so well accustomed to attacks, often very petulant and silly,"

3097,BY EDMUND GOSSE,has a much higher opinion of us than we are apt to have of ourselves.
3098,BY EDMUND GOSSE,Mr. Santayana is prompt to protest that nothing would make him wish to
3099,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"become an Englishman. His birthright was settled at his birth, and we"
3100,BY EDMUND GOSSE,feel that there is that kind of patriotism about him which if he had
3101,BY EDMUND GOSSE,been born a Mongolian would not allow him to waver in his loyalty to
3102,BY EDMUND GOSSE,Mongolia.

3104,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"But he has been a sort of Ulysses, and the result of his wanderings"
3105,BY EDMUND GOSSE,is to make him prefer the Englishman to any other human variety. This
3106,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"is decidedly gratifying, and it will amuse the desultory reader"
3107,BY EDMUND GOSSE,to skim Mr. Santayana's pages in search of his impressions of our
3108,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"race. They are not given in dogmatic form, but they are found to be"
3109,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"consistent, and, as I say, they are gratifying in the mouth of so"
3110,BY EDMUND GOSSE,shrewd and so disinterested an observer. After traversing many lands he
3111,BY EDMUND GOSSE,concludes that the English character is the best; it is as strong as
3112,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"the American, and softer, and less obstreperous. He finds the nearest"
3113,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"parallel to that old Greek temperament, which he adores, in the English"
3114,BY EDMUND GOSSE,modesty in determination. It seems to rest his spirit to see that we
3115,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"are self-sufficing. Not that he is blind to our national defects, for"
3116,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"he thinks that an exquisite or subtle Englishman, although such exist,"
3117,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"is a _lusus natures._ It is not our business to be subtle, and when we"
3118,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"are, there is always a tendency in us to become wrong-headed. We turn"
3119,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"affected or else puritanical, and these extremes are highly distasteful"
3120,BY EDMUND GOSSE,to Mr. Santayana.
3121,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3122,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"""The Englishman travels and conquers without a settled"
3123,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"design, because he has the instinct of exploration. His"
3124,BY EDMUND GOSSE,adventures are all external; they change him so little that
3125,BY EDMUND GOSSE,he is not afraid of them. He carries his English weather
3126,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"in his heart wherever he goes, and it becomes a cool spot"
3127,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"in the desert, and a steady and sane oracle amongst all"
3128,BY EDMUND GOSSE,the deliriums of mankind. Never since the heroic days of
3129,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"Greece has the world had such a sweet, just, boyish master."
3130,BY EDMUND GOSSE,It will be a black day for the human race when scientific
3131,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"blackguards, conspirators, churls, and fanatics manage to"
3132,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"supplant him."""
3133,BY EDMUND GOSSE,
3134,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"To give a general idea of Mr. Santayana's essays, I find a difficult"
3135,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"task, because of a certain density and uniformity in his expression."
3136,BY EDMUND GOSSE,He avoids the positive in all its forms. Not merely is he careful
3137,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"not to be dogmatic, but, speaking as he does to and as it were for"
3138,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"himself alone, he is apt to combine an exactitude of language with a"
3139,BY EDMUND GOSSE,considerable dilution of thought. He is not averse from the pleasant
3140,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"foible of repeating himself, and as he does this in fresh language"
3141,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"the reader, if he is at all censorious, is apt to resent a little"
3142,BY EDMUND GOSSE,the revolving flight of the ideas. Mr. Santayana soliloquises like
3143,BY EDMUND GOSSE,an aeroplane making graceful curves and daring drops in one section
3144,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"of the ether. His profound scepticism forbids him to alight, for he"
3145,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"has no faith in the current assumptions of daily life, and but a very"
3146,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"faint interest in facts. He swoops in the light like a swallow, and we"
3147,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"must be content to follow his turns and returns, with sympathy for his"
3148,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"candour and freshness, and gratitude for his gracious skill. But to"
3149,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"define what his object is, though he makes a hundred affirmations of"
3150,BY EDMUND GOSSE,"it, is not altogether easy."
