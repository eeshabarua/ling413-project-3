70,MY BROTHERS.,
71,MY BROTHERS.,_There is no star so pure and high
72,MY BROTHERS.,As was her look; no fragrance such
73,MY BROTHERS.,At her soft presence; and no sigh
74,MY BROTHERS.,Of music like her touch._

193,A FALLEN BEECH,
194,A FALLEN BEECH,
195,A FALLEN BEECH,Nevermore at doorways that are barken
196,A FALLEN BEECH,Shall the madcap wind knock and the noonlight;
197,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nor the circle, which thou once didst darken,"
198,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shine with footsteps of the neighboring moonlight,"
199,A FALLEN BEECH,Visitors for whom thou oft didst hearken.
200,A FALLEN BEECH,
201,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nevermore, gallooned with cloudy laces,"
202,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shall the morning, like a fair freebooter,"
203,A FALLEN BEECH,Make thy leaves his richest treasure-places;
204,A FALLEN BEECH,"Nor the sunset, like a royal suitor,"
205,A FALLEN BEECH,Clothe thy limbs with his imperial graces.
206,A FALLEN BEECH,
207,A FALLEN BEECH,"And no more, between the savage wonder"
208,A FALLEN BEECH,"Of the sunset and the moon's up-coming,"
209,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shall the storm, with boisterous hoof-beats, under"
210,A FALLEN BEECH,"Thy dark roof dance, Faun-like, to the humming"
211,A FALLEN BEECH,Of the Pan-pipes of the rain and thunder.
212,A FALLEN BEECH,
213,A FALLEN BEECH,"Oft the satyr spirit, beauty-drunken,"
214,A FALLEN BEECH,Of the Spring called; and the music-measure
215,A FALLEN BEECH,Of thy sap made answer; and thy sunken
216,A FALLEN BEECH,"Veins grew vehement with youth, whose pressure"
217,A FALLEN BEECH,"Swelled thy gnarly muscles, winter-shrunken."
218,A FALLEN BEECH,
219,A FALLEN BEECH,"And the germs, deep down in darkness rooted,"
220,A FALLEN BEECH,"Bubbled green from all thy million oilets,"
221,A FALLEN BEECH,"Where the spirits, rain-and-sunbeam-suited,"
222,A FALLEN BEECH,"Of the April made their whispering toilets,"
223,A FALLEN BEECH,Or within thy stately shadow footed.
224,A FALLEN BEECH,
225,A FALLEN BEECH,Oft the hours of blonde Summer tinkled
226,A FALLEN BEECH,"At the windows of thy twigs, and found thee"
227,A FALLEN BEECH,"Bird-blithe; or, with shapely bodies, twinkled"
228,A FALLEN BEECH,"Lissom feet of naked flowers around thee,"
229,A FALLEN BEECH,Where thy mats of moss lay sunbeam-sprinkled.
230,A FALLEN BEECH,
231,A FALLEN BEECH,And the Autumn with his gipsy-coated
232,A FALLEN BEECH,"Troop of days beneath thy branches rested,"
233,A FALLEN BEECH,Swarthy-faced and dark of eye; and throated
234,A FALLEN BEECH,Songs of hunting; or with red hand tested
235,A FALLEN BEECH,Every nut-bur that above him floated.
236,A FALLEN BEECH,
237,A FALLEN BEECH,"Then the Winter, barren-browed, but rich in"
238,A FALLEN BEECH,"Shaggy followers of frost and freezing,"
239,A FALLEN BEECH,"Made the floor of thy broad boughs his kitchen,"
240,A FALLEN BEECH,"Trapper-like, to camp in; grimly easing"
241,A FALLEN BEECH,Limbs snow-furred and moccasoned with lichen.
242,A FALLEN BEECH,
243,A FALLEN BEECH,"Now, alas! no more do these invest thee"
244,A FALLEN BEECH,With the dignity of whilom gladness!
245,A FALLEN BEECH,They--unto whose hearts thou once confessed thee
246,A FALLEN BEECH,Of thy dreams--now know thee not! and sadness
247,A FALLEN BEECH,Sits beside thee where forgot dost rest thee.

271,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,And crimson as a flower
272,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,Her mouth that kissed me there;
273,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"That kissed and bade me follow,"
274,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,And smiled away my care.
275,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,
276,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,A magic and a marvel
277,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"Lived in her word and look,"
278,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,As down among the blossoms
279,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"She sate me by the brook,"
280,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,And read me wonder-legends
281,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,In Nature's Story Book.
282,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,
283,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"Loved fairy-tales forgotten,"
284,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"She never reads again,"
285,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,Of beautiful enchantments
286,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"That haunt the sun and rain,"
287,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"And, in the wind and water,"
288,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,Chant a mysterious strain.
289,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,
290,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"And so I search the forest,"
291,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"Wherein my spirit feels,"
292,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,In tree or stream or flower
293,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,Herself she still conceals--
294,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,"But now she flies who followed,"
295,THE HAUNTED WOODLAND,Whom Earth no more reveals.

1759,II.,"To coax the wind, who romped among the hills"
1760,II.,"All day, a tired child, to sleep and dream:"
1761,II.,When through the moonlight of the locust-lane

1766,III.,
1767,III.,White as a lily molded of Earth's milk
1768,III.,That eve the moon swam in a hyacinth sky;
1769,III.,"Soft in the gleaming glens the wind went by,"
1770,III.,Faint as a phantom clothed in unseen silk:
1771,III.,"Bright as a naiad's leap, from shine to shade,"
1772,III.,The runnel twinkled through the shaken brier;
1773,III.,"Above the hills one long cloud, pulsed with fire,"
1774,III.,"Flashed like a great, enchantment-welded blade."
1775,III.,"And when the western sky seemed some weird land,"
1776,III.,And night a witching spell at whose command
1777,III.,One sloping star fell green from heav'n; and deep
1778,III.,The warm rose opened for the moth to sleep;
1779,III.,"Then she, consenting, laid her hands in his,"
1780,III.,And lifted up her lips for their first kiss.

1787,IV.,Athwart the porch the shadow of a pine
1788,IV.,"Cleaves the white moonlight; and, like some calm rune"
1789,IV.,"Heaven says to Earth, shines the majestic moon;"
1790,IV.,And now a meteor draws a lilac line
1791,IV.,"Across the welkin, as if God would sign"
1792,IV.,The perfect poem of this night of June.
1793,IV.,"The wood-wind stirs the flowering chestnut-tree,"
1794,IV.,Whose curving blossoms strew the glimmering grass
1795,IV.,Like crescents that wind-wrinkled waters glass;
1796,IV.,"And, like a moonstone in a frill of flame,"
1797,IV.,"The dew-drop trembles on the peony,"

1807,V.,"And, in her soul, persuading still in vain,"
1808,V.,"Shall doubt take shape, and all its old surmise"
1809,V.,Bid darker phantoms of remorse arise
1810,V.,Trailing the raiment of a dead disdain?
1811,V.,"Masks, unto whom shall her avowal yearn,"
1812,V.,With looks clairvoyant seeing how each is
1813,V.,"A different form, with eyes and lips that burn"
1814,V.,Into her heart with love's last look and kiss?--

1824,VI.,As her bright smile to cheer the world below?
1825,VI.,Nor had the conscious twilight's golds and grays
1826,VI.,"Her soul's allurement, that was free of blame,--"
1827,VI.,"Nor dusk's gold canvas, where one star's white flame"
1828,VI.,"Shone, more bewitchment than her own sweet ways.--"
1829,VI.,"Then as the night with moonlight and perfume,"
1830,VI.,"And dew and darkness, qualifies the whole"
1831,VI.,"Dim world with glamour, shall the past with dreams--"

1842,VII.,"Both, though apart, before no blown-out light."
1843,VII.,"The otherwise of fate for them, when white"
1844,VII.,"The lilacs bloom again, and, innocent,"
1845,VII.,"Spring comes with beauty for her testament,"
1846,VII.,Singing the praises of the day and night.
1847,VII.,When orchards blossom and the distant hill
1848,VII.,"Is vague with haw-trees as a ridge with mist,"
1849,VII.,The moon shall see him where a watch he keeps
1850,VII.,"By her young form that lieth white and still,"

1960,III.,While all the dark inanimate
1961,III.,Of nature woke; initiate
1962,III.,"With th' moon's arrival, something ceased"
1963,III.,In nature's soul; she stood again
1964,III.,"Another self, that seemed t' have been"
1965,III.,"Dormant, suppressed and so unseen"

2078,VII.,"Many an unknown Indian myth,"

2080,VII.,Like an hospitable hand

2090,VII.,Out of silence; and the tune

2092,VII.,Round a moonlit bend in sight of
2093,VII.,Some lone landing heaped with hay
2094,VII.,Or tobacco; where the light of
2095,VII.,One dim solitary lamp
2096,VII.,Signaled through the evening's damp:
2097,VII.,"Then a bell; and, dusky gray,"

2100,VII.,On the gang-plank; backs and arms
2101,VII.,With their cargo bending o'er;
2102,VII.,And the burly mate before.
2103,VII.,"Then an iron bell, and puff"
2104,VII.,Of escaping steam; and out
2105,VII.,Where the stream is wheel-whipped rough;
2106,VII.,"Music, and a parting shout"
2107,VII.,From the shore; the pilot's bell

2238,XI.,"Cool and easy on my cheek,"
2239,XI.,And your breath's aroma: bare
2240,XI.,"Hand upon my arm, as weak"
2241,XI.,As a lily on a stream:
2242,XI.,"And your eyes, that gaze at me"
2243,XI.,"With the sometime witchery,"
2244,XI.,To my inmost spirit speak.
2245,XI.,And remembered ecstacy
2246,XI.,Sweeps my soul again ... I seem
2247,XI.,"Dreaming, yet I do not dream."
2248,XI.,
2249,XI.,
2250,XII.,XII.
2251,XII.,
2252,XII.,"When day dies, lone, forsaken,"
2253,XII.,And joy is kissed asleep;
2254,XII.,"When doubt's gray eyes awaken,"
2255,XII.,"And love, with music taken"
2256,XII.,"From hearts with sighings shaken,"
2257,XII.,Sits in the dusk to weep:
2258,XII.,
2259,XII.,With ghostly lifted finger
2260,XII.,What memory then shall rise?--
2261,XII.,Of dark regret the bringer--
2262,XII.,To tell the sorrowing singer
2263,XII.,"Of days whose echoes linger,"
2264,XII.,Till dawn unstars the skies.
2265,XII.,
2266,XII.,"When night is gone and, beaming,"
2267,XII.,Faith journeys forth to toil;
2268,XII.,"When hope's blue eyes wake gleaming,"
2269,XII.,And life is done with dreaming
2270,XII.,"The dreams that seem but seeming,"
2271,XII.,Within the world's turmoil:
2272,XII.,
2273,XII.,Can we forget the presence
2274,XII.,Of death who walks unseen?
2275,XII.,Whose scythe casts shadowy crescents
2276,XII.,"Around life's glittering essence,"
2277,XII.,"As lessens, slowly lessens,"
2278,XII.,The space that lies between.
2279,XII.,
2280,XII.,

2282,XIII.,
2283,XIII.,"Bland was that October day,"
2284,XIII.,"Calm and balmy as the spring,"
2285,XIII.,"When we went a forest-way,"
2286,XIII.,"'Neath paternal beeches gray,"
2287,XIII.,To a valleyed opening:
2288,XIII.,"Where the purple aster flowered,"
2289,XIII.,"And, like torches shadow-held,"
2290,XIII.,Red the fiery sumach towered;
2291,XIII.,"And, where gum-trees sentineled"
2292,XIII.,"Vistas, robed in gold and garnet,"
2293,XIII.,Ripe the thorny chestnut shelled
2294,XIII.,Its brown plumpness. Bee and hornet
2295,XIII.,"Droned around us; quick the cricket,"
2296,XIII.,"Tireless in the wood-rose thicket,"
2297,XIII.,"Tremoloed; and, to the wind"
2298,XIII.,"All its moon-spun silver casting,"
2299,XIII.,Swung the milk-weed pod unthinned;
2300,XIII.,"And, its clean flame on the sod"
2301,XIII.,"By the fading golden-rod,"
2302,XIII.,Burned the white life-everlasting.
2303,XIII.,"It was not so much the time,"
2304,XIII.,"Nor the place, nor way we went,"
2305,XIII.,"That made all our moods to rhyme,"
2306,XIII.,"Nor the season's sentiment,"
2307,XIII.,As it was the innocent
2308,XIII.,"Carefree childhood of our hearts,"
2309,XIII.,Reading each expression of
2310,XIII.,Death and care as life and love:
2311,XIII.,That impression joy imparts
2312,XIII.,Unto others and retorts
2313,XIII.,"On itself, which then made glad"
2314,XIII.,"All the sorrow of decay,"
2315,XIII.,As the memory of that day
2316,XIII.,"Makes this day of spring, now, sad."
2317,XIII.,
2318,XIII.,
2319,XIV.,XIV.
2320,XIV.,
2321,XIV.,The balsam-breathed petunias
2322,XIV.,Hang riven of the rain;
2323,XIV.,And where the tiger-lily was
2324,XIV.,Now droops a tawny stain;
2325,XIV.,While in the twilight's purple pause
2326,XIV.,Earth dreams of Heaven again.
2327,XIV.,
2328,XIV.,"When one shall sit and sigh,"
2329,XIV.,And one lie all alone
2330,XIV.,Beneath the unseen sky--
2331,XIV.,Whose love shall then deny?
2332,XIV.,Whose love atone?
2333,XIV.,
2334,XIV.,With ragged petals round its pod
2335,XIV.,The rain-wrecked poppy dies;
2336,XIV.,And where the hectic rose did nod
2337,XIV.,A crumbled crimson lies;
2338,XIV.,While distant as the dreams of God
2339,XIV.,The stars slip in the skies.
2340,XIV.,
2341,XIV.,"When one shall lie asleep,"
2342,XIV.,And one be dead and gone--
2343,XIV.,"Within the unknown deep,"
2344,XIV.,Shall we the trysts then keep
2345,XIV.,That now are done?

2352,XV.,"While, outside, the boisterous weather"
2353,XV.,Hung the wild wind on the pine
2354,XV.,"Like a black marauder, and"
2355,XV.,With a sudden warning hand
2356,XV.,At the casement rapped. The night
2357,XV.,"Read no sentiment of light,"
2358,XV.,"Starbeam-syllabled, within"
2359,XV.,"Her romance of death and sin,"
2360,XV.,Shadow-chaptered tragicly.--
2361,XV.,"Looking in your eyes, ah me!"
2362,XV.,"Though I heard, I did not heed"
2363,XV.,"What the night read unto us,"
2364,XV.,Threatening and ominous:
2365,XV.,For love helped my heart to read
2366,XV.,Forward through unopened pages
2367,XV.,"To a coming day, that held"
2368,XV.,More for us than all the ages
2369,XV.,"Past, that it epitomized"
2370,XV.,In its sentence; where we spelled
2371,XV.,What our present realized
2372,XV.,Only--all the love that was
2373,XV.,Past and yet to be for us.
2374,XV.,
2375,XV.,

2381,XVI.,"No more to sigh or sing,"
2382,XVI.,"Yet go we back the ways we knew,"
2383,XVI.,When buds were opening.
2384,XVI.,
2385,XVI.,Perhaps we shall not search in vain
2386,XVI.,Within its wreck and gloom;
2387,XVI.,'Mid roses ruined of the rain
2388,XVI.,There still may live one bloom;
2389,XVI.,"One flower, whose heart may still retain"
2390,XVI.,The long-lost soul-perfume.
2391,XVI.,
2392,XVI.,"And then, perhaps, will come to us"
2393,XVI.,The dreams we dreamed before;
2394,XVI.,"And song, who spoke so beauteous,"
2395,XVI.,Will speak to us once more;
2396,XVI.,"And love, with eyes all amorous,"
2397,XVI.,Will ope again his door.
2398,XVI.,
2399,XVI.,"So 'though the garden's gray with dew,"
2400,XVI.,"And flowers are withering,"
2401,XVI.,"And there's no more to say or do,"
2402,XVI.,"No more to sigh or sing,"

2405,XVI.,
2406,XVI.,
2407,XVII.,XVII.
2408,XVII.,
2409,XVII.,"Looking on the desolate street,"
2410,XVII.,"Where the March snow drifts and drives,"
2411,XVII.,"Trodden black of hurrying feet,"
2412,XVII.,Where the athlete storm-wind strives
2413,XVII.,"With each tree and dangling light,--"
2414,XVII.,"Centers, sphered with glittering white,--"
2415,XVII.,Hissing in the dancing snow ...
2416,XVII.,Backward in my soul I go
2417,XVII.,To that tempest-haunted night
2418,XVII.,"Of two autumns past, when we,"
2419,XVII.,"Hastening homeward, were o'ertaken"
2420,XVII.,"Of the storm; and 'neath a tree,"
2421,XVII.,"With its wild leaves whisper-shaken,"
2422,XVII.,"Sheltered us in that forsaken,"
2423,XVII.,"Sad and ancient cemetery,--"
2424,XVII.,Where folk came no more to bury.--
2425,XVII.,"Haggard grave-stones, mossed and crumbled,"
2426,XVII.,"Tottered 'round us, or o'ertumbled"
2427,XVII.,"In their sunken graves; and some,"
2428,XVII.,Urned and obelisked above
2429,XVII.,"Iron-fenced in tombs, stood dumb"
2430,XVII.,Records of forgotten love.
2431,XVII.,And again I see the west
2432,XVII.,Yawning inward to its core
2433,XVII.,"Of electric-spasmed ore,"
2434,XVII.,"Swiftly, without pause or rest."
2435,XVII.,And a great wind sweeps the dust
2436,XVII.,"Up abandoned sidewalks; and,"
2437,XVII.,"In the rotting trees, the gust"
2438,XVII.,Shouts again--a voice that would
2439,XVII.,Make its gaunt self understood
2440,XVII.,Moaning over death's lean land.
2441,XVII.,"And we sat there, hand in hand;"
2442,XVII.,"On the granite; where we read,"
2443,XVII.,"By the leaping skies o'erhead,"
2444,XVII.,Something of one young and dead.
2445,XVII.,Yet the words begot no fear
2446,XVII.,In our souls: you leaned your cheek
2447,XVII.,Smiling on mine: very near
2448,XVII.,Were our lips: we did not speak.
2449,XVII.,
2450,XVII.,
2451,XVIII.,XVIII.
2452,XVIII.,
2453,XVIII.,And suddenly alone I stood
2454,XVIII.,With scared eyes gazing through the wood.
2455,XVIII.,"For some still sign of ill or good,"
2456,XVIII.,To lead me from the solitude.
2457,XVIII.,
2458,XVIII.,The day was at its twilighting;
2459,XVIII.,One cloud o'erhead spread a vast wing
2460,XVIII.,Of rosy thunder; vanishing
2461,XVIII.,Above the far hills' mystic ring.
2462,XVIII.,
2463,XVIII.,Some stars shone timidly o'erhead;
2464,XVIII.,And toward the west's cadaverous red--
2465,XVIII.,Like some wild dream that haunts the dead
2466,XVIII.,In limbo--the lean moon was led.
2467,XVIII.,
2468,XVIII.,"Upon the sad, debatable"
2469,XVIII.,Vague lands of twilight slowly fell
2470,XVIII.,"A silence that I knew too well,"
2471,XVIII.,A sorrow that I can not tell.
2472,XVIII.,
2473,XVIII.,"What way to take, what path to go,"
2474,XVIII.,"Whether into the east's gray glow,"
2475,XVIII.,Or where the west burnt red and low--
2476,XVIII.,"What road to choose, I did not know."
2477,XVIII.,
2478,XVIII.,"So, hesitating, there I stood"
2479,XVIII.,Lost in my soul's uncertain wood:
2480,XVIII.,"One sign I craved of ill or good,"
2481,XVIII.,To lead me from its solitude.
2482,XVIII.,
2483,XVIII.,
2484,XIX.,XIX.
2485,XIX.,
2486,XIX.,"It was autumn: and a night,"
2487,XIX.,"Full of whispers and of mist,"
2488,XIX.,"With a gray moon, wanly whist,"
2489,XIX.,Hanging like a phantom light
2490,XIX.,O'er the hills. We stood among
2491,XIX.,"Windy fields of weed and flower,"
2492,XIX.,"Where the withered seed pod hung,"
2493,XIX.,And the chill leaf-crickets sung.
2494,XIX.,Melancholy was the hour
2495,XIX.,With the mystery and loneness
2496,XIX.,"Of the year, that seemed to look"
2497,XIX.,On its own departed face;
2498,XIX.,"As our love then, in its oneness,"
2499,XIX.,"All its dead past did retrace,"
2500,XIX.,And from that sad moment took
2501,XIX.,Presage of approaching parting.--
2502,XIX.,Sorrowful the hour and dark:
2503,XIX.,"Low among the trees, now starting,"
2504,XIX.,"Now concealed, a star's pale spark--"
2505,XIX.,Like a fen-fire--winked and lured
2506,XIX.,On to shuddering shadows; where
2507,XIX.,"All was doubtful, unassured,"
2508,XIX.,Immaterial; and the bare
2509,XIX.,Facts of unideal day
2510,XIX.,Changed to substance such as dreams.
2511,XIX.,"And meseemed then, far away--"
2512,XIX.,Farther than remotest gleams
2513,XIX.,"Of the stars--lost, separated,"
2514,XIX.,"And estranged, and out of reach,"
2515,XIX.,"Grew our lives away from each,"
2516,XIX.,"Loving lives, that long had waited."
2517,XIX.,
2518,XIX.,
2519,XX.,XX.
2520,XX.,
2521,XX.,There is no gladness in the day
2522,XX.,Now you're away;
2523,XX.,"Dull is the morn, the noon is dull,"
2524,XX.,Once beautiful;
2525,XX.,And when the evening fills the skies
2526,XX.,"With dusky dyes,"
2527,XX.,With tired eyes and tired heart
2528,XX.,"I sit alone, I sigh apart,"
2529,XX.,And wish for you.
2530,XX.,
2531,XX.,Ah! darker now the night comes on
2532,XX.,Since you are gone;
2533,XX.,"Sad are the stars, the moon is sad,"
2534,XX.,Once wholly glad;
2535,XX.,"And when the stars and moon are set,"
2536,XX.,"And earth lies wet,"
2537,XX.,"With heart's regret and soul's hard ache,"
2538,XX.,"I dream alone, I lie awake,"
2539,XX.,And wish for you.
2540,XX.,
2541,XX.,"These who once spake me, speak no more,"
2542,XX.,Now all is o'er;
2543,XX.,Day hath forgot the language of
2544,XX.,Its hopes of love;
2545,XX.,"Night, whose sweet lips were burdensome"
2546,XX.,"With dreams, is dumb;"
2547,XX.,"Far different from what used to be,"
2548,XX.,With silence and despondency
2549,XX.,They speak to me.
2550,XX.,
2551,XX.,
2552,XXI.,XXI.
2553,XXI.,
2554,XXI.,So it ends--the path that crept
2555,XXI.,Through a land all slumber-kissed;
2556,XXI.,Where the sickly moonlight slept
2557,XXI.,Like a pale antagonist.
2558,XXI.,"Now the star, that led us onward,--"
2559,XXI.,"Reassuring with its light,--"
2560,XXI.,Fails and falters; dipping downward
2561,XXI.,"Leaves us wandering in night,"
2562,XXI.,With old doubts we once disdained ...
2563,XXI.,So it ends. The woods attained--
2564,XXI.,Where our heart's desire builded
2565,XXI.,"A fair temple, fire-gilded,"
2566,XXI.,"With hope's marble shrine within,"
2567,XXI.,Where the lineaments of our love
2568,XXI.,"Shone, with lilies clad and crowned,"
2569,XXI.,'Neath white columns reared above
2570,XXI.,"Sorrow and her sister sin,"
2571,XXI.,"Columns, rose and ribbon-wound,--"
2572,XXI.,In the forest we have found
2573,XXI.,But a ruin! All around
2574,XXI.,"Lie the shattered capitals,"
2575,XXI.,And vast fragments of the walls ...
2576,XXI.,"Like a climbing cloud,--that plies,"
2577,XXI.,"Wind-wrecked, o'er the moon that lies"
2578,XXI.,"'Neath its blackness,--taking on"
2579,XXI.,"Gradual certainties of wan,"
2580,XXI.,"Soft assaults of easy white,"
2581,XXI.,Pale-approaching; till the skies'
2582,XXI.,Emptiness and hungry night
2583,XXI.,"Claim its bulk again, while she"
2584,XXI.,Rides in lonely purity:
2585,XXI.,"So we found our temple, broken,"
2586,XXI.,And a musing moment's space
2587,XXI.,"Love, whose latest word was spoken,"
2588,XXI.,"Seemed to meet us face to face,"
2589,XXI.,Making bright that ruined place
2590,XXI.,With a strange effulgence; then
2591,XXI.,"Passed, and left all black again."
