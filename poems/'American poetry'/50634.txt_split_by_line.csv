242,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,—’Twas only that we needed something more;
243,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,Some note rang wrong;
244,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"A foolish fancy, may be, but still strong,"
245,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,That life sang sweeter snatched between the green

256,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"And so what wonder, Life, that you and I,"
257,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"Shut out from such glad confidence, should miss"
258,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,And grieve for this.
259,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,

266,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"O generous-natured, friendly, neighbor tree!"
267,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,Weave gentle blessings in the shade and shine;
268,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"And granting gracious patience to my plea,"
269,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"Some simple lesson of your lore make mine,"
270,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"Make mine, I pray!"
271,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"O, be a kindly teacher unto me,"
272,_AMONG THE TREES AGAIN_,"And I’ll pour out such worshipful heart-wine,"

711,_A PLEA_,When on the barren sea you sailed away.
712,_A PLEA_,"The peach-trees then were in a rosy glow,"
713,_A PLEA_,"And down below,"
714,_A PLEA_,The tulip buds had just begun to show.
715,_A PLEA_,"—And yet, dear heart, I know"
716,_A PLEA_,"Though all the heaven smiled in tender blue,"
717,_A PLEA_,It shone not so to you.
718,_A PLEA_,"Sorrow had hooded all your skies in gray,"
719,_A PLEA_,"And when these dancing boughs put on their gay,"
720,_A PLEA_,"Bright May-time bravery, they only grieved"
721,_A PLEA_,A heart bereaved.
722,_A PLEA_,"And though glad robins sang to you to stay,"
723,_A PLEA_,And by the stream the first sweet-flags unfurled
724,_A PLEA_,"Seemed nature’s truce to sorrow,—every way"

727,_A PLEA_,
728,_A PLEA_,"Ah, well do I remember how my prayers"
729,_A PLEA_,"Went with you, dear, and followed unawares;"
730,_A PLEA_,"So speeding ever, winging far and wide"
731,_A PLEA_,"About the path wherein your ship should ride,"
732,_A PLEA_,And pleading Heaven that most gentle airs
733,_A PLEA_,And tempered tide
734,_A PLEA_,Might bear you safely to the farther side.
735,_A PLEA_,
736,_A PLEA_,"Then, when I knew your voyage over,—then,"
737,_A PLEA_,"—For surely now, at last, I may confess,"

741,_A PLEA_,"Yes, jealousy it was! not any less,"
742,_A PLEA_,That constantly
743,_A PLEA_,Wrapped all my thoughts of you beyond the sea!—
744,_A PLEA_,"I feared lest other lives, more large and wide"
745,_A PLEA_,"Than mine has been, might, day by day, divide"
746,_A PLEA_,And win your life and love away from me.
747,_A PLEA_,"And I was fearful for dear nature, too;"
748,_A PLEA_,I could not bear
749,_A PLEA_,To think that heaven anywhere should wear
750,_A PLEA_,"A hue more deeply, more divinely blue"
751,_A PLEA_,Than this home sky that we together knew;
752,_A PLEA_,Or that there grew
753,_A PLEA_,Strange bud or bloom to make the earth more fair.
754,_A PLEA_,"—A most unworthy fancy, it is true;"
755,_A PLEA_,"Since nature is but nature everywhere,"
756,_A PLEA_,"The same kind mother, in whatever land;"
757,_A PLEA_,"So too, maybe, could we but understand,"
758,_A PLEA_,All hearts and loves are only as a part
759,_A PLEA_,Of one great Heart
760,_A PLEA_,Whose universal pulses so expand
761,_A PLEA_,That any lesser life that therein beats
762,_A PLEA_,Should no more dream of this word “jealousy”
763,_A PLEA_,Than yonder shining flakes of bloom should be
764,_A PLEA_,"Jealous, forsooth, of the whole hawthorn tree"
765,_A PLEA_,That is but one with their own mass of sweets.
766,_A PLEA_,"And so, at last, through blind, unreasoning grief"
767,_A PLEA_,"Beyond belief,"
768,_A PLEA_,Brightly within my heart there did uprise
769,_A PLEA_,"Love’s loyalty, rebuking in this wise:"
770,_A PLEA_,"“Has she not spoken, oft and oft again,"
771,_A PLEA_,"These three plain words ‘I love you’? Wherefore, then,"
772,_A PLEA_,What right have you
773,_A PLEA_,To deem mere distance could her love undo?
774,_A PLEA_,To fancy aught exists that could estrange
775,_A PLEA_,"Her heart from yours, wherein there is no change,"
776,_A PLEA_,Or judge her own to be less simply true?”
777,_A PLEA_,
778,_A PLEA_,"And then, in shame, I swiftly put aside"

780,_A PLEA_,"In trust as pure, as boundless, and as wide"
781,_A PLEA_,"As still sea-deeps, unvexed of any tide."
782,_A PLEA_,"Nay, I have learned to cherish rightly, too,"
783,_A PLEA_,All light and life that minister to you.
784,_A PLEA_,I hold most dear
785,_A PLEA_,Whatever least thing brings you smallest cheer;
786,_A PLEA_,"And, day by day, my ceaseless prayer is this,"
787,_A PLEA_,"That from the changeful, many-colored grace"
788,_A PLEA_,"Of time and place,"
789,_A PLEA_,Your grief may come to weave a chrysalis
790,_A PLEA_,"Round its dead hopes, till waking, by and by,"
791,_A PLEA_,It shall find wings to bear it to the sky.
792,_A PLEA_,"—But, dear,—God knows I would not do you wrong,"
793,_A PLEA_,"Nor touch one heart-string if it be not strong,—"
794,_A PLEA_,"But O, so long,"
795,_A PLEA_,So long it seems! You have been gone so long!
796,_A PLEA_,"The feather-grass is growing green and high,"
797,_A PLEA_,"And, piping gaily in an azure throng,"
798,_A PLEA_,The bluebirds spangle all the air with song;
799,_A PLEA_,Again aflame the rosy peach boughs burn;
800,_A PLEA_,"—Can not you, too, return?"
801,_A PLEA_,
802,_A PLEA_,"On slender stems the nodding wind-flowers blow,"
803,_A PLEA_,And bloodroots grow
804,_A PLEA_,Where high the hedges fling their lacing frets
805,_A PLEA_,"Along the lanes; while, softly sifting through"
806,_A PLEA_,"Tall plumy weeds and silver spider-nets,"
807,_A PLEA_,The yellow sunbeams filter down below
808,_A PLEA_,Until I know
809,_A PLEA_,Not any fair Italian sky is blue
810,_A PLEA_,As is our earth to-day with violets!
811,_A PLEA_,Nor do I think that even that Syrian sun
812,_A PLEA_,"You watched ride high above Damascus’ towers,"
813,_A PLEA_,In purer light or richer splendor glowed
814,_A PLEA_,Than any one
815,_A PLEA_,Of these most lovely golden dawns of ours
816,_A PLEA_,That wake the birds along the river road.
817,_A PLEA_,The green ravines are newly fringed with fern;
818,_A PLEA_,From out the brake a robin red-breast calls;
819,_A PLEA_,"The stream repeats, at rippling intervals,"
820,_A PLEA_,“Can you not now return?”
821,_A PLEA_,
822,_A PLEA_,But what avail in striving to compare
823,_A PLEA_,"Earth’s endless beauties, whether east or west!"
824,_A PLEA_,"All lands are lovely, and I am aware"
825,_A PLEA_,"That unto me this little spot seems fair,"
826,_A PLEA_,More rare
827,_A PLEA_,"Than all the gathered glories of the rest,"
828,_A PLEA_,Because I love it best.
829,_A PLEA_,"And so, in truth, I feel that chief I plead"
830,_A PLEA_,A selfish need;
831,_A PLEA_,"I too, like nature, long to greet the spring!"
832,_A PLEA_,"Indeed I think I never have confessed,"
833,_A PLEA_,Nor have you guessed
834,_A PLEA_,How much of May it is your gift to bring.
835,_A PLEA_,You never knew how wintry was the cloud
836,_A PLEA_,"Of haunting sadness, that would ofttimes shroud"
837,_A PLEA_,"My inmost being, and creep up to chill"
838,_A PLEA_,"The warmer currents of my life,—until,"
839,_A PLEA_,"In knowing you,"
840,_A PLEA_,"I felt a pulse like that sweet, joyous thrill"
841,_A PLEA_,That breaks the buds when all the skies are blue!
842,_A PLEA_,The bitter storms of grief I did not fear
843,_A PLEA_,When you were near.
844,_A PLEA_,But sometimes now I have grown half afraid
845,_A PLEA_,That unforgotten frost of pain that used
846,_A PLEA_,To wrap my nature will again invade
847,_A PLEA_,The singing streams your April touch had loosed.
848,_A PLEA_,"Spring’s subtler spells alone I can not learn,"
849,_A PLEA_,"—Ah, will you not return?"
850,_A PLEA_,
851,_A PLEA_,Yet if it chance that prayed-for peace you sought
852,_A PLEA_,"Be not at length to full perfection wrought,"
853,_A PLEA_,If still in vain
854,_A PLEA_,"Time strives with memory,—then, dear, I would fain"
855,_A PLEA_,Let be as naught
856,_A PLEA_,All I have uttered; and I will refrain
857,_A PLEA_,"From any whispered wish, or word, or thought,"
858,_A PLEA_,That might to you in anywise complain.
859,_A PLEA_,"However much my eager heart may miss,"
860,_A PLEA_,"How much for you my very soul may yearn,"
861,_A PLEA_,"I will seek patience, confident in this,"
862,_A PLEA_,"That some time, surely, Love shall conquer pain,"

880,_SEA-DREAMS_,

889,_SEA-DREAMS_,A shining vision rise.
890,_SEA-DREAMS_,
891,_SEA-DREAMS_,"It seemed a ghostly castle white,"
892,_SEA-DREAMS_,"With battlement and tower,"
893,_SEA-DREAMS_,That hung on the horizon’s verge
894,_SEA-DREAMS_,By some unearthly power.
895,_SEA-DREAMS_,
896,_SEA-DREAMS_,I saw its spectral turrets gleam
897,_SEA-DREAMS_,"As white as ivory,"
