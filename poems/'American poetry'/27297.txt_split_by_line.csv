108,PATH FLOWER,"A lark o'er Golder's lane,"
109,PATH FLOWER,As I the April pathway trod
110,PATH FLOWER,Bound west for Willesden.
111,PATH FLOWER,
112,PATH FLOWER,At foot each tiny blade grew big
113,PATH FLOWER,"And taller stood to hear,"
114,PATH FLOWER,And every leaf on every twig
115,PATH FLOWER,Was like a little ear.
116,PATH FLOWER,
117,PATH FLOWER,"As I too paused, and both ways tried"
118,PATH FLOWER,"To catch the rippling rain,--"
119,PATH FLOWER,"So still, a hare kept at my side"
120,PATH FLOWER,"His tussock of disdain,--"
121,PATH FLOWER,
122,PATH FLOWER,"Behind me close I heard a step,"
123,PATH FLOWER,"A soft pit-pat surprise,"
124,PATH FLOWER,And looking round my eyes fell deep
125,PATH FLOWER,Into sweet other eyes;
126,PATH FLOWER,
127,PATH FLOWER,"The eyes like wells, where sun lies too,"
128,PATH FLOWER,"So clear and trustful brown,"

137,PATH FLOWER,"""So long a tramp?"" Two gentle nods,"
138,PATH FLOWER,"Then seemed to lift a wing,"
139,PATH FLOWER,"And words fell soft as willow-buds,"
140,PATH FLOWER,"""I came to find the Spring."""
141,PATH FLOWER,
142,PATH FLOWER,"A timid voice, yet not afraid"
143,PATH FLOWER,"In ways so sweet to roam,"
144,PATH FLOWER,As it with honey bees had played
145,PATH FLOWER,And could no more go home.
146,PATH FLOWER,
147,PATH FLOWER,"Her home! I saw the human lair,"
148,PATH FLOWER,"I heard the hucksters bawl,"
149,PATH FLOWER,I stifled with the thickened air
150,PATH FLOWER,Of bickering mart and stall.
151,PATH FLOWER,
152,PATH FLOWER,"Without a tuppence for a ride,"
153,PATH FLOWER,Her feet had set her free.
154,PATH FLOWER,"Her rags, that decency defied,"
155,PATH FLOWER,Seemed new with liberty.
156,PATH FLOWER,
157,PATH FLOWER,But she was frail. Who would might note
158,PATH FLOWER,The trail of hungering
159,PATH FLOWER,That for an hour she had forgot
160,PATH FLOWER,In wonder of the Spring.
161,PATH FLOWER,
162,PATH FLOWER,So shriven by her joy she glowed
163,PATH FLOWER,It seemed a sin to chat.
164,PATH FLOWER,(A tea-shop snuggled off the road;
165,PATH FLOWER,Why did I think of that?)
166,PATH FLOWER,
167,PATH FLOWER,"Oh, frail, so frail! I could have wept,--"
168,PATH FLOWER,"But she was passing on,"
169,PATH FLOWER,"And I but muddled ""You'll accept"
170,PATH FLOWER,"A penny for a bun?"""
171,PATH FLOWER,
172,PATH FLOWER,Then up her little throat a spray
173,PATH FLOWER,Of rose climbed for it must;
174,PATH FLOWER,A wilding lost till safe it lay
175,PATH FLOWER,Hid by her curls of rust;
176,PATH FLOWER,
177,PATH FLOWER,And I saw modesties at fence
178,PATH FLOWER,With pride that bore no name;
179,PATH FLOWER,So old it was she knew not whence
180,PATH FLOWER,It sudden woke and came;
181,PATH FLOWER,
182,PATH FLOWER,But that which shone of all most clear
183,PATH FLOWER,"Was startled, sadder thought"
184,PATH FLOWER,That I should give her back the fear
185,PATH FLOWER,Of life she had forgot.
186,PATH FLOWER,
187,PATH FLOWER,"And I blushed for the world we'd made,"
188,PATH FLOWER,"Putting God's hand aside,"
189,PATH FLOWER,Till for the want of sun and shade
190,PATH FLOWER,His little children died;
191,PATH FLOWER,
192,PATH FLOWER,And blushed that I who every year
193,PATH FLOWER,"With Spring went up and down,"
194,PATH FLOWER,Must greet a soul that ached for her
195,PATH FLOWER,"With ""penny for a bun!"""
196,PATH FLOWER,
197,PATH FLOWER,Struck as a thief in holy place
198,PATH FLOWER,"Whose sin upon him cries,"
199,PATH FLOWER,"I watched the flowers leave her face,"
200,PATH FLOWER,The song go from her eyes.
201,PATH FLOWER,
202,PATH FLOWER,"Then she, sweet heart, she saw my rout,"
203,PATH FLOWER,And of her charity
204,PATH FLOWER,A hand of grace put softly out
205,PATH FLOWER,And took the coin from me.
206,PATH FLOWER,
207,PATH FLOWER,"A red-cap sang in Bishop's wood,"
208,PATH FLOWER,A lark o'er Golder's lane;
209,PATH FLOWER,"But I, alone, still glooming stood,"
210,PATH FLOWER,And April plucked in vain;
211,PATH FLOWER,
212,PATH FLOWER,Till living words rang in my ears
213,PATH FLOWER,And sudden music played:
214,PATH FLOWER,_Out of such sacred thirst as hers
215,PATH FLOWER,The world shall be remade._
216,PATH FLOWER,
217,PATH FLOWER,Afar she turned her head and smiled
218,PATH FLOWER,"As might have smiled the Spring,"
219,PATH FLOWER,And humble as a wondering child
220,PATH FLOWER,I watched her vanishing.

264,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Dweller among leaves, and shining twilight boughs"
265,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"That fold cool arms about thine altar place,"
266,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,What joyous race
267,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Of gods dost serve with such unfaltering vows?
268,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,
269,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Weave me a time-fringed tale
270,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Of slumbering, haunted trees,"
271,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And star-sweet fragrances
272,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,No day defiled;
273,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Of bowering nights innumerable,"
274,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And nestling hours breath-nigh a dryad's heart
275,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,That sleeping yet was wild
276,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,With dream-beat that thou mad'st a part
277,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Of thy dawn-fluting; ay, and keep'st it still,"
278,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Striving so late these godless woods to fill
279,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"With undefeated strain,"
280,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And in one hour build the old world again.
281,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Wast thou found singing when Diana drew
282,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Her skirts from the first night?
283,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Didst feel the sun-breath when the valleys grew
284,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Warm with the love of light,"
285,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Till blades of flower-lit green gave to the wind
286,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,The mystery that made sweet
287,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"The earth forever,--strange and undefined"
288,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"As life, as God, as this thy song complete"
289,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,That holds with me twin memories
290,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Of time ere men,"
291,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And ere our ways
292,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Lay sundered with the abyss of air between?
293,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,
294,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"_List, I will lay"
295,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"The world, my song,"
296,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Deep in the heart of day,"
297,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Day that is long
298,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,As the ages dream or the stars delay!
299,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Keep thou from me,"
300,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Sigh-throated man,"
301,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Forever to be
302,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Under the songless wanderer's ban.
303,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,I am of time
304,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,That counteth no dawn;
305,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Thy æons yet climb
306,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"To skies I have won,"
307,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Seeking for aye an unrisen sun!_
308,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,
309,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Soft as a shadow slips
310,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Before the moon, I creep beneath the trees,"
311,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Even to the boughs whose lowest circling tips
312,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Whisper with the anemones
313,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Thick-strewn as though a cloud had made
314,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Its drifting way through spray and leafy braid
315,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And sunk with unremembering ease
316,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,To humbler heaven upon the mossy heaps.
317,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And here a warmer flow
318,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Urges thy melody, yet keeps"
319,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,The cool of bowers; as might a rose blush through
320,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Its unrelinquished dew;
321,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Or bounteous heart that knows not woe,"
322,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Put on the robe of sighs, and fain"
323,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Would hold in love's surmise a neighbour's pain.

328,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,It seems the liquid memory
329,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Of time when thou didst try
330,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Thy gleaning wing through human years,"
331,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"And met, ay, knew the sigh"
332,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Of men who pray, the tears"
333,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"That hide the woman's star,"
334,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,The brave ascending fire

346,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Heart-need is song-need,"
347,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Brother, give me thine!"
348,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Song-meed is heart-meed,"

353,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Into the light.
354,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Dust and the burden
355,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Thou shall outrun;

359,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"O little pagan with the heart of Christ,"
360,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"I go bewildered from thine altar place,"

362,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Nor know if thou deniest
363,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"My destiny and race,"
364,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Man's goalward falterings,"
365,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,To sing the perfect joy that lay
366,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Along the path we missed somewhere,"
367,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"That led thee to thy home in air,"
368,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"While we, soil-creepers, bruise our way"
369,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Toward heights and sunrise bounds
370,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,That wings may know nor feet may win
371,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"For all their scars, for all their wounds;"
372,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Or have I heard within thy strain
373,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"Not sorrow's self, but sorrowing"
374,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"That thou did'st seek the way more free,"
375,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,Nor took with us the trail of pain
376,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,"That endeth not, e'er widening"
377,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,To life that knows what Life may be;
378,TO A HERMIT THRUSH,And ere thou fall'st to silence long

432,THE ROAD,
433,THE ROAD,On Gilead road the shadows creep;
434,THE ROAD,"('Tis noon, and I forget;)"
435,THE ROAD,"By Gilead road the ferns are deep,"
436,THE ROAD,"And waves run emerald, wind-beset,"
437,THE ROAD,To some unsanded shore
438,THE ROAD,Of doe and dove and fay;
439,THE ROAD,"And I for love of that before,"
440,THE ROAD,Forget the hindward way.
441,THE ROAD,
442,THE ROAD,"By Gilead road a river runs,"
443,THE ROAD,(To what unshadowed sea?)
444,THE ROAD,"Bough-hidden here,--there by the sun's"
445,THE ROAD,Gold treachery unbared to me.
446,THE ROAD,"O Beauty in retreat,"
447,THE ROAD,"From beckoned eyes you steal,"
448,THE ROAD,"But the pursuing heart, more fleet,"
449,THE ROAD,Lifts your secretest veil.
450,THE ROAD,
451,THE ROAD,A thrush! What unbuilt temples rear
452,THE ROAD,Their domes where thrushes sing!
453,THE ROAD,"My heart glides in, a worshipper"
454,THE ROAD,"At shrines that ne'er knew offering,"
455,THE ROAD,"Nor eye hath seen, and yet"
456,THE ROAD,"What soul hath not been there,"
457,THE ROAD,Deep in song's fane where we forget
458,THE ROAD,"To pray, for we are prayer."
459,THE ROAD,
460,THE ROAD,And now the shadows start and glide;
461,THE ROAD,"I hear soft, woodland feet;"
462,THE ROAD,And who are they that deeper bide
463,THE ROAD,Where beechen twilights meet?
464,THE ROAD,What trancèd beings smile
465,THE ROAD,On things I may not see?
466,THE ROAD,As with a dream they would beguile
467,THE ROAD,Their own eternity?
468,THE ROAD,
469,THE ROAD,I too shall find my own as they;
470,THE ROAD,"('Tis eve, and I forget;)"
471,THE ROAD,Here in this world where mortals play
472,THE ROAD,As gods with no god's leave or let.
473,THE ROAD,My hope in high purlieus
474,THE ROAD,"Desire erst lockt and kept,"
475,THE ROAD,"On wing unbarred shall seek and choose,--"
476,THE ROAD,"Ay, choose, when I have slept."
477,THE ROAD,
478,THE ROAD,"For happy roads may yet be long,"
479,THE ROAD,And bliss must sometime bed.
480,THE ROAD,"Fern-deep I fall, lose sight and song,"
481,THE ROAD,"The slim palms close above my head,"
482,THE ROAD,"And Life, the Shadow, weaves"
483,THE ROAD,The charm on sleepers laid
484,THE ROAD,Till Time's spent ghost comes not nor grieves
485,THE ROAD,An hourless Gilead.
486,THE ROAD,
487,THE ROAD,"Ay me, I dream my eyes are wet;"
488,THE ROAD,"I sigh, I turn, I weep."
489,THE ROAD,"Alack, that waking we forget"
490,THE ROAD,But to remember when we sleep!
491,THE ROAD,"O vision of closed eyes,"
492,THE ROAD,That burns the heart awake!
493,THE ROAD,O the forgotten truth's reprise
494,THE ROAD,For the forsaken's sake!
495,THE ROAD,
496,THE ROAD,"Far land, blood-red, I feel again"
497,THE ROAD,"Thy hot, unsilenced breath;"
498,THE ROAD,Meet thy unburied eyes of pain
499,THE ROAD,"That, dying ever, find no death;"
500,THE ROAD,See childhood's one gold hour
501,THE ROAD,"Bartered for crust and bed,"
502,THE ROAD,And man's o'erdriven noon devour
503,THE ROAD,His evening peace and bread.
504,THE ROAD,
505,THE ROAD,"I hear men sob,--ay, men,--and shout"
506,THE ROAD,To souls on Gilead road:
507,THE ROAD,"""Tell us the way--we sent ye out--"
508,THE ROAD,"We bought ye free--we paid our blood!"""
509,THE ROAD,Gaunt arms make signal mad;
510,THE ROAD,"O, feel the woe-waves break!"
511,THE ROAD,Does no one hear in Gilead?
512,THE ROAD,"Will one, not one turn back?"
513,THE ROAD,
514,THE ROAD,Rolls higher from the land blood-red
515,THE ROAD,That sea-surge of despair!
516,THE ROAD,"A flame creeps over Gilead,"
517,THE ROAD,"Unseen, unfelt by any there."
518,THE ROAD,"They look not back, the while"
519,THE ROAD,"Doom shadows round them dance,"
520,THE ROAD,"And smile meets slow, unstartled smile"
521,THE ROAD,As in it sleep's mid-chance.
522,THE ROAD,
523,THE ROAD,"""We give our days, we give our blood,"
524,THE ROAD,We send ye far to see!
525,THE ROAD,We break beneath the double load
526,THE ROAD,That ye may walk unbowed and free!
527,THE ROAD,"'Tis ours, the healing shade;"
528,THE ROAD,"'Tis ours, the singing stream;"
529,THE ROAD,"'Tis ours, the charm on sleepers laid;"
530,THE ROAD,"'Tis ours, the toil-won dream!"""
531,THE ROAD,
532,THE ROAD,"Dim grown is Gilead, ashen, lost"
533,THE ROAD,To me who hear that cry.
534,THE ROAD,"""Our every star is hid with dust;"
535,THE ROAD,"The way, the way! Let us not die!"""
536,THE ROAD,"Up from the trampled ferns,"
537,THE ROAD,(O Beauty's praying hands!)
538,THE ROAD,"I stricken start, as one who turns"
539,THE ROAD,From plague's unholy lands.
540,THE ROAD,
541,THE ROAD,"Pale is the dream we dream alone,"
542,THE ROAD,"An unresolving fire,"
543,THE ROAD,Till beacon hearts make it their own
544,THE ROAD,And men are lit with man's desire.
545,THE ROAD,"I mourn no Gilead fair,"
546,THE ROAD,"Back to my own I speed,"
547,THE ROAD,And all my tears are falling where
548,THE ROAD,They sell the sun for bread.
549,THE ROAD,
550,THE ROAD,"Mine too the blow, the unwept scar;"
551,THE ROAD,Mine too the flames that sere;
552,THE ROAD,And on my breast not one proud star
553,THE ROAD,That leaves a brother's heaven bare.
554,THE ROAD,Life is the search of God
555,THE ROAD,For His own unity;
556,THE ROAD,"I walk stone-bare till all are shod,"
557,THE ROAD,No gold may sandal me.
558,THE ROAD,
559,THE ROAD,"I come, O comrades, faster yet!"
560,THE ROAD,For me no bough-hung shade
561,THE ROAD,Till every burning foot be set
562,THE ROAD,In ferns of Gilead.
563,THE ROAD,"The old, old pain of kind,"
564,THE ROAD,"Once mine, is mine once more;"
565,THE ROAD,"And I forget the way behind,"
566,THE ROAD,So dear is that before.

1253,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,Mumbles the tale by her affable gate;
1254,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"How the lad must go, and the girl must stay,"
1255,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,Singing alone to the years and a dream;
1256,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"Then a letter, a rumour, a word"
1257,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,From the land that reaches for lovers
1258,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,And gives them not back;
1259,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,And the maiden looks up with a face that is old;
1260,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"Her smile, as her body, is evermore barren,"
1261,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,Her cheek like the bark of the beech-tree
1262,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,Where climbs the grey winter.
1263,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,
1264,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"Now have I seen her young,"
1265,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"The lone girl singing,"
1266,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"With the full round breast and the berry lip,"
1267,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,And heart that runs to a dawn-rise
1268,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,On new-world mountains.
1269,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,The weeping ash in the dooryard
1270,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"Gathers the song in its boughs,"

1273,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,"I climb the long, dark hillside,"
1274,OLD FAIRINGDOWN,But the ache I have found here I cannot outclimb.

1639,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Take back thy pity. Is it not from man
1640,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Who made that world his own?
1641,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,As barbican
1642,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Sends out its darts, and after flings"

1655,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1656,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Thine ages, are they fair? Shall they yet draw"
1657,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Child-homage from our eyes?

1659,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,As her own babe? Far stretch the avid spans
1660,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of fame-drunk emperies,"
1661,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,And all are man's;
1662,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,But from what tower of praise

1672,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1673,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"The bairning time I knew, the whispering breast,"
1674,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,But in thy world no place
1675,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Was for my nest,"
1676,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Fragrant for perilous brooding pause.
1677,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Thou went'st thy pace;
1678,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,My gathered straws
1679,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,And grasses cast to dust
1680,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,To make thy lust
1681,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"A wayside couch. Deep from the nation's root,"
1682,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"The bower-tree where homes are nesting fruit,"
1683,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Thy blight creeps up unseen
1684,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"On bitten way to the green,"
1685,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Till no hope-banneret
1686,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Makes Spring in windy fret
1687,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of flagellant boughs that whip my fingers bare,"
1688,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Too chill at last to build, to bleed, to care."
1689,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1690,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Must surge so late with Nature's spawning ruse?
1691,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Her stintless passioning
1692,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Lest she should lose
1693,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The younglet of her dearest pang?
1694,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"To thee, her tenderling,"
1695,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,She gave lust-fang
1696,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,To run the jungle's harm;
1697,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Now strives thee to disarm,"
1698,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,And fend Life from that weapon lent thy wear
1699,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Till thou, forsaking dust, mightst capture her."
1700,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,What need now of the blood
1701,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Whose wasteful plenitude
1702,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Swept thee through hostile slime
1703,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"To shores of light and time,"
1704,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Man-minim safe mid frost and poison dews
1705,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Where naught could live that had not life to lose?
1706,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1707,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Yet dost thou foster it as thy veinèd sun;
1708,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Thy Heaven and Holy Rood
1709,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Build toppling on
1710,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Its strifeful hell; root there thy art,"
1711,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Thy dreams of tenderest bud;

1713,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of its fetidity,"
1714,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"This wreck of me,"
1715,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"And sing. O God, what death, in eyes so bound,"
1716,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,They see Life's beauty in her draining wound!
1717,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Lay thou the blind thing down
1718,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"With saurian tusk and bone,"
1719,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,With dust of sworded maw
1720,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"And peril's fossil claw,"
1721,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Lest sexton Earth even Man inter, nor trover"
1722,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Of after-law untomb for Love her Lover!
1723,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1724,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Her lover yet uncarnate; of thy race
1725,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,To be; long-dreamèd mate
1726,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Of her embrace;
1727,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Whose godling fruit, too prized, too dear"
1728,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"For bandit breath, shall wait"
1729,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The Garnerer.
1730,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Not then mute, anguished wives,"
1731,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Dumb in law's gyves,"

1736,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of Toil, the reaver, fall"
1737,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"To dust, their grudgèd pall,"
1738,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Leaving imperial web to those who wear
1739,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,That woof of blood and tears as gossamer.
1740,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1741,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Not then! Where now the wailing way o'erteems,"
1742,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,And baffled starvelings bar
1743,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The way of dreams;
1744,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Pouring to Want, grey-veined Disease,"
1745,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"To Greed, and lurking War,--"

1756,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Till Dream uncorselet clay and put off sleep.
1757,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1758,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,For me one rift! Through this sepultural blight
1759,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"A breath runs living, new;"
1760,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Unburdening light
1761,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,As when the flame-borne prophet on
1762,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The Syrian ploughman threw
1763,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,A people's dawn.
1764,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"The world is Heaven worth,"
1765,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The cradle earth
1766,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Casts orphanhood, a Bethlehem God-swung"
1767,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,From crimson grapple with his lyric young.
1768,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Here triumph I, so low,"
1769,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Knowing that Lust shall go,"

1771,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Shall pass, this curbless, vain"
1772,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Usurping deity that would compel
1773,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The Mary-longing Love to yet mould Jezebel.
1774,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,
1775,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Drag me with life that keeps Death shadow-near
1776,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Till I, unfrighted, wake"
1777,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,His charnel fear
1778,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,In every face that wariful
1779,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Meets mine; this bud-mouth make

1784,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"You think pays all; yet from this reedy mould,"

1786,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Gentility's marsh edge,"

1788,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"My swan-course o'er the brake,"

1796,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,From pain's crushed star-grapes pours
1797,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The climbing light;
1798,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"There thou, beside me then,"
1799,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"With moteless ken,"
1800,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Remembering these, thy pity and thy song,"
1801,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Dropped at the cross where thou didst nail me long,"
1802,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,Shalt sereless 'scape the aim
1803,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of hot, lance-darting shame,"
1804,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,For over thee shall fall
1805,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,The dawn-tressed coronal
1806,MAGDALEN TO HER POET,"Of Love I then shall be, wrapping thee in"

1814,FRIENDS,
1815,FRIENDS,There's one comes often as the sun
1816,FRIENDS,And fills my room with morning; comes with step
1817,FRIENDS,Light as a youth's that joy has hurried home.
1818,FRIENDS,"If he should greet my cheek, so might a wind"
1819,FRIENDS,"Blow roses till they touch, silk leaf to leaf,"
1820,FRIENDS,And on their beauty leave no deeper dye;
1821,FRIENDS,"But with that touch an old world is untombed,"
1822,FRIENDS,"Gay, festal-gowned; and two with nuptial eyes"
1823,FRIENDS,"Walk arm-locked there, flinging the curls of Greece"
1824,FRIENDS,"From proud, smooth brows. As trapped between two throbs,"
1825,FRIENDS,Their laughter dies in silent passion's kiss;
1826,FRIENDS,And I from glow of ancient dust look up
1827,FRIENDS,"To meet the untroubled eyes of my friend's bride,"
1828,FRIENDS,"Her pretty, depthless eyes that smile and smile"
1829,FRIENDS,"Possessingly, not grudging alien me"
1830,FRIENDS,A footstool place about her sceptred love.
1831,FRIENDS,"And I, too, from imperial largess, smile."
1832,FRIENDS,
1833,FRIENDS,"Another comes more rarely than new moon,"
1834,FRIENDS,"And always with a flower,--one; pours tea"
1835,FRIENDS,"Like an old picture softly made alive,"
1836,FRIENDS,Sings me a ballad that once teased the ears
1837,FRIENDS,"Of golden Bess, and reads the book I love."
1838,FRIENDS,"If he must journey, first he comes to lay"
1839,FRIENDS,Knight-service on my hand; no passion then
1840,FRIENDS,More swift than when a last cool petal falls
1841,FRIENDS,To faded summer grass; but as he goes
1842,FRIENDS,"I see a girl deep in a forest lane,"
1843,FRIENDS,A narrow lane dark-roofed with locking firs;
1844,FRIENDS,"And there are purple foxgloves shoulder high,"
1845,FRIENDS,And round the girl's knees Canterbury bells.
1846,FRIENDS,"Upon the air is scent of wounded trees,"
1847,FRIENDS,"As though a storm had passed there, and great owls"
1848,FRIENDS,Ruffle a shade unloved of birds that sing.
1849,FRIENDS,"But at the green lane's end, far down"
1850,FRIENDS,A bit of heart-shaped sun tells where the road
1851,FRIENDS,Lies wide and open; on the sun the still
1852,FRIENDS,Dark shadow of a steed: and by the girl
1853,FRIENDS,"One who shall ride,--unvisored now, and pale."
1854,FRIENDS,"""And when I come,"" he says, to me who know"
1855,FRIENDS,He'll come that way no more; then hear my door
1856,FRIENDS,Closed softly on a sob ten centuries old.
1857,FRIENDS,
1858,FRIENDS,And there is one whom never sun or moon
1859,FRIENDS,Brings to my gate; but when amid a throng
1860,FRIENDS,That fills some worldly room I see him pass.
1861,FRIENDS,The light about me is of regions where
1862,FRIENDS,"Cold peaks are blue against a colder sky,"
1863,FRIENDS,And in the dusk-line where begins the Doubt
1864,FRIENDS,"Men call the Known, we stand in wingless pause,"
1865,FRIENDS,"Unheavened weariness in untaught feet,"
1866,FRIENDS,And in our hearts sad longing for the fire
1867,FRIENDS,"Of stars from whence we came. ""The earth,"" he says,"
1868,FRIENDS,And warms in his my hand amazed to lie
1869,FRIENDS,"In strange, near comfort,--blossom of first pain."
1870,FRIENDS,Then low we dip into the clinging night
1871,FRIENDS,That is the Lethe of God-memories;
1872,FRIENDS,Stumble and sink in chains of time and sense
1873,FRIENDS,"Tangle in treacheries of a weed-hung globe,"
1874,FRIENDS,"And tread the dun, dim verges of defeat"
1875,FRIENDS,"Till spirit chafes to vision, and we learn"
1876,FRIENDS,"What morning is, and where the way of love."
1877,FRIENDS,"In that gold dawn we part, knowing at last"
1878,FRIENDS,That earth can not divide us. With a smile
1879,FRIENDS,"He goes, and Fate leads not but runs before"
1880,FRIENDS,Like an indulgèd child. That smile again
1881,FRIENDS,I sometimes see across the world--a room.

2002,HAVENED,"Whilst thou dost gaze, nor thy poor weaver chide."
2003,HAVENED,
2004,HAVENED,Sweet wonder lay upon my opening eyes
2005,HAVENED,That showed me in a gracious court of trees
2006,HAVENED,"Whose leaves were clouds that caught and lost sunrise,"
2007,HAVENED,And fell in mist upon a twirling breeze
2008,HAVENED,"That traced the ground and to a river grew,"
2009,HAVENED,Casting its tender spray in tinted dew
2010,HAVENED,As curved its silver way with laughing ease.
2011,HAVENED,
2012,HAVENED,"I followed, forest deep, this wooing guide"
2013,HAVENED,"Through fragrant gloom of cliff and bower o'ergrown,"
2014,HAVENED,"Free as a fawn the stream 'twas born beside,"
2015,HAVENED,"Nor held my step with fear at sounds unknown,--"
2016,HAVENED,"High murmurings among the cloudy leaves,"
2017,HAVENED,As when some dull and dreamy throng receives
2018,HAVENED,Strange lyric stir from power not its own.
2019,HAVENED,
2020,HAVENED,"And more and more the murmurs grew like song,"
2021,HAVENED,Save that no song could drop such honey-rain;
2022,HAVENED,"The lyre-god's self would do it unsweet wrong,"
2023,HAVENED,Were he that golden sound to breathe again;
2024,HAVENED,"And as my guide into a cave did pass,"
2025,HAVENED,"That closèd seemed, and yet unclosèd was,"
2026,HAVENED,That airy cadence stooped and bore me in.
2027,HAVENED,
2028,HAVENED,"Then wandered life from out my memory,"
2029,HAVENED,"Gone from desire, as ghost at last must go;"
2030,HAVENED,"Nor shadow fell, where shadow could not be,"
2031,HAVENED,From those dark lures that make our worldly woe.
2032,HAVENED,"O Sweet, forgive that my inconstant tongue"
2033,HAVENED,Should dim the glories that I moved among
2034,HAVENED,With name of gloom that wrongs the world we know.
2035,HAVENED,
2036,HAVENED,"The dome was fair as Heaven, or Heaven, in sooth,"
2037,HAVENED,"It might have been, but that there shone,"
2038,HAVENED,"The centre 'neath, a fountain-featured truth"
2039,HAVENED,That might no rival of its radiance own.
2040,HAVENED,"Ah, this was Heaven's heart, if Heaven be,"
2041,HAVENED,And the bright dome but its gold boundary;
2042,HAVENED,Yet gleamèd here no crown or mounted throne.
2043,HAVENED,
2044,HAVENED,The music budded till it dropped soft showers;
2045,HAVENED,"All things to other changed, though here no mage;"
2046,HAVENED,"Clouds turned to light, and light to sweeter powers,"
2047,HAVENED,And chance and change to all was privilege;
2048,HAVENED,"The air was full of phantom-stirring things,"
2049,HAVENED,"And I not breathed but that I touched new wings,"
2050,HAVENED,And sent some dream on airy pilgrimage.
2051,HAVENED,
2052,HAVENED,Ere my delight had held me pausing long
2053,HAVENED,"Beneath a cloud that rained me lilies cool,"
2054,HAVENED,A stir awoke amid a ferny throng
2055,HAVENED,"That leaned their trembling grace above a pool,"
2056,HAVENED,And following the flutter of a song
2057,HAVENED,To feathery rest where blossoms minute-young
2058,HAVENED,"Oped arms of vermeil soft, and dawning gule,"
2059,HAVENED,
2060,HAVENED,"Mine eye saw Love. White on a verge's mount,"
2061,HAVENED,"That swelled to show its burden dear, she lay;"
2062,HAVENED,"A sighing mist that partly filled the fount,"
2063,HAVENED,"And o'er the brink sought tenderly to stray,"
2064,HAVENED,"For her fair body pillowed soft the ground,"
2065,HAVENED,Growing glad upward arms to clasp her round
2066,HAVENED,And of each grace take new and sweet account.
2067,HAVENED,
2068,HAVENED,"In nymphlike mould her gentle figure ran,"
2069,HAVENED,Though nymph so bright did never sport in dell;
2070,HAVENED,"Her eyes an angel's were, if angels' can"
2071,HAVENED,Be thousand times more fair than dream can tell;
2072,HAVENED,"Unfalling tears they held, yet so could please"
2073,HAVENED,They might have hermits made forget their knees
2074,HAVENED,"And kings find out they had them, such their spell."
2075,HAVENED,
2076,HAVENED,"Above her forehead hovered close a star,"
2077,HAVENED,"Like spirit guard, whose ever-changing ray"
2078,HAVENED,Was fed with fires of sacrifice that are
2079,HAVENED,"Love's life,--the offerings earth lovers lay"
2080,HAVENED,"Upon her shrine, and as they pale or glow"
2081,HAVENED,"She smiles or droops as this true star doth show,--"
2082,HAVENED,Or dim or bright as serve we or betray.
2083,HAVENED,
2084,HAVENED,"Beside her was an instrument of tune,"
2085,HAVENED,"Of changeful beauty as her couch of cloud,"
2086,HAVENED,"And as I looked she woke it to strange rune,"
2087,HAVENED,"As in low murmur moved her thoughts aloud,--"
2088,HAVENED,"For all Love's thoughts are music,--but to make"
2089,HAVENED,"That ditty o'er, what heart would undertake,"
2090,HAVENED,And with a mortal chant her utterance shroud?
2091,HAVENED,
2092,HAVENED,Anear her stood a youth bare of all guise
2093,HAVENED,Save when a light enwrapped him in its flame;
2094,HAVENED,"He bore the ages in his listening eyes,"
2095,HAVENED,And prophecy there waited for a name;
2096,HAVENED,"Joy loved him best, and gave eternity,"
2097,HAVENED,"And his lithe, lustrous being seemed to say"
2098,HAVENED,"""I am the aspiration of all dream."""
2099,HAVENED,
2100,HAVENED,Upward he gazed as though he would read o'er
2101,HAVENED,"The scroll of rising winds, the burst of suns,"
2102,HAVENED,"And lists--ah, might it be earth's shore"
2103,HAVENED,Freed of her epic hates and tunèd groans!
2104,HAVENED,"War's passion beat, and woe's sad chorus past,"
2105,HAVENED,"And all her song pure-winnowed, clear at last,"
2106,HAVENED,Pouring the music of her happy moons!
2107,HAVENED,
2108,HAVENED,"Then moved his lips, but yet unborn is he"
2109,HAVENED,Who may with their resound make sweet his own;
2110,HAVENED,"He who shall come as morning walks the sea,"
2111,HAVENED,Mate of the Wind when all her harps are one;
2112,HAVENED,So much we know by frail yet quenchless light
2113,HAVENED,"That creeps through shadows of our lute-poor night,--"
2114,HAVENED,The brave rose-glimmers of his singing dawn.
2115,HAVENED,
2116,HAVENED,"Lo, every dream new-homing from far ways"
2117,HAVENED,"On silent wing or spirit wave of air,"
2118,HAVENED,"Came circling o'er his head in hovering maze,"
2119,HAVENED,"Seen not, nor heard, albeit I knew them there;"
2120,HAVENED,"But as each passed before his lifted face,"
2121,HAVENED,"They gleamed to sight, and grace so mounted grace"
2122,HAVENED,"My eyes seemed there anointed, though afar."
2123,HAVENED,
2124,HAVENED,Then radiant couriers shook the fountain Heart
2125,HAVENED,And turned me thither. Sweet and bold surprise
2126,HAVENED,Took all my being with such tremorous start
2127,HAVENED,I marvelled how aught else had held my eyes.
2128,HAVENED,I could not tell what the bright wonder was
2129,HAVENED,Whose garner-breast held every beauteous cause
2130,HAVENED,"Makes earth remember, and forget, the skies."
2131,HAVENED,
2132,HAVENED,"There shone the star that lit man's first desire,"
2133,HAVENED,And there his hope that latest fluttered bare;
2134,HAVENED,One look translating made me as a lyre
2135,HAVENED,"Swept with a joy the heart of Truth might share,--"
2136,HAVENED,"Truth that is silent, wanting joy to sing,--"
2137,HAVENED,"But ere I breathèd had for wondering,"
2138,HAVENED,A face out-flashed wreathed with sun-flinging hair.
2139,HAVENED,
2140,HAVENED,"Youth was the angel of that countenance,"
2141,HAVENED,Where graces sprang in ever fairer throng;
2142,HAVENED,"Yet she was old ere any star's birth-dance,"
2143,HAVENED,"If word of earthly time, or old or young,"
2144,HAVENED,Means aught of eyes whose brooding splendour swept
2145,HAVENED,The silences when Uncreation slept
2146,HAVENED,And gave the dream that woke the suns in song.
2147,HAVENED,
2148,HAVENED,Each age that left a glory left it writ
2149,HAVENED,"Upon her brow, as with a pen of light"
2150,HAVENED,"Whose track was pearls, and as each whiter lit"
2151,HAVENED,"The story there, the court grew softlier bright;"
2152,HAVENED,"Each dullsome thing--Oh, no thing there was dull!"
2153,HAVENED,"Flushed o'er itself with glow more beautiful,"
2154,HAVENED,"As might fair, sleeping gods wake to delight."
2155,HAVENED,
2156,HAVENED,"Then all the wonder that made vague her form,"
2157,HAVENED,Oped on a figure splendent so to view;
2158,HAVENED,Mine eyes an instant swooned; and as from storm
2159,HAVENED,Of warring rainbows it endearèd grew
2160,HAVENED,"To shape of her who 'gan descending slow,"
2161,HAVENED,"Fair Love looked up, and Poesy knelt low:"
2162,HAVENED,"'Twas Beauty's self, and mother of the two."
2163,HAVENED,
2164,HAVENED,Whilst yet I gazed all vanished were the three;
2165,HAVENED,And as a sighing shore no more may hold
2166,HAVENED,"The mermaid wave that would go out to sea,"
2167,HAVENED,So slipped the vision from my fancy bold.
2168,HAVENED,"O Flower of Life, no rest for me but this,"
2169,HAVENED,"To dream awhile, and then awake to press"
2170,HAVENED,Upon my heart thy curls' beloved gold!

2447,II,"For root without one bloom,"
2448,II,There strangely blushed
2449,II,"Some little dreams,--not gloriously fine"
2450,II,"As yours and mine,"
2451,II,"But vague, and veiled, and few;"
2452,II,"She hardly knew their names, but felt the stir"
2453,II,"That filled her heart with whispers as they grew,"
2454,II,"And knew that life lay in them, life for her."
2455,II,When Hunger came she turned her breast
2456,II,"And let him feed. Cold followed, gripped"
2457,II,Her veins and sipped
2458,II,The thin blood thinner; both she pressed
2459,II,"As close as lovers, lest"
2460,II,A darker fiend might creep within
2461,II,"Her empty arms; lest she might buy,"
2462,II,"With one swift hour of sin,"
2463,II,"A poisoned ease from tooth of need,--"
2464,II,"A little food, a little fire, and die;"
2465,II,"And she had dreams to shelter, little dreams to feed."
2466,II,"Oh, unresisting dumb!"
2467,II,In wide earth's harvest-gold
2468,II,"She asked no share,"
2469,II,If in the dust a crumb
2470,II,Might be for her;
2471,II,If she might round her aching body fold
2472,II,"One hour's undriven sleep,--"
2473,II,"But one hour more,"
2474,II,Safe from the Want that pried
2475,II,"Her thin and shaken door,--"
2476,II,That hour the shivering dawn denied
2477,II,"With scream that cut life through,"
2478,II,And made her wretched pillow seem a rose
2479,II,Her clinging cheek would keep
2480,II,"In soft, ungoaded death! And ah, suppose"
2481,II,A few more pence the day
2482,II,"Were richly hers, to make youth gay"
2483,II,With ribbon or a flower ere it flew!
2484,II,(So soon toil's wrinkles come!)
2485,II,Then would she make her dreams a fairer home;
2486,II,Then would her heart be stronger where they grew;
2487,II,Then would she walk more bravely knowing them;
2488,II,Then would her eyes be brighter showing them.
2489,II,"Yet did they whisper, yet they stirred"
2490,II,"Uptremblingly, till half their breath"
2491,II,"Was music, half was song;"
2492,II,Told of free hours and a wild heath
2493,II,Where wind and sun ran dappling; of a bird
2494,II,"Bough-throned, whose trill"
2495,II,"Turned all the forest leaves to wings,--"
2496,II,His singing young;
2497,II,Of a moon-goldened hill
2498,II,"Where blossoms danced; of sweeter, holier things;"
2499,II,"A sea-beach grey,"
2500,II,"Where waves were drownèd twilight, and the day"
2501,II,"Hung in a pause that softly, suddenwise,"
2502,II,"Became a soul. She too would have a soul,"
2503,II,"And hours with God and friends; no more give all,"
2504,II,"Now there were dreams, to the machine."
2505,II,"Then rose with young, star-driven eyes"
2506,II,"To face the lords of gain,"
2507,II,And here she lies.
2508,II,
2509,II,"Lift up the cotton, thinned with wear,"
2510,II,"That hides the poor, starved shoulder; bare"
2511,II,"The bruise shows, like a printed paw."
2512,II,"Haste, draw the dumb, frayed sheet again,"
2513,II,And think you cover so the stain
2514,II,Upon our hearts; for--have the truth!--
2515,II,'Twas we who put the club of law
2516,II,Into bought hands to strike her battling youth.
2517,II,"She kept her virtue's gold,"
2518,II,"Fought hunger, fiend, and cold"
2519,II,Unvanquished; when the might of Hell
2520,II,"Rose in law's name and ours, she broken fell."
2521,II,"O friend, when next you smooth the golden head"
2522,II,"Like nestled morning 'gainst your knee,"
2523,II,"Look farther,--see"
2524,II,Fair girlhood dead.
2525,II,"These lips, unvisited by love, were sweet"
2526,II,As are thy fondling's; this want-hollowed cheek
2527,II,A little ease had made
2528,II,"Playground of dimples, joy's rose-seat;"
2529,II,And could these eyes ope they would speak
2530,II,Of one who bought her dreams of Death and paid.
2531,II,If blind thou shrinkest yet
2532,II,"To meet Truth bare,"
2533,II,Then as thou'st dealt with this pale maid
2534,II,Life shall thine own besiege.
2535,II,Injustice holds
2536,II,No sanctuary folds;
2537,II,To fence out care
2538,II,We must the planet hedge;
2539,II,"Justice is God, and waits"
2540,II,Behind our blood-built tower-gates;
2541,II,And as indifference
2542,II,"Was once our soul's pretence,"
2543,II,"Who then shall heed us, who shall understand,"
2544,II,When our crushed hearts lie in the vengeant hand?
2545,II,But is she dead? Faint on my ears
2546,II,"A far-off singing falls,"
2547,II,Sweet from time's sleep
2548,II,Amid the stainless years
2549,II,Yet unawake to men.
2550,II,"Nearer it calls,"
2551,II,"Like music through a rain,"
2552,II,And o'er the distant ridges sweep
2553,II,"Soft garments and young feet. O maidens, ye"
2554,II,"Are like a cloud in beauty,--nay, more swift!"
2555,II,If that the milky stream of stars could lift
2556,II,"Its clustered glory, hasten free,"
2557,II,"And while we marvelled pass from east to west,"
2558,II,Then ye would mirrored be!
2559,II,
2560,II,"The hills seem lit with brides,"
2561,II,And she whose death-cold breast
2562,II,"Was shrouded here, is't she who guides"
2563,II,This fearless company
2564,II,Sure of earth's welcome as a maiden Spring?
2565,II,"And in their eyes the dreams she fought for,"
2566,II,"In their hands the flowers she sought for,"
2567,II,On their lips the songs that here she did not sing!
2568,II,
2569,II,Not dead! While Destiny hath need
2570,II,"Of living dream and deed,"
2571,II,"Ay, she shall deathless be!"
2572,II,"While aught availeth, and God is,"
2573,II,For in her hope lay His!
2574,II,"O, ye who mar Love's face"
2575,II,"Ere Love be born, leave not this place,"
2576,II,"Pass not this white form by,"
2577,II,"Till from assaulted skies ye hear the cry,"
2578,II,"""She is not dead till ye have murdered Me!"""
