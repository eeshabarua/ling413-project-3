104,I.,
105,I.,"Fanny was younger once than she is now,"
106,I.,And prettier of course: I do not mean
107,I.,To say that there are wrinkles on her brow;
108,I.,"Yet, to be candid, she is past eighteen--"
109,I.,Perhaps past twenty--but the girl is shy
110,I.,"About her age, and Heaven forbid that I"
111,I.,
112,I.,
113,II.,II.
114,II.,
115,II.,Should get myself in trouble by revealing
116,II.,A secret of this sort; I have too long
117,II.,"Loved pretty women with a poet's feeling,"
118,II.,"And when a boy, in day dream and in song,"
119,II.,Have knelt me down and worshipp'd them: alas!
120,II.,They never thank'd me for't--but let that pass.
121,II.,
122,II.,
123,III.,III.
124,III.,
125,III.,"I've felt full many a heart-ache in my day,"
126,III.,"At the mere rustling of a muslin gown,"
127,III.,"And caught some dreadful colds, I blush to say,"
128,III.,While shivering in the shade of beauty's frown.
129,III.,They say her smiles are sunbeams--it may be--
130,III.,But never a sunbeam would she throw on me.
131,III.,
132,III.,
133,IV.,IV.
134,IV.,
135,IV.,But Fanny's is an eye that you may gaze on
136,IV.,"For half an hour, without the slightest harm;"
137,IV.,E'en when she wore her smiling summer face on
138,IV.,"There was but little danger, and the charm"
139,IV.,"That youth and wealth once gave, has bade farewell."
140,IV.,"Hers is a sad, sad tale--'tis mine its woes to tell."
141,IV.,
142,IV.,
143,V.,V.
144,V.,
145,V.,"Her father kept, some fifteen years ago,"
146,V.,"A retail dry-good shop in Chatham-street,"
147,V.,"And nursed his little earnings, sure though slow,"
148,V.,"Till, having muster'd wherewithal to meet"
149,V.,"The gaze of the great world, he breathed the air"
150,V.,"Of Pearl-street--and ""set up"" in Hanover-square."
151,V.,
152,V.,
153,VI.,VI.
154,VI.,
155,VI.,"Money is power, 'tis said--I never tried;"
156,VI.,I'm but a poet--and bank-notes to me
157,VI.,"Are curiosities, as closely eyed,"
158,VI.,"Whene'er I get them, as a stone would be,"
159,VI.,"Toss'd from the moon on Doctor Mitchill's table,"
160,VI.,Or classic brickbat from the tower of Babel.
161,VI.,
162,VI.,
163,VII.,VII.
164,VII.,
165,VII.,
166,VII.,But he I sing of well has known and felt
167,VII.,That money hath a power and a dominion;
168,VII.,"For when in Chatham-street the good man dwelt,"
169,VII.,No one would give a sous for his opinion.
170,VII.,"And though his neighbours were extremely civil,"
171,VII.,"Yet, on the whole, they thought him--a poor devil,"
172,VII.,
173,VII.,
174,VIII.,VIII.
175,VIII.,
176,VIII.,A decent kind of person; one whose head
177,VIII.,Was not of brains particularly full;
178,VIII.,It was not known that he had ever said
179,VIII.,"Any thing worth repeating--'twas a dull,"
180,VIII.,"Good, honest man--what Paulding's muse would call"
181,VIII.,"A ""cabbage head""--but he excelled them all"
182,VIII.,
183,VIII.,
184,IX.,IX.
185,IX.,
186,IX.,"In that most noble of the sciences,"
187,IX.,The art of making money; and he found
188,IX.,"The zeal for quizzing him grew less and less,"
189,IX.,As he grew richer; till upon the ground
190,IX.,"Of Pearl-street, treading proudly in the might"
191,IX.,"And majesty of wealth, a sudden light"
192,IX.,
193,IX.,
194,X.,X.
195,X.,
196,X.,Flash'd like the midnight lightning on the eyes
197,X.,"Of all who knew him; brilliant traits of mind,"
198,X.,"And genius, clear and countless as the dies"
199,X.,"Upon the peacock's plumage; taste refined,"
200,X.,"Wisdom and wit, were his--perhaps much more."
201,X.,'Twas strange they had not found it out before.
202,X.,
203,X.,
204,XI.,XI.
205,XI.,
206,XI.,"In this quick transformation, it is true"
207,XI.,That cash had no small share; but there were still
208,XI.,"Some other causes, which then gave a new"
209,XI.,"Impulse to head and heart, and join'd to fill"
210,XI.,His brain with knowledge; for there first he met
211,XI.,"The editor of the New-York Gazette,"
212,XI.,
213,XI.,
214,XII.,XII.
215,XII.,
216,XII.,The sapient Mr. L**G. The world of him
217,XII.,"Knows much, yet not one half so much as he"
218,XII.,Knows of the world. Up to its very brim
219,XII.,The goblet of his mind is sparkling free
220,XII.,"With lore and learning. Had proud Sheba's queen,"
221,XII.,"In all her bloom and beauty, but have seen"
222,XII.,
223,XII.,
224,XIII.,XIII.
225,XIII.,
226,XIII.,"This modern Solomon, the Israelite,"
227,XIII.,"Earth's monarch as he was, had never won her."
228,XIII.,"He would have hang'd himself for very spite,"
229,XIII.,"And she, bless'd woman, might have had the honour"
230,XIII.,"Of some neat ""paragraphs""--worth all the lays"
231,XIII.,That Judah's minstrel warbled in her praise.
232,XIII.,
233,XIII.,
234,XIV.,XIV.
235,XIV.,
236,XIV.,Her star arose too soon; but that which sway'd
237,XIV.,Th' ascendant at our merchant's natal hour
238,XIV.,Was bright with better destiny--its aid
239,XIV.,Led him to pluck within the classic bower
240,XIV.,"Of bulletins, the blossoms of true knowledge;"
241,XIV.,And L**G supplied the loss of school and college.
242,XIV.,
243,XIV.,
244,XV.,XV.
245,XV.,
246,XV.,For there he learn'd the news some minutes sooner
247,XV.,Than others could; and to distinguish well
248,XV.,"The different signals, whether ship or schooner,"
249,XV.,Hoisted at Staten Island; and to tell
250,XV.,"The change of wind, and of his neighbour's fortunes,"
251,XV.,"And, best of all--he there learn'd self-importance."
252,XV.,
253,XV.,
254,XVI.,XVI.
255,XVI.,
256,XVI.,Nor were these all the advantages derived
257,XVI.,"From change of scene; for near his domicil,"
258,XVI.,"He of the pair of polish'd lamps then lived,"
259,XVI.,"And in my hero's promenades, at will,"
260,XVI.,Could he behold them burning--and their flame
261,XVI.,"Kindled within his breast the love of fame,"
262,XVI.,
263,XVI.,
264,XVII.,XVII.
265,XVII.,
266,XVII.,"And politics, and country; the pure glow"
267,XVII.,"Of patriot ardour, and the consciousness"
268,XVII.,That talents such as his might well bestow
269,XVII.,A lustre on the city; she would bless
270,XVII.,"His name; and that some service should be done her,"
271,XVII.,"He pledged ""life, fortune, and his sacred honour."""
272,XVII.,
273,XVII.,
274,XVIII.,XVIII.
275,XVIII.,
276,XVIII.,"And when the sounds of music and of mirth,"
277,XVIII.,"Bursting from Fashion's groups assembled there,"
278,XVIII.,"Were heard, as round their lone plebeian hearth"
279,XVIII.,Fanny and he were seated--he would dare
280,XVIII.,"To whisper fondly, that the time might come"
281,XVIII.,When he and his could give as brilliant routs at home.
282,XVIII.,
283,XVIII.,
284,XIX.,XIX.
285,XIX.,
286,XIX.,"And oft would Fanny near that mansion linger,"
287,XIX.,"When the cold winter moon was high in heaven,"
288,XIX.,"And trace out, by the aid of Fancy's finger,"
289,XIX.,"Cards for some future party, to be given"
290,XIX.,"When she, in turn, should be a _belle_, and they"
291,XIX.,"Had lived their little hour, and pass'd away."
292,XIX.,
293,XIX.,
294,XX.,XX.
295,XX.,
296,XX.,There are some happy moments in this lone
297,XX.,"And desolate world of ours, that well repay"
298,XX.,"The toil of struggling through it, and atone"
299,XX.,"For many a long, sad night and weary day."
300,XX.,They come upon the mind like some wild air
301,XX.,"Of distant music, when we know not where,"
302,XX.,
303,XX.,
304,XXI.,XXI.
305,XXI.,
306,XXI.,"Or whence, the sounds are brought from, and their power,"
307,XXI.,"Though brief, is boundless. That far, future home,"
308,XXI.,"Oft dream'd of, beckons near--it's rose-wreathed bower,"
309,XXI.,And cloudless skies before us: we become
310,XXI.,Changed on the instant--all gold leaf and gilding:
311,XXI.,"This is, in vulgar phrase, call'd ""castle building."""
312,XXI.,
313,XXI.,
314,XXII.,XXII.
315,XXII.,
316,XXII.,"But these, like sunset clouds, fade soon; 'tis vain"
317,XXII.,"To bid them linger longer, or to ask"
318,XXII.,On what day they intend to call again;
319,XXII.,"And, surely, 'twere a philosophic task,"
320,XXII.,"Worthy a Mitchill, in his hours of leisure,"
321,XXII.,To find some means to summon them at pleasure.
322,XXII.,
323,XXII.,
324,XXIII.,XXIII.
325,XXIII.,
326,XXIII.,"There certainly are powers of doing this,"
327,XXIII.,"In some degree at least--for instance, drinking."
328,XXIII.,"Champagne will bathe the heart a while in bliss,"
329,XXIII.,And keep the head a little time from thinking
330,XXIII.,Of cares or creditors--the best wine in town
331,XXIII.,You'll get from Lynch--the cash must be paid down.
332,XXIII.,
333,XXIII.,
334,XXIV.,XXIV.
335,XXIV.,
336,XXIV.,"But if you are a bachelor, like me,"
337,XXIV.,"And spurn all chains, even though made of roses,"
338,XXIV.,I'd recommend segars--there is a free
339,XXIV.,"And happy spirit, that, unseen, reposes"
340,XXIV.,"On the dim shadowy clouds that hover o'er you,"
341,XXIV.,When smoking quietly with a warm fire before you.
342,XXIV.,
343,XXIV.,
344,XXV.,XXV.
345,XXV.,
346,XXV.,"Dear to the exile is his native land,"
347,XXV.,In memory's twilight beauty seen afar:
348,XXV.,"Dear to the broker is a note of hand,"
349,XXV.,Collaterally secured--the polar star
350,XXV.,"Is dear at midnight to the sailor's eyes,"
351,XXV.,"And dear are Bristed's volumes at ""half price;"""
352,XXV.,
353,XXV.,
354,XXVI.,XXVI.
355,XXVI.,
356,XXVI.,But dearer far to me each fairy minute
357,XXVI.,Spent in that fond forgetfulness of grief;
358,XXVI.,"There is an airy web of magic in it,"
359,XXVI.,"As in Othello's pocket-handkerchief,"
360,XXVI.,"Veiling the wrinkles on the brow of sorrow,"
361,XXVI.,"The gathering gloom to-day, the thunder cloud to-morrow"
362,XXVI.,
363,XXVI.,
364,XXVII.,XXVII.
365,XXVII.,
366,XXVII.,And these are innocent thoughts--a man may sit
367,XXVII.,Upon a bright throne of his own creation;
368,XXVII.,Untortured by the ghastly sprites that flit
369,XXVII.,"Around the many, whose exalted station"
370,XXVII.,"Has been attained by means 'twere pain to hint on,"
371,XXVII.,Just for the rhyme's sake--instance Mr. Cl*n*on.
372,XXVII.,
373,XXVII.,
374,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
375,XXVIII.,
376,XXVIII.,"He struggled hard, but not in vain, and breathes"
377,XXVIII.,The mountain air at last; but there are others
378,XXVIII.,"Who strove, like him, to win the glittering wreaths"
379,XXVIII.,"Of power, his early partisans and brothers,"
380,XXVIII.,"That linger yet in dust from whence they sprung,"
381,XXVIII.,"Unhonour'd and unpaid, though, luckily, unhung."
382,XXVIII.,
383,XXVIII.,
384,XXIX.,XXIX.
385,XXIX.,
386,XXIX.,'Twas theirs to fill with gas the huge balloon
387,XXIX.,"Of party; and they hoped, when it arose,"
388,XXIX.,"To soar like eagles in the blaze of noon,"
389,XXIX.,Above the gaping crowd of friends and foes.
390,XXIX.,"Alas! like Guillé's car, it soar'd without them,"
391,XXIX.,And left them with a mob to jeer and flout them.
392,XXIX.,
393,XXIX.,
394,XXX.,XXX.
395,XXX.,
396,XXX.,Though Fanny's moonlight dreams were sweet as those
397,XXX.,I've dwelt so long upon--they were more stable;
398,XXX.,"Hers were not ""castles in the air"" that rose"
399,XXX.,"Based upon nothing; for her sire was able,"
400,XXX.,"As well she knew, to ""buy out"" the one half"
401,XXX.,"Of Fashion's glittering train, that nightly quaff"

405,XXXI.,
406,XXXI.,"Wine, wit, and wisdom, at a midnight rout,"

408,XXXI.,"And ""ruffian"" lounge flash brilliantly without,"
409,XXXI.,"Down to their brother dandies ranged within,"
410,XXXI.,"Gay as the Brussels carpeting they tread on,"
411,XXXI.,And sapient as the oysters they are fed on.
412,XXXI.,
413,XXXI.,
414,XXXII.,XXXII.
415,XXXII.,
416,XXXII.,"And Rumour (she's a famous liar, yet"
417,XXXII.,'Tis wonderful how easy we believe her)
418,XXXII.,"Had whisper'd he was rich, and all he met"
419,XXXII.,"In Wall-street, nodded, smiled, and ""tipp'd the beaver;"""
420,XXXII.,"All, from Mr. Gelston, the collector,"
421,XXXII.,"Down to the broker, and the bank director."
422,XXXII.,
423,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
424,XXXIII.,
425,XXXIII.,"A few brief years pass'd over, and his rank"
426,XXXIII.,Among the worthies of that street was fix'd;
427,XXXIII.,"He had become director of a bank,"
428,XXXIII.,"And six insurance offices, and mix'd"
429,XXXIII.,"Familiarly, as one among his peers,"
430,XXXIII.,"With grocers, dry-good merchants, auctioneers,"
431,XXXIII.,
432,XXXIII.,
433,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
434,XXXIV.,
435,XXXIV.,Brokers of all grades--stock and pawn--and Jews

437,XXXIV.,"On 'Change, that brotherhood the moral muse"
438,XXXIV.,"Delights in, where the heart is pure and warm,"
439,XXXIV.,And each exerts his intellectual force
440,XXXIV.,"To cheat his neighbour--legally, of course."
441,XXXIV.,
442,XXXIV.,
443,XXXV.,XXXV.
444,XXXV.,
445,XXXV.,"And there he shone a planetary star,"
446,XXXV.,"Circled around by lesser orbs, whose beams"
447,XXXV.,From his were borrow'd. The simile is not far
448,XXXV.,"From truth--for many bosom friends, it seems,"
449,XXXV.,"Did borrow of him, and sometimes forget"
450,XXXV.,"To pay--indeed, they have not paid him yet."
451,XXXV.,
452,XXXV.,
453,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
454,XXXVI.,
455,XXXVI.,"But these he deem'd as trifles, when each mouth"
456,XXXVI.,"Was open in his praise, and plaudits rose"
457,XXXVI.,"Upon his willing ear, ""like the sweet south"
458,XXXVI.,"Upon a bank of violets,"" from those"
459,XXXVI.,"Who knew his talents, virtues, and so forth;"
460,XXXVI.,That is--knew how much money he was worth.
461,XXXVI.,
462,XXXVI.,
463,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
464,XXXVII.,
465,XXXVII.,Alas! poor human nature; had he been
466,XXXVII.,"But satisfied with this, his golden days"
467,XXXVII.,"Their setting hour of darkness had not seen,"
468,XXXVII.,And he might still (in the mercantile phrase)
469,XXXVII.,"Be living ""in good order and condition;"""
470,XXXVII.,"But he was ruined by that jade Ambition,"
471,XXXVII.,
472,XXXVII.,
473,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
474,XXXVIII.,
475,XXXVIII.,"""That last infirmity of noble minds,"""

487,XXXIX.,Tompkins' letter was just seen beneath
488,XXXIX.,"Her arm, and in her hand on high she bore"
