30,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Although Bret Harte's name is identified with Californian life, it was"
31,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"not till he was fifteen that the author of ""Plain Language from Truthful"
32,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"James"" saw the country of his adoption.  Francis Bret Harte, to give the"
33,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"full name which he carried till he became famous, was born at Albany,"
34,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"New York, August 25, 1839.  He went with his widowed mother to"
35,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"California in 1854, and was thrown as a young man into the hurly-burly"
36,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,which he more than any other writer has made real to distant and later
37,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"people.  He was by turns a miner, school-teacher, express messenger,"
38,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"printer, and journalist.  The types which live again in his pages are"
39,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"thus not only what he observed, but what he himself impersonated in his"
40,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,own experience.
41,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
42,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He began trying his pen in The Golden Era of San Francisco, where he was"
43,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"working as a compositor; and when The Californian, edited by Charles"
44,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Henry Webb, was started in 1864 as a literary newspaper, he was one of a"
45,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"group of brilliant young fellows--Mark Twain, Charles Warren Stoddard,"
46,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Webb himself, and Prentice Mulford--who gave at once a new interest in"
47,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,California beside what mining and agriculture caused.  Here in an early
48,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"number appeared ""The Ballad of the Emeu,"" and he contributed many poems,"
49,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"grave and gay, as well as prose in a great variety of form.  At the same"
50,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,time he was appointed Secretary of the United States Branch Mint at San
51,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Francisco, holding the office till 1870."
52,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
53,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,But Bret Harte's great opportunity came when The Overland Monthly was
54,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,established in 1868 by Anton Roman.  This magazine was the outgrowth of
55,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the racy, exuberant literary spirit which had already found free"
56,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,expression in the journals named.  An eager ambition to lift all the new
57,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,life of the Pacific into a recognized place in the world of letters made
58,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the young men we have named put their wits together in a monthly
59,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,magazine which should rival the Atlantic in Boston and Blackwood in
60,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Edinburgh.  The name was easily had, and for a sign manual on the cover"
61,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"some one drew a grizzly bear, that formidable exemplar of Californian"
62,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"wildness.  But the design did not quite satisfy, until Bret Harte, with"
63,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"a felicitous stroke, drew two parallel lines just before the feet of the"
64,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,halting brute.  Now it was the grizzly of the wilderness drawing back
65,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"before the railway of civilization, and the picture was complete as an"
66,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,emblem.
67,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
68,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Bret Harte became, by the common urgency of his companions, the first"
69,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"editor of the Overland, and at once his own tales and poems began, and"
70,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in the second number appeared ""The Luck of Roaring Camp,"" which"
71,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,instantly brought him wide fame.  In a few months he found himself
72,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"besought for poems and articles, sketches and stories, in influential"
73,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"magazines, and in 1871 he turned away from the Pacific coast, and took"
74,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"up his residence, first in New York, afterward in Boston."
75,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
76,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""No one,"" says his old friend, Mr. Stoddard, ""who knows Mr. Harte, and"
77,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"knew the California of his day, wonders that he left it as he did."
78,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Eastern editors were crying for his work.  Cities vied with one another
79,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,in the offer of tempting bait.  When he turned his back on San
80,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Francisco, and started for Boston, he began a tour that the greatest"
81,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,author of any age might have been proud of.  It was a veritable ovation
82,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,that swelled from sea to sea: the classic sheep was sacrificed all along
83,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the route.  I have often thought that if Bret Harte had met with a fatal
84,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"accident during that transcontinental journey, the world would have"
85,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,declared with one voice that the greatest genius of his time was lost to
86,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"it."""
87,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
88,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,In Boston he entered into an arrangement with the predecessors of the
89,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"publishers of this volume, and his contributions appeared in their"
90,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,periodicals and were gathered into volumes.  The arrangement in one form
91,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"or another continued to the time of his death, and has for witness a"
92,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,stately array of comely volumes; but the prose has far outstripped the
93,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,poetry.  There are few writers of Mr. Harte's prodigality of nature who
94,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"have used with so much fine reserve their faculty for melodious verse,"
95,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and the present volume contains the entire body of his poetical work,"
96,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,growing by minute accretions during thirty odd years.
97,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
98,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1878 he was appointed United States Consul at Crefeld, Germany, and"
99,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"after that date he resided, with little interruption, on the Continent"
100,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"or in England.  He was transferred to Glasgow in March, 1880, and"
101,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"remained there until July, 1885.  During the rest of his life he made"
102,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his home in London.  His foreign residence is disclosed in a number of
103,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,prose sketches and tales and in one or two poems; but life abroad never
104,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,dimmed the vividness of the impressions made on him by the experience of
105,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"his early manhood when he partook of the elixir vitae of California, and"
106,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the stories which from year to year flowed from an apparently
107,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,inexhaustible fountain glittered with the gold washed down from the
108,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,mountain slopes of that country which through his imagination he had
109,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,made so peculiarly his own.
110,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
111,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Mr. Harte died suddenly at Camberley, England, May 6, 1902."

398,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Brief is the glory that hero earns,"
399,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Briefer the story of poor John Burns.
400,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"He was the fellow who won renown,--"
401,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,The only man who didn't back down
402,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,When the rebels rode through his native town;
403,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"But held his own in the fight next day,"

411,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,I might tell how but the day before

413,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Looking down the village street,"
414,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Where, in the shade of his peaceful vine,"
415,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"He heard the low of his gathered kine,"
416,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And felt their breath with incense sweet;
417,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Or I might say, when the sunset burned"
418,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"The old farm gable, he thought it turned"
419,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,The milk that fell like a babbling flood

421,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Or how he fancied the hum of bees
422,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Were bullets buzzing among the trees.
423,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,But all such fanciful thoughts as these
424,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Were strange to a practical man like Burns,"
425,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Who minded only his own concerns,"
426,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Troubled no more by fancies fine
427,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Than one of his calm-eyed, long-tailed kine,--"
428,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact,"
429,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Slow to argue, but quick to act."
430,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"That was the reason, as some folk say,"
431,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,He fought so well on that terrible day.
432,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,
433,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And it was terrible.  On the right

436,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Difficult music for men to face
437,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,While on the left--where now the graves
438,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Undulate like the living waves
439,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,That all that day unceasing swept
440,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Up to the pits the rebels kept--
441,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Round shot ploughed the upland glades,"
442,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Sown with bullets, reaped with blades;"
443,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Shattered fences here and there
444,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Tossed their splinters in the air;
445,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,The very trees were stripped and bare;
446,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,The barns that once held yellow grain
447,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Were heaped with harvests of the slain;

451,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,With strange shells bursting in each nest.

453,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Just where the tide of battle turns,"
454,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Erect and lonely stood old John Burns.
455,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,How do you think the man was dressed?
456,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"He wore an ancient long buff vest,"
457,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Yellow as saffron,--but his best;"
458,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And buttoned over his manly breast
459,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Was a bright blue coat, with a rolling collar,"
460,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"And large gilt buttons,--size of a dollar,--"
461,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"With tails that the country-folk called ""swaller."""
462,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"He wore a broad-brimmed, bell-crowned hat,"
463,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,White as the locks on which it sat.
464,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Never had such a sight been seen
465,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"For forty years on the village green,"
466,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Since old John Burns was a country beau,"
467,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"And went to the ""quiltings"" long ago."
468,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,
469,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Close at his elbows all that day,"
470,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Veterans of the Peninsula,"
471,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Sunburnt and bearded, charged away;"

477,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,With scraps of a slangy repertoire:
478,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"""How are you, White Hat?""  ""Put her through!"""
479,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"""Your head's level!"" and ""Bully for you!"""
480,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Called him ""Daddy,""--begged he'd disclose"
481,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"The name of the tailor who made his clothes,"
482,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And what was the value he set on those;
483,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"While Burns, unmindful of jeer and scoff,"
484,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Stood there picking the rebels off,--"
485,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"With his long brown rifle and bell-crown hat,"
486,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And the swallow-tails they were laughing at.
487,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,
488,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"'Twas but a moment, for that respect"
489,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Which clothes all courage their voices checked;
490,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And something the wildest could understand
491,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Spake in the old man's strong right hand,"
492,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"And his corded throat, and the lurking frown"
493,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown;
494,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Until, as they gazed, there crept an awe"
495,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Through the ranks in whispers, and some men saw,"
496,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"In the antique vestments and long white hair,"
497,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,The Past of the Nation in battle there;
498,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And some of the soldiers since declare
499,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"That the gleam of his old white hat afar,"
500,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre,"
501,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,That day was their oriflamme of war.
502,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,
503,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,So raged the battle.  You know the rest:
504,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"How the rebels, beaten and backward pressed,"
505,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,Broke at the final charge and ran.
506,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,At which John Burns--a practical man--
507,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"Shouldered his rifle, unbent his brows,"
508,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,And then went back to his bees and cows.
509,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,
510,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,That is the story of old John Burns;
511,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,This is the moral the reader learns:
512,JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG,"In fighting the battle, the question's whether"

836,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
837,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,I read last night of the grand review
838,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"In Washington's chiefest avenue,--"
839,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Two hundred thousand men in blue,"
840,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"I think they said was the number,--"
841,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet,"
842,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"The bugle blast and the drum's quick beat,"
843,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"The clatter of hoofs in the stony street,"
844,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"The cheers of people who came to greet,"
845,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,And the thousand details that to repeat
846,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Would only my verse encumber,--"
847,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Till I fell in a reverie, sad and sweet,"
848,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,And then to a fitful slumber.
849,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
850,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"When, lo! in a vision I seemed to stand"
851,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,In the lonely Capitol.  On each hand
852,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Far stretched the portico, dim and grand"
853,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Its columns ranged like a martial band
854,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Of sheeted spectres, whom some command"
855,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Had called to a last reviewing.
856,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"And the streets of the city were white and bare,"
857,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,No footfall echoed across the square;
858,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,But out of the misty midnight air
859,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"I heard in the distance a trumpet blare,"
860,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,And the wandering night-winds seemed to bear
861,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,The sound of a far tattooing.
862,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
863,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Then I held my breath with fear and dread
864,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"For into the square, with a brazen tread,"
865,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,There rode a figure whose stately head
866,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"O'erlooked the review that morning,"
867,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,That never bowed from its firm-set seat
868,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"When the living column passed its feet,"
869,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Yet now rode steadily up the street
870,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,To the phantom bugle's warning:
871,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
872,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Till it reached the Capitol square, and wheeled,"
873,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,And there in the moonlight stood revealed
874,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,A well-known form that in State and field
875,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Had led our patriot sires:
876,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp,"
877,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Afar through the river's fog and damp,"
878,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"That showed no flicker, nor waning lamp,"
879,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Nor wasted bivouac fires.
880,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
881,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"And I saw a phantom army come,"
882,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"With never a sound of fife or drum,"
883,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,But keeping time to a throbbing hum
884,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Of wailing and lamentation:
885,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill,"
886,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville,"
887,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,The men whose wasted figures fill
888,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,The patriot graves of the nation.
889,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
890,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"And there came the nameless dead,--the men"
891,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Who perished in fever swamp and fen,"
892,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,The slowly-starved of the prison pen;
893,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"And, marching beside the others,"
894,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Came the dusky martyrs of Pillow's fight,"
895,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,With limbs enfranchised and bearing bright;
896,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,I thought--perhaps 'twas the pale moonlight--
897,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,They looked as white as their brothers!
898,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
899,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"And so all night marched the nation's dead,"
900,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"With never a banner above them spread,"
901,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Nor a badge, nor a motto brandished;"
902,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,No mark--save the bare uncovered head
903,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Of the silent bronze Reviewer;
904,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,With never an arch save the vaulted sky;
905,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,With never a flower save those that lie
906,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,On the distant graves--for love could buy
907,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,No gift that was purer or truer.
908,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,
909,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"So all night long swept the strange array,"
910,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,So all night long till the morning gray
911,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,I watched for one who had passed away;
912,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"With a reverent awe and wonder,--"
913,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,"Till a blue cap waved in the length'ning line,"
914,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,And I knew that one who was kin of mine
915,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Had come; and I spake--and lo! that sign
916,A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY,Awakened me from my slumber.

1397,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Men from the West, but where I know not;"
1398,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Haggard and travel-stained, worn and gray,"
1399,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,With never a ribbon or lace or bow-knot:
1400,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And I opened the window, and, leaning there,"
1401,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,I felt in their presence the free winds blowing.
1402,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"My neck and shoulders and arms were bare,--"
1403,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"I did not dream they might think me fair,"
1404,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"But I had some flowers that night in my hair,"
1405,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And here, on my bosom, a red rose glowing."
1406,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,
1407,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And I looked from the window along the line,"
1408,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Dusty and dirty and grim and solemn,"
1409,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Till an eye like a bayonet flash met mine,"
1410,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And a dark face shone from the darkening column,"
1411,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And a quick flame leaped to my eyes and hair,"
1412,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Till cheeks and shoulders burned all together,"
1413,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,And the next I found myself standing there
1414,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"With my eyelids wet and my cheeks less fair,"
1415,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And the rose from my bosom tossed high in air,"
1416,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,Like a blood-drop falling on plume and feather.
1417,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,
1418,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Then I drew back quickly: there came a cheer,"
1419,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"A rush of figures, a noise and tussle,"
1420,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And then it was over, and high and clear"
1421,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,My red rose bloomed on his gun's black muzzle.
1422,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Then far in the darkness a sharp voice cried,"
1423,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And slowly and steadily, all together,"
1424,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Shoulder to shoulder and side to side,"
1425,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Rising and falling and swaying wide,"
1426,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"But bearing above them the rose, my pride,"
1427,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,They marched away in the twilight weather.
1428,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,
1429,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,And I leaned from my window and watched my rose
1430,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Tossed on the waves of the surging column,"
1431,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Warmed from above in the sunset glows,"
1432,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,Borne from below by an impulse solemn.
1433,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,Then I shut the window.  I heard no more
1434,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Of my soldier friend, nor my flower neither,"
1435,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,But lived my life as I did before.
1436,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"I did not go as a nurse to the war,--"
1437,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Sick folks to me are a dreadful bore,--"
1438,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,So I didn't go to the hospital either.
1439,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,
1440,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"You smile, O poet, and what do you?"
1441,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"You lean from your window, and watch life's column"
1442,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Trampling and struggling through dust and dew,"
1443,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,Filled with its purposes grave and solemn;
1444,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And an act, a gesture, a face--who knows?--"
1445,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Touches your fancy to thrill and haunt you,"
1446,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,And you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows
1447,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And down it flies like my red, red rose,"
1448,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And you sit and dream as away it goes,"
1449,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And think that your duty is done,--now don't you?"
1450,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,
1451,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,I know your answer.  I'm not yet through.
1452,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Look at this photograph,--""In the Trenches""!"
1453,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,That dead man in the coat of blue
1454,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,Holds a withered rose in his hand.  That clenches
1455,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"Nothing!--except that the sun paints true,"
1456,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,And a woman is sometimes prophetic-minded.
1457,MISS BLANCHE SAYS,"And that's my romance.  And, poet, you"

2257,I,I
2258,I,
2259,I,"Where the sun sinks through leagues of arid sky,"
2260,I,"Where the sun dies o'er leagues of arid plain,"
2261,I,"Where the dead bones of wasted rivers lie,"
2262,I,Trailed from their channels in yon mountain chain;
2263,I,Where day by day naught takes the wearied eye
2264,I,"But the low-rimming mountains, sharply based"
2265,I,"On the dead levels, moving far or nigh,"
2266,I,"As the sick vision wanders o'er the waste,"
2267,I,But ever day by day against the sunset traced:
2268,I,
2269,II,II
2270,II,
2271,II,There moving through a poisonous cloud that stings
2272,II,With dust of alkali the trampling band
2273,II,"Of Indian ponies, ride on dusky wings"
2274,II,The red marauders of the Western land;
2275,II,"Heavy with spoil, they seek the trail that brings"
2276,II,Their flaunting lances to that sheltered bank
2277,II,Where lie their lodges; and the river sings
2278,II,"Forgetful of the plain beyond, that drank"
2279,II,"Its life blood, where the wasted caravan sank."
2280,II,
2281,III,III
2282,III,
2283,III,"They brought with them the thief's ignoble spoil,"
2284,III,"The beggar's dole, the greed of chiffonnier,"
2285,III,"The scum of camps, the implements of toil"
2286,III,"Snatched from dead hands, to rust as useless here;"
2287,III,All they could rake or glean from hut or soil
2288,III,"Piled their lean ponies, with the jackdaw's greed"
2289,III,For vacant glitter.  It were scarce a foil
2290,III,To all this tinsel that one feathered reed
2291,III,Bore on its barb two scalps that freshly bleed!
2292,III,
2293,IV,IV
2294,IV,
2295,IV,"They brought with them, alas! a wounded foe,"
2296,IV,"Bound hand and foot, yet nursed with cruel care,"
2297,IV,Lest that in death he might escape one throe
2298,IV,They had decreed his living flesh should bear:
2299,IV,"A youthful officer, by one foul blow"
2300,IV,"Of treachery surprised, yet fighting still"
2301,IV,"Amid his ambushed train, calm as the snow"
2302,IV,"Above him; hopeless, yet content to spill"
2303,IV,"His blood with theirs, and fighting but to kill."
2304,IV,
2305,V,V
2306,V,
2307,V,"He had fought nobly, and in that brief spell"
2308,V,Had won the awe of those rude border men
2309,V,"Who gathered round him, and beside him fell"
2310,V,"In loyal faith and silence, save that when"
2311,V,"By smoke embarrassed, and near sight as well,"
2312,V,"He paused to wipe his eyeglass, and decide"
2313,V,"Its nearer focus, there arose a yell"
2314,V,"Of approbation, and Bob Barker cried,"
2315,V,"""Wade in, Dundreary!"" tossed his cap and--died."
2316,V,
2317,VI,VI
2318,VI,
2319,VI,Their sole survivor now! his captors bear
2320,VI,"Him all unconscious, and beside the stream"
2321,VI,Leave him to rest; meantime the squaws prepare
2322,VI,The stake for sacrifice: nor wakes a gleam
2323,VI,Of pity in those Furies' eyes that glare
2324,VI,Expectant of the torture; yet alway
2325,VI,His steadfast spirit shines and mocks them there
2326,VI,"With peace they know not, till at close of day"
2327,VI,"On his dull ear there thrills a whispered ""Grey!"""
2328,VI,
2329,VII,VII
2330,VII,
2331,VII,He starts!  Was it a trick?  Had angels kind
2332,VII,Touched with compassion some weak woman's breast?
2333,VII,Such things he'd read of!  Faintly to his mind
2334,VII,Came Pocahontas pleading for her guest.
2335,VII,"But then, this voice, though soft, was still inclined"
2336,VII,To baritone!  A squaw in ragged gown
2337,VII,"Stood near him, frowning hatred.  Was he blind?"
2338,VII,Whose eye was this beneath that beetling frown?
2339,VII,"The frown was painted, but that wink meant--Brown!"
2340,VII,
2341,VIII,VIII
2342,VIII,
2343,VIII,"""Hush! for your life and mine! the thongs are cut,"""
2344,VIII,"He whispers; ""in yon thicket stands my horse."
2345,VIII,"One dash!--I follow close, as if to glut"
2346,VIII,"My own revenge, yet bar the others' course."
2347,VIII,"Now!""  And 'tis done.  Grey speeds, Brown follows; but"
2348,VIII,"Ere yet they reach the shade, Grey, fainting, reels,"
2349,VIII,Yet not before Brown's circling arms close shut
2350,VIII,"His in, uplifting him!  Anon he feels"
2351,VIII,"A horse beneath him bound, and hears the rattling heels."
2352,VIII,
2353,IX,IX
2354,IX,
2355,IX,"Then rose a yell of baffled hate, and sprang"
2356,IX,Headlong the savages in swift pursuit;
2357,IX,"Though speed the fugitives, they hope to hang"
2358,IX,"Hot on their heels, like wolves, with tireless foot."
2359,IX,Long is the chase; Brown hears with inward pang
2360,IX,"The short, hard panting of his gallant steed"
2361,IX,Beneath its double burden; vainly rang
2362,IX,"Both voice and spur.  The heaving flanks may bleed,"
2363,IX,Yet comes the sequel that they still must heed!
2364,IX,
2365,X,X
2366,X,
2367,X,"Brown saw it--reined his steed; dismounting, stood"
2368,X,"Calm and inflexible.  ""Old chap! you see"
2369,X,There is but ONE escape.  You know it?  Good!
2370,X,There is ONE man to take it.  You are he.
2371,X,"The horse won't carry double.  If he could,"
2372,X,'Twould but protract this bother.  I shall stay:
2373,X,"I've business with these devils, they with me;"
2374,X,I will occupy them till you get away.
2375,X,"Hush! quick time, forward.  There! God bless you, Grey!"""
2376,X,
2377,XI,XI
2378,XI,
2379,XI,"But as he finished, Grey slipped to his feet,"
2380,XI,Calm as his ancestors in voice and eye:
2381,XI,"""You do forget yourself when you compete"
2382,XI,With him whose RIGHT it is to stay and die:
2383,XI,That's not YOUR duty.  Please regain your seat;
2384,XI,And take my ORDERS--since I rank you here!--
2385,XI,"Mount and rejoin your men, and my defeat"
2386,XI,Report at quarters.  Take this letter; ne'er
2387,XI,"Give it to aught but HER, nor let aught interfere."""
2388,XI,
2389,XII,XII
2390,XII,
2391,XII,"And, shamed and blushing, Brown the letter took"
2392,XII,Obediently and placed it in his pocket;
2393,XII,"Then, drawing forth another, said, ""I look"
2394,XII,"For death as you do, wherefore take this locket"
2395,XII,"And letter.""  Here his comrade's hand he shook"
2396,XII,"In silence.  ""Should we both together fall,"
2397,XII,"Some other man""--but here all speech forsook"
2398,XII,"His lips, as ringing cheerily o'er all"
2399,XII,He heard afar his own dear bugle-call!
2400,XII,
2401,XIII,XIII
2402,XIII,
2403,XIII,"'Twas his command and succor, but e'en then"
2404,XIII,"Grey fainted, with poor Brown, who had forgot"
2405,XIII,"He likewise had been wounded, and both men"
2406,XIII,Were picked up quite unconscious of their lot.
2407,XIII,"Long lay they in extremity, and when"
2408,XIII,"They both grew stronger, and once more exchanged"
2409,XIII,"Old vows and memories, one common ""den"""
2410,XIII,"In hospital was theirs, and free they ranged,"
2411,XIII,"Awaiting orders, but no more estranged."
2412,XIII,
2413,XIV,XIV
2414,XIV,
2415,XIV,And yet 'twas strange--nor can I end my tale
2416,XIV,"Without this moral, to be fair and just:"
2417,XIV,They never sought to know why each did fail
2418,XIV,The prompt fulfillment of the other's trust.
2419,XIV,It was suggested they could not avail
2420,XIV,"Themselves of either letter, since they were"
2421,XIV,Duly dispatched to their address by mail
2422,XIV,"By Captain X., who knew Miss Rover fair"
2423,XIV,Now meant stout Mistress Bloggs of Blank Blank Square.

2435,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2436,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,This is the tale that the Chronicle
2437,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Tells of the wonderful miracle
2438,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Wrought by the pious Padre Serro,"
2439,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The very reverend Junipero.
2440,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2441,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"The heathen stood on his ancient mound,"
2442,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Looking over the desert bound
2443,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Into the distant, hazy South,"
2444,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Over the dusty and broad champaign,"
2445,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Where, with many a gaping mouth"
2446,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"And fissure, cracked by the fervid drouth,"
2447,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,For seven months had the wasted plain
2448,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Known no moisture of dew or rain.
2449,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The wells were empty and choked with sand;
2450,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The rivers had perished from the land;
2451,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Only the sea-fogs to and fro
2452,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Slipped like ghosts of the streams below.
2453,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Deep in its bed lay the river's bones,"
2454,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Bleaching in pebbles and milk-white stones,"
2455,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"And tracked o'er the desert faint and far,"
2456,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Its ribs shone bright on each sandy bar.
2457,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2458,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Thus they stood as the sun went down
2459,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Over the foot-hills bare and brown;
2460,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Thus they looked to the South, wherefrom"
2461,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"The pale-face medicine-man should come,"
2462,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Not in anger or in strife,"
2463,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,But to bring--so ran the tale--
2464,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"The welcome springs of eternal life,"
2465,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The living waters that should not fail.
2466,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2467,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Said one, ""He will come like Manitou,"
2468,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Unseen, unheard, in the falling dew."""
2469,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Said another, ""He will come full soon"
2470,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Out of the round-faced watery moon."""
2471,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"And another said, ""He is here!"" and lo,"
2472,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Faltering, staggering, feeble and slow,"
2473,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Out from the desert's blinding heat
2474,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The Padre dropped at the heathen's feet.
2475,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2476,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,They stood and gazed for a little space
2477,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Down on his pallid and careworn face,"
2478,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,And a smile of scorn went round the band
2479,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,As they touched alternate with foot and hand
2480,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"This mortal waif, that the outer space"
2481,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Of dim mysterious sky and sand
2482,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Flung with so little of Christian grace
2483,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Down on their barren, sterile strand."
2484,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2485,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Said one to him: ""It seems thy God"
2486,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Is a very pitiful kind of God:
2487,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,He could not shield thine aching eyes
2488,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"From the blowing desert sands that rise,"
2489,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Nor turn aside from thy old gray head
2490,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The glittering blade that is brandished
2491,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,By the sun He set in the heavens high;
2492,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,He could not moisten thy lips when dry;
2493,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The desert fire is in thy brain;
2494,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Thy limbs are racked with the fever-pain.
2495,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,If this be the grace He showeth thee
2496,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Who art His servant, what may we,"
2497,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Strange to His ways and His commands,"
2498,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Seek at His unforgiving hands?"""
2499,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2500,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"""Drink but this cup,"" said the Padre, straight,"
2501,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"""And thou shalt know whose mercy bore"
2502,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"These aching limbs to your heathen door,"
2503,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,And purged my soul of its gross estate.
2504,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Drink in His name, and thou shalt see"
2505,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The hidden depths of this mystery.
2506,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Drink!"" and he held the cup.  One blow"
2507,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,From the heathen dashed to the ground below
2508,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"The sacred cup that the Padre bore,"
2509,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,And the thirsty soil drank the precious store
2510,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Of sacramental and holy wine,"
2511,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,That emblem and consecrated sign
2512,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,And blessed symbol of blood divine.
2513,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2514,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Then, says the legend (and they who doubt"
2515,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"The same as heretics be accurst),"
2516,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,From the dry and feverish soil leaped out
2517,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,A living fountain; a well-spring burst
2518,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Over the dusty and broad champaign,"
2519,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"Over the sandy and sterile plain,"
2520,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Till the granite ribs and the milk-white stones
2521,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,That lay in the valley--the scattered bones--
2522,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Moved in the river and lived again!
2523,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,
2524,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Such was the wonderful miracle
2525,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,Wrought by the cup of wine that fell
2526,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,"From the hands of the pious Padre Serro,"
2527,THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO,The very reverend Junipero.

2532,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN
2533,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2534,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Of all the fountains that poets sing,--"
2535,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Crystal, thermal, or mineral spring,"
2536,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Ponce de Leon's Fount of Youth,"
2537,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Wells with bottoms of doubtful truth,--"
2538,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"In short, of all the springs of Time"
2539,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"That ever were flowing in fact or rhyme,"
2540,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"That ever were tasted, felt, or seen,"
2541,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,There were none like the Spring of San Joaquin.
2542,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2543,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Anno Domini eighteen-seven,"
2544,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Father Dominguez (now in heaven,--"
2545,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Obiit eighteen twenty-seven)
2546,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Found the spring, and found it, too,"
2547,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,By his mule's miraculous cast of a shoe;
2548,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,For his beast--a descendant of Balaam's ass--
2549,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Stopped on the instant, and would not pass."
2550,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2551,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"The Padre thought the omen good,"
2552,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And bent his lips to the trickling flood;
2553,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Then--as the Chronicles declare,"
2554,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,On the honest faith of a true believer--
2555,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"His cheeks, though wasted, lank, and bare,"
2556,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Filled like a withered russet pear
2557,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"In the vacuum of a glass receiver,"
2558,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And the snows that seventy winters bring
2559,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Melted away in that magic spring.
2560,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2561,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Such, at least, was the wondrous news"
2562,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The Padre brought into Santa Cruz.
2563,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"The Church, of course, had its own views"
2564,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Of who were worthiest to use
2565,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The magic spring; but the prior claim
2566,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Fell to the aged, sick, and lame."
2567,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Far and wide the people came:
2568,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Some from the healthful Aptos Creek
2569,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Hastened to bring their helpless sick;
2570,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Even the fishers of rude Soquel
2571,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Suddenly found they were far from well;
2572,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The brawny dwellers of San Lorenzo
2573,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Said, in fact, they had never been so;"
2574,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"And all were ailing,--strange to say,--"
2575,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,From Pescadero to Monterey.
2576,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2577,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Over the mountain they poured in,"
2578,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,With leathern bottles and bags of skin;
2579,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Through the canyons a motley throng
2580,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Trotted, hobbled, and limped along."
2581,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The Fathers gazed at the moving scene
2582,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,With pious joy and with souls serene;
2583,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And then--a result perhaps foreseen--
2584,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,They laid out the Mission of San Joaquin.
2585,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2586,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Not in the eyes of faith alone
2587,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The good effects of the water shone;
2588,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"But skins grew rosy, eyes waxed clear,"
2589,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Of rough vaquero and muleteer;
2590,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Angular forms were rounded out,"
2591,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Limbs grew supple and waists grew stout;
2592,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"And as for the girls,--for miles about"
2593,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"They had no equal!  To this day,"
2594,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"From Pescadero to Monterey,"
2595,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,You'll still find eyes in which are seen
2596,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The liquid graces of San Joaquin.
2597,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2598,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"There is a limit to human bliss,"
2599,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And the Mission of San Joaquin had this;
2600,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,None went abroad to roam or stay
2601,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"But they fell sick in the queerest way,--"
2602,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"A singular maladie du pays,"
2603,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,With gastric symptoms: so they spent
2604,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Their days in a sensuous content,"
2605,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Caring little for things unseen
2606,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Beyond their bowers of living green,"
2607,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Beyond the mountains that lay between
2608,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The world and the Mission of San Joaquin.
2609,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,
2610,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Winter passed, and the summer came"
2611,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"The trunks of madrono, all aflame,"
2612,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Here and there through the underwood
2613,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Like pillars of fire starkly stood.
2614,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,All of the breezy solitude
2615,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Was filled with the spicing of pine and bay
2616,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And resinous odors mixed and blended;
2617,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"And dim and ghostlike, far away,"
2618,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The smoke of the burning woods ascended.
2619,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"Then of a sudden the mountains swam,"
2620,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"The rivers piled their floods in a dam,"
2621,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,The ridge above Los Gatos Creek
2622,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,Arched its spine in a feline fashion;
2623,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,"The forests waltzed till they grew sick,"
2624,THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN,And Nature shook in a speechless passion;

2998,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","""Last night, to her father's dying bed"
2999,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",By a priest was the lady summoned;

3001,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3002,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","""But hope for the best.""  The grave Viceroy"

3012,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Myself shall ride as your escort east."""
3013,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3014,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",The Viceroy bowed.  Then turned aside

3049,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3050,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","I know not.  Yet did the seneschal,"
3051,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",Chancing in after-years to fall
3052,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Pierced by a Flemish musket-ball,"
3053,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3054,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Call to his side a trusty friar,"
3055,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","And bid him swear, as his last desire,"
3056,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",To bear his corse to San Pedro's choir

3058,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","At Leon, where 'neath a shield azure"

3061,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3062,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",Be sure that the friar loyally
3063,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Fulfilled his trust by land and sea,"

3065,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3066,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Rose through the green of the Almandral,"
3067,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",As if to beckon the seneschal
3068,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",To his kindred dust 'neath the choir wall.
3069,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3070,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",I wot that the saints on either side
3071,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",Leaned from their niches open-eyed

3073,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3074,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",That the wounds of the Saviour on either flank
3075,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Bled fresh, as the mourners, rank by rank,"

3077,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3078,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",For why?  When they raised the marble door
3079,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)","Of the tomb, untouched for years before,"
3080,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",The friar swooned on the choir floor;
3081,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",

3085,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",
3086,"(NORTHERN MEXICO, 1640)",As on the night she had passed away;

3243,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)",And the way was this.  Did I say before

3269,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)",They came; each knelt in her turn and place
3270,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)",To the pious Fray with his hidden face
3271,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)","And voiceless lips, and each again"

3277,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)",From fear or from shame--the monks said so--
3278,"(REFECTORY, MISSION SAN GABRIEL, 1869)","But the Fray leaned forward, when, presto! all"

3327,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3328,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,It was the morning season of the year;
3329,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,It was the morning era of the land;
3330,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The watercourses rang full loud and clear;
3331,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Portala's cross stood where Portala's hand
3332,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Had planted it when Faith was taught by Fear,"
3333,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,When monks and missions held the sole command
3334,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Of all that shore beside the peaceful sea,"
3335,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Where spring-tides beat their long-drawn reveille.
3336,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3337,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Out of the mission of San Luis Rey,"
3338,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"All in that brisk, tumultuous spring weather,"
3339,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Rode Friar Pedro, in a pious way,"
3340,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"With six dragoons in cuirasses of leather,"
3341,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Each armed alike for either prayer or fray;
3342,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Handcuffs and missals they had slung together,"
3343,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And as an aid the gospel truth to scatter
3344,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Each swung a lasso--alias a ""riata."""
3345,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3346,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"In sooth, that year the harvest had been slack,"
3347,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The crop of converts scarce worth computation;
3348,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Some souls were lost, whose owners had turned back"
3349,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,To save their bodies frequent flagellation;
3350,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And some preferred the songs of birds, alack!"
3351,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"To Latin matins and their souls' salvation,"
3352,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And thought their own wild whoopings were less dreary
3353,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Than Father Pedro's droning miserere.
3354,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3355,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"To bring them back to matins and to prime,"
3356,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"To pious works and secular submission,"
3357,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"To prove to them that liberty was crime,--"
3358,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"This was, in fact, the Padre's present mission;"
3359,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"To get new souls perchance at the same time,"
3360,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And bring them to a ""sense of their condition,""--"
3361,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"That easy phrase, which, in the past and present,"
3362,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Means making that condition most unpleasant.
3363,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3364,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow;
3365,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill;
3366,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the gopher working in his burrow;
3367,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the squirrel scampering at his will:--
3368,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He saw all this, and felt no doubt a thorough"
3369,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And deep conviction of God's goodness; still
3370,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He failed to see that in His glory He
3371,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Yet left the humblest of His creatures free.
3372,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3373,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He saw the flapping crow, whose frequent note"
3374,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Voiced the monotony of land and sky,"
3375,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Mocking with graceless wing and rusty coat
3376,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,His priestly presence as he trotted by.
3377,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He would have cursed the bird by bell and rote,"
3378,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"But other game just then was in his eye,--"
3379,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A savage camp, whose occupants preferred"
3380,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Their heathen darkness to the living Word.
3381,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3382,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He rang his bell, and at the martial sound"
3383,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed;
3384,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Six horses sprang across the level ground
3385,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,As six dragoons in open order dashed;
3386,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Above their heads the lassos circled round,"
3387,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,In every eye a pious fervor flashed;
3388,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"They charged the camp, and in one moment more"
3389,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,They lassoed six and reconverted four.
3390,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3391,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The Friar saw the conflict from a knoll,"
3392,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And sang Laus Deo and cheered on his men:
3393,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"""Well thrown, Bautista,--that's another soul;"
3394,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"After him, Gomez,--try it once again;"
3395,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"This way, Felipe,--there the heathen stole;"
3396,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Bones of St. Francis!--surely that makes TEN;
3397,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Te Deum laudamus--but they're very wild;
3398,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Non nobis Domine--all right, my child!"""
3399,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3400,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,When at that moment--as the story goes--
3401,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A certain squaw, who had her foes eluded,"
3402,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Ran past the Friar, just before his nose."
3403,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He stared a moment, and in silence brooded;"
3404,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Then in his breast a pious frenzy rose
3405,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And every other prudent thought excluded;
3406,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He caught a lasso, and dashed in a canter"
3407,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,After that Occidental Atalanta.
3408,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3409,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,High o'er his head he swirled the dreadful noose;
3410,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"But, as the practice was quite unfamiliar,"
3411,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"His first cast tore Felipe's captive loose,"
3412,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And almost choked Tiburcio Camilla,"
3413,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And might have interfered with that brave youth's
3414,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Ability to gorge the tough tortilla;
3415,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"But all things come by practice, and at last"
3416,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,His flying slip-knot caught the maiden fast.
3417,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3418,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Then rose above the plain a mingled yell
3419,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Of rage and triumph,--a demoniac whoop:"
3420,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The Padre heard it like a passing knell,"
3421,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And would have loosened his unchristian loop;
3422,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"But the tough raw-hide held the captive well,"
3423,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And held, alas! too well the captor-dupe;"
3424,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"For with one bound the savage fled amain,"
3425,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Dragging horse, Friar, down the lonely plain."
3426,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3427,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Down the arroyo, out across the mead,"
3428,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"By heath and hollow, sped the flying maid,"
3429,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Dragging behind her still the panting steed
3430,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And helpless Friar, who in vain essayed"
3431,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,To cut the lasso or to check his speed.
3432,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He felt himself beyond all human aid,"
3433,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And trusted to the saints,--and, for that matter,"
3434,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,To some weak spot in Felipe's riata.
3435,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3436,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Alas! the lasso had been duly blessed,"
3437,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And, like baptism, held the flying wretch,--"
3438,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed,"
3439,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Which, like the lasso, might be made to stretch,"
3440,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,But would not break; so neither could divest
3441,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Themselves of it, but, like some awful fetch,"
3442,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The holy Friar had to recognize
3443,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The image of his fate in heathen guise.
3444,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3445,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow;
3446,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill;
3447,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the gopher standing in his burrow;
3448,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,He saw the squirrel scampering at his will:--
3449,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"He saw all this, and felt no doubt how thorough"
3450,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The contrast was to his condition; still
3451,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The squaw kept onward to the sea, till night"
3452,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And the cold sea-fog hid them both from sight.
3453,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3454,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The morning came above the serried coast,"
3455,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Lighting the snow-peaks with its beacon-fires,"
3456,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Driving before it all the fleet-winged host
3457,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Of chattering birds above the Mission spires,"
3458,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Filling the land with light and joy, but most"
3459,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The savage woods with all their leafy lyres;
3460,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,In pearly tints and opal flame and fire
3461,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The morning came, but not the holy Friar."
3462,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3463,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Weeks passed away.  In vain the Fathers sought
3464,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Some trace or token that might tell his story;
3465,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Some thought him dead, or, like Elijah, caught"
3466,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Up to the heavens in a blaze of glory.
3467,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,In this surmise some miracles were wrought
3468,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"On his account, and souls in purgatory"
3469,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Were thought to profit from his intercession;
3470,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"In brief, his absence made a ""deep impression."""
3471,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3472,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,A twelvemonth passed; the welcome Spring once more
3473,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Made green the hills beside the white-faced Mission,"
3474,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Spread her bright dais by the western shore,"
3475,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And sat enthroned, a most resplendent vision."
3476,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The heathen converts thronged the chapel door
3477,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"At morning mass, when, says the old tradition,"
3478,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A frightful whoop throughout the church resounded,"
3479,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And to their feet the congregation bounded.
3480,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3481,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A tramp of hoofs upon the beaten course,"
3482,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Then came a sight that made the bravest quail:
3483,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"A phantom Friar on a spectre horse,"
3484,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Dragged by a creature decked with horns and tail.
3485,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"By the lone Mission, with the whirlwind's force,"
3486,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"They madly swept, and left a sulphurous trail:"
3487,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And that was all,--enough to tell the story,"
3488,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And leave unblessed those souls in purgatory.
3489,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3490,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"And ever after, on that fatal day"
3491,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"That Friar Pedro rode abroad lassoing,"
3492,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,A ghostly couple came and went away
3493,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"With savage whoop and heathenish hallooing,"
3494,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"Which brought discredit on San Luis Rey,"
3495,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And proved the Mission's ruin and undoing;
3496,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"For ere ten years had passed, the squaw and Friar"
3497,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Performed to empty walls and fallen spire.
3498,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,
3499,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,The Mission is no more; upon its wall.
3500,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"The golden lizards slip, or breathless pause,"
3501,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Still as the sunshine brokenly that falls
3502,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Through crannied roof and spider-webs of gauze;
3503,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,"No more the bell its solemn warning calls,--"
3504,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,A holier silence thrills and overawes;
3505,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,And the sharp lights and shadows of to-day
3506,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE,Outline the Mission of San Luis Rey.

3630,THE LOST GALLEON*,White as the teeth of the Indian girls;
3631,THE LOST GALLEON*,The traders sat by their full bazaars;
3632,THE LOST GALLEON*,"The mules with many a weary load,"
3633,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And oxen dragging their creaking cars,"
3634,THE LOST GALLEON*,Came and went on the mountain road.
3635,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3636,THE LOST GALLEON*,Where was the galleon all this while?
3637,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Wrecked on some lonely coral isle,"
3638,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Burnt by the roving sea-marauders,"
3639,THE LOST GALLEON*,Or sailing north under secret orders?
3640,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Had she found the Anian passage famed,"
3641,THE LOST GALLEON*,"By lying Maldonado claimed,"
3642,THE LOST GALLEON*,And sailed through the sixty-fifth degree
3643,THE LOST GALLEON*,Direct to the North Atlantic Sea?
3644,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Or had she found the ""River of Kings,"""
3645,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Of which De Fonte told such strange things,"
3646,THE LOST GALLEON*,"In sixteen forty?  Never a sign,"
3647,THE LOST GALLEON*,"East or west or under the line,"
3648,THE LOST GALLEON*,They saw of the missing galleon;
3649,THE LOST GALLEON*,Never a sail or plank or chip
3650,THE LOST GALLEON*,"They found of the long-lost treasure-ship,"
3651,THE LOST GALLEON*,Or enough to build a tale upon.
3652,THE LOST GALLEON*,"But when she was lost, and where and how,"
3653,THE LOST GALLEON*,Are the facts we're coming to just now.
3654,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3655,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Take, if you please, the chart of that day,"
3656,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Published at Madrid,--por el Rey;"
3657,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Look for a spot in the old South Sea,"
3658,THE LOST GALLEON*,The hundred and eightieth degree
3659,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Longitude west of Madrid: there,"
3660,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Under the equatorial glare,"
3661,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Just where the east and west are one,"
3662,THE LOST GALLEON*,"You'll find the missing galleon,--"
3663,THE LOST GALLEON*,"You'll find the San Gregorio, yet"
3664,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Riding the seas, with sails all set,"
3665,THE LOST GALLEON*,Fresh as upon the very day
3666,THE LOST GALLEON*,She sailed from Acapulco Bay.
3667,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3668,THE LOST GALLEON*,How did she get there?  What strange spell
3669,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Kept her two hundred years so well,"
3670,THE LOST GALLEON*,Free from decay and mortal taint?
3671,THE LOST GALLEON*,What but the prayers of a patron saint!
3672,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3673,THE LOST GALLEON*,"A hundred leagues from Manilla town,"
3674,THE LOST GALLEON*,The San Gregorio's helm came down;
3675,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Round she went on her heel, and not"
3676,THE LOST GALLEON*,A cable's length from a galliot
3677,THE LOST GALLEON*,That rocked on the waters just abreast
3678,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Of the galleon's course, which was west-sou'-west."
3679,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3680,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Then said the galleon's commandante,"
3681,THE LOST GALLEON*,General Pedro Sobriente
3682,THE LOST GALLEON*,"(That was his rank on land and main,"
3683,THE LOST GALLEON*,"A regular custom of Old Spain),"
3684,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""My pilot is dead of scurvy: may"
3685,THE LOST GALLEON*,"I ask the longitude, time, and day?"""
3686,THE LOST GALLEON*,The first two given and compared;
3687,THE LOST GALLEON*,The third--the commandante stared!
3688,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""The FIRST of June?  I make it second."""
3689,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Said the stranger, ""Then you've wrongly reckoned;"
3690,THE LOST GALLEON*,"I make it FIRST: as you came this way,"
3691,THE LOST GALLEON*,"You should have lost, d'ye see, a day;"
3692,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Lost a day, as plainly see,"
3693,THE LOST GALLEON*,"On the hundred and eightieth degree."""
3694,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""Lost a day?""  ""Yes; if not rude,"
3695,THE LOST GALLEON*,"When did you make east longitude?"""
3696,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""On the ninth of May,--our patron's day."""
3697,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""On the ninth?--YOU HAD NO NINTH OF MAY!"
3698,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Eighth and tenth was there; but stay""--"
3699,THE LOST GALLEON*,Too late; for the galleon bore away.
3700,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3701,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Lost was the day they should have kept,"
3702,THE LOST GALLEON*,Lost unheeded and lost unwept;
3703,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Lost in a way that made search vain,"
3704,THE LOST GALLEON*,Lost in a trackless and boundless main;
3705,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Lost like the day of Job's awful curse,"
3706,THE LOST GALLEON*,"In his third chapter, third and fourth verse;"
3707,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Wrecked was their patron's only day,--"
3708,THE LOST GALLEON*,What would the holy Fathers say?
3709,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3710,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Said the Fray Antonio Estavan,"
3711,THE LOST GALLEON*,"The galleon's chaplain,--a learned man,--"
3712,THE LOST GALLEON*,"""Nothing is lost that you can regain;"
3713,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And the way to look for a thing is plain,"
3714,THE LOST GALLEON*,"To go where you lost it, back again."
3715,THE LOST GALLEON*,Back with your galleon till you see
3716,THE LOST GALLEON*,The hundred and eightieth degree.
3717,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Wait till the rolling year goes round,"
3718,THE LOST GALLEON*,And there will the missing day be found;
3719,THE LOST GALLEON*,"For you'll find, if computation's true,"
3720,THE LOST GALLEON*,That sailing EAST will give to you
3721,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Not only one ninth of May, but two,--"
3722,THE LOST GALLEON*,"One for the good saint's present cheer,"
3723,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And one for the day we lost last year."""
3724,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3725,THE LOST GALLEON*,Back to the spot sailed the galleon;
3726,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Where, for a twelvemonth, off and on"
3727,THE LOST GALLEON*,The hundred and eightieth degree
3728,THE LOST GALLEON*,She rose and fell on a tropic sea.
3729,THE LOST GALLEON*,"But lo! when it came to the ninth of May,"
3730,THE LOST GALLEON*,All of a sudden becalmed she lay
3731,THE LOST GALLEON*,"One degree from that fatal spot,"
3732,THE LOST GALLEON*,Without the power to move a knot;
3733,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And of course the moment she lost her way,"
3734,THE LOST GALLEON*,Gone was her chance to save that day.
3735,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3736,THE LOST GALLEON*,"To cut a lengthening story short,"
3737,THE LOST GALLEON*,She never saved it.  Made the sport
3738,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Of evil spirits and baffling wind,"
3739,THE LOST GALLEON*,"She was always before or just behind,"
3740,THE LOST GALLEON*,"One day too soon or one day too late,"
3741,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And the sun, meanwhile, would never wait."
3742,THE LOST GALLEON*,"She had two Eighths, as she idly lay,"
3743,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Two Tenths, but never a NINTH of May;"
3744,THE LOST GALLEON*,And there she rides through two hundred years
3745,THE LOST GALLEON*,Of dreary penance and anxious fears;
3746,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Yet, through the grace of the saint she served,"
3747,THE LOST GALLEON*,Captain and crew are still preserved.
3748,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3749,THE LOST GALLEON*,"By a computation that still holds good,"
3750,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Made by the Holy Brotherhood,"
3751,THE LOST GALLEON*,The San Gregorio will cross that line
3752,THE LOST GALLEON*,In nineteen hundred and thirty-nine:
3753,THE LOST GALLEON*,Just three hundred years to a day
3754,THE LOST GALLEON*,From the time she lost the ninth of May.
3755,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And the folk in Acapulco town,"
3756,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Over the waters looking down,"
3757,THE LOST GALLEON*,Will see in the glow of the setting sun
3758,THE LOST GALLEON*,"The sails of the missing galleon,"
3759,THE LOST GALLEON*,"And the royal standard of Philip Rey,"
3760,THE LOST GALLEON*,"The gleaming mast and glistening spar,"
3761,THE LOST GALLEON*,As she nears the surf of the outer bar.
3762,THE LOST GALLEON*,"A Te Deum sung on her crowded deck,"
3763,THE LOST GALLEON*,"An odor of spice along the shore,"
3764,THE LOST GALLEON*,"A crash, a cry from a shattered wreck,--"
3765,THE LOST GALLEON*,And the yearly galleon sails no more
3766,THE LOST GALLEON*,In or out of the olden bay;
3767,THE LOST GALLEON*,For the blessed patron has found his day.
3768,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3769,THE LOST GALLEON*,-------
3770,THE LOST GALLEON*,
3771,THE LOST GALLEON*,Such is the legend.  Hear this truth:
3772,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Over the trackless past, somewhere,"
3773,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Lie the lost days of our tropic youth,"
3774,THE LOST GALLEON*,"Only regained by faith and prayer,"
3775,THE LOST GALLEON*,Only recalled by prayer and plaint:
3776,THE LOST GALLEON*,Each lost day has its patron saint!

3919,DOW'S FLAT,And I reckon that you
3920,DOW'S FLAT,Are a stranger?  The same?
3921,DOW'S FLAT,"Well, I thought it was true,--"
3922,DOW'S FLAT,For thar isn't a man on the river as can't spot the place at first
3923,DOW'S FLAT,view.
3924,DOW'S FLAT,
3925,DOW'S FLAT,"It was called after Dow,--"
3926,DOW'S FLAT,"Which the same was an ass,--"
3927,DOW'S FLAT,And as to the how
3928,DOW'S FLAT,"Thet the thing kem to pass,--"
3929,DOW'S FLAT,"Jest tie up your hoss to that buckeye, and sit ye down here in the"
3930,DOW'S FLAT,grass.
3931,DOW'S FLAT,
3932,DOW'S FLAT,You see this 'yer Dow
3933,DOW'S FLAT,Hed the worst kind of luck;
3934,DOW'S FLAT,He slipped up somehow
3935,DOW'S FLAT,On each thing thet he struck.
3936,DOW'S FLAT,"Why, ef he'd a straddled thet fence-rail, the derned thing'd get up"
3937,DOW'S FLAT,and buck.
3938,DOW'S FLAT,
3939,DOW'S FLAT,He mined on the bar
3940,DOW'S FLAT,Till he couldn't pay rates;
3941,DOW'S FLAT,He was smashed by a car
3942,DOW'S FLAT,When he tunneled with Bates;
3943,DOW'S FLAT,And right on the top of his trouble kem his wife and five kids from
3944,DOW'S FLAT,the States.
3945,DOW'S FLAT,
3946,DOW'S FLAT,"It was rough,--mighty rough;"
3947,DOW'S FLAT,"But the boys they stood by,"
3948,DOW'S FLAT,And they brought him the stuff
3949,DOW'S FLAT,"For a house, on the sly;"
3950,DOW'S FLAT,"And the old woman,--well, she did washing, and took on when no one"
3951,DOW'S FLAT,was nigh.
3952,DOW'S FLAT,
3953,DOW'S FLAT,But this 'yer luck of Dow's
3954,DOW'S FLAT,Was so powerful mean
3955,DOW'S FLAT,That the spring near his house
3956,DOW'S FLAT,Dried right up on the green;
3957,DOW'S FLAT,"And he sunk forty feet down for water, but nary a drop to be seen."
3958,DOW'S FLAT,
3959,DOW'S FLAT,"Then the bar petered out,"
3960,DOW'S FLAT,And the boys wouldn't stay;
3961,DOW'S FLAT,"And the chills got about,"
3962,DOW'S FLAT,And his wife fell away;
3963,DOW'S FLAT,But Dow in his well kept a peggin' in his usual ridikilous way.
3964,DOW'S FLAT,
3965,DOW'S FLAT,"One day,--it was June,"
3966,DOW'S FLAT,"And a year ago, jest--"
3967,DOW'S FLAT,This Dow kem at noon
3968,DOW'S FLAT,"To his work like the rest,"
3969,DOW'S FLAT,"With a shovel and pick on his shoulder, and derringer hid in his"
3970,DOW'S FLAT,breast.
3971,DOW'S FLAT,
3972,DOW'S FLAT,"He goes to the well,"
3973,DOW'S FLAT,"And he stands on the brink,"
3974,DOW'S FLAT,And stops for a spell
3975,DOW'S FLAT,Jest to listen and think:
3976,DOW'S FLAT,"For the sun in his eyes (jest like this, sir!), you see, kinder made"
3977,DOW'S FLAT,the cuss blink.
3978,DOW'S FLAT,
3979,DOW'S FLAT,His two ragged gals
3980,DOW'S FLAT,"In the gulch were at play,"
3981,DOW'S FLAT,And a gownd that was Sal's
3982,DOW'S FLAT,Kinder flapped on a bay:
3983,DOW'S FLAT,"Not much for a man to be leavin', but his all,--as I've heer'd the"
3984,DOW'S FLAT,folks say.
3985,DOW'S FLAT,

3988,DOW'S FLAT,What might be her cost?
3989,DOW'S FLAT,"Eh?  Oh!--Well, then, Dow--"
3990,DOW'S FLAT,"Let's see,--well, that forty-foot grave wasn't his, sir, that day,"
3991,DOW'S FLAT,anyhow.
3992,DOW'S FLAT,
3993,DOW'S FLAT,For a blow of his pick
3994,DOW'S FLAT,"Sorter caved in the side,"
3995,DOW'S FLAT,"And he looked and turned sick,"
3996,DOW'S FLAT,Then he trembled and cried.
3997,DOW'S FLAT,"For you see the dern cuss had struck--""Water?""--Beg your parding,"
3998,DOW'S FLAT,"young man,--there you lied!"
3999,DOW'S FLAT,
4000,DOW'S FLAT,"It was GOLD,--in the quartz,"

4002,DOW'S FLAT,And I reckon five oughts
4003,DOW'S FLAT,Was the worth of that strike;
4004,DOW'S FLAT,"And that house with the coopilow's his'n,--which the same isn't bad"
4005,DOW'S FLAT,for a Pike.
4006,DOW'S FLAT,
4007,DOW'S FLAT,Thet's why it's Dow's Flat;
4008,DOW'S FLAT,And the thing of it is
4009,DOW'S FLAT,That he kinder got that
4010,DOW'S FLAT,Through sheer contrairiness:
4011,DOW'S FLAT,"For 'twas WATER the derned cuss was seekin', and his luck made him"

4898,THOMPSON OF ANGELS,Then rose a pallid man--a man sick with fever and ague;
4899,THOMPSON OF ANGELS,"Small was he, and his step was tremulous, weak, and uncertain;"

4910,THOMPSON OF ANGELS,"Never again returned the Crested Jay Hawk of the mountains,"
4911,THOMPSON OF ANGELS,Never again was seen the Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley.
4912,THOMPSON OF ANGELS,

5379,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Just by the moonlit bank, and thence"
5380,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Came a drunken man with no more sense
5381,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Than to drop on the rail
5382,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Flat as a flail,"

5388,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Kinder stared in the face of Jim,"
5389,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"And says, ""What now?"""

5392,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,

5396,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Jim turned pale, but he tried to smile,"
5397,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Then on he tore
5398,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Ten mile or more,"
5399,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,In quicker time than he'd made afore.
5400,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,
5401,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Would you believe it! the very next night
5402,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Up rose that house in the moonlight white,"
5403,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Out comes the chap and drops as before,"
5404,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Down goes the brake and the rest encore;
5405,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"And so, in fact,"
5406,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,Each night that act

5408,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,
5409,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"Humph! let me see; it's a year now, 'most,"
5410,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"That I met Jim, East, and says, ""How's your ghost?"""
5411,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"""Gone,"" says Jim; ""and more, it's plain"
5412,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,That ghost don't trouble me again.
5413,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,I thought I shook
5414,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,That ghost when I took
5415,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"A place on an Eastern line,--but look!"
5416,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,
5417,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"""What should I meet, the first trip out,"
5418,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"But the very house we talked about,"

5420,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,It's time to stop this 'yer foolishness.'
5421,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,"So I crammed on steam,"
5422,THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW,When there came a scream

5784,(REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES),"And then the Chair grew very white, and the Chair said he'd adjourn,"

6096,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"They ran through the streets of the seaport town,"
6097,A GREYPORT LEGEND,They peered from the decks of the ships that lay;
6098,A GREYPORT LEGEND,The cold sea-fog that came whitening down
6099,A GREYPORT LEGEND,Was never as cold or white as they.

6102,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Scatter your boats on the lower bay."""
6103,A GREYPORT LEGEND,
6104,A GREYPORT LEGEND,Good cause for fear!  In the thick mid-day
6105,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"The hulk that lay by the rotting pier,"
6106,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Filled with the children in happy play,"
6107,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Parted its moorings and drifted clear,"
6108,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Drifted clear beyond reach or call,--"
6109,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Thirteen children they were in all,--"
6110,A GREYPORT LEGEND,All adrift in the lower bay!
6111,A GREYPORT LEGEND,
6112,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Said a hard-faced skipper, ""God help us all!"

6114,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Said his wife, ""My darling will hear MY call,"
6115,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Whether in sea or heaven she bide;"""
6116,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"And she lifted a quavering voice and high,"
6117,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"Wild and strange as a sea-bird's cry,"
6118,A GREYPORT LEGEND,Till they shuddered and wondered at her side.
6119,A GREYPORT LEGEND,
6120,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"The fog drove down on each laboring crew,"
6121,A GREYPORT LEGEND,Veiled each from each and the sky and shore:
6122,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"There was not a sound but the breath they drew,"
6123,A GREYPORT LEGEND,And the lap of water and creak of oar;
6124,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"And they felt the breath of the downs, fresh blown"
6125,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"O'er leagues of clover and cold gray stone,"
6126,A GREYPORT LEGEND,But not from the lips that had gone before.
6127,A GREYPORT LEGEND,
6128,A GREYPORT LEGEND,They came no more.  But they tell the tale
6129,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"That, when fogs are thick on the harbor reef,"
6130,A GREYPORT LEGEND,The mackerel fishers shorten sail--
6131,A GREYPORT LEGEND,For the signal they know will bring relief;
6132,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"For the voices of children, still at play"
6133,A GREYPORT LEGEND,In a phantom hulk that drifts alway

6135,A GREYPORT LEGEND,
6136,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"It is but a foolish shipman's tale,"
6137,A GREYPORT LEGEND,A theme for a poet's idle page;
6138,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"But still, when the mists of Doubt prevail,"
6139,A GREYPORT LEGEND,"And we lie becalmed by the shores of Age,"

6148,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6149,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,They say that she died of a broken heart
6150,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,(I tell the tale as 'twas told to me);
6151,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"But her spirit lives, and her soul is part"
6152,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Of this sad old house by the sea.
6153,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6154,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Her lover was fickle and fine and French:
6155,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,It was nearly a hundred years ago
6156,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,When he sailed away from her arms--poor wench!--
6157,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,With the Admiral Rochambeau.
6158,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6159,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,I marvel much what periwigged phrase
6160,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker,"
6161,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,At what gold-laced speech of those modish days
6162,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,She listened--the mischief take her!
6163,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6164,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,But she kept the posies of mignonette
6165,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,That he gave; and ever as their bloom failed
6166,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And faded (though with her tears still wet)
6167,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Her youth with their own exhaled.
6168,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6169,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Till one night, when the sea-fog wrapped a shroud"
6170,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Round spar and spire and tarn and tree,"
6171,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Her soul went up on that lifted cloud
6172,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,From this sad old house by the sea.
6173,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6174,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And ever since then, when the clock strikes two,"
6175,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"She walks unbidden from room to room,"
6176,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And the air is filled that she passes through
6177,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"With a subtle, sad perfume."
6178,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6179,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"The delicate odor of mignonette,"
6180,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"The ghost of a dead-and-gone bouquet,"
6181,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Is all that tells of her story; yet
6182,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Could she think of a sweeter way?
6183,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6184,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6185,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"I sit in the sad old house to-night,--"
6186,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Myself a ghost from a farther sea;
6187,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And I trust that this Quaker woman might,"
6188,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"In courtesy, visit me."
6189,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6190,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"For the laugh is fled from porch and lawn,"
6191,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And the bugle died from the fort on the hill,"
6192,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone,"
6193,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And the grand piano is still.
6194,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6195,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two:
6196,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And there is no sound in the sad old house,"
6197,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"But the long veranda dripping with dew,"
6198,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And in the wainscot a mouse.
6199,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6200,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,The light of my study-lamp streams out
6201,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"From the library door, but has gone astray"
6202,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,In the depths of the darkened hall. Small doubt
6203,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,But the Quakeress knows the way.
6204,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6205,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Was it the trick of a sense o'erwrought
6206,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,With outward watching and inward fret?
6207,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,But I swear that the air just now was fraught
6208,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,With the odor of mignonette!
6209,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6210,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"I open the window, and seem almost--"
6211,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,So still lies the ocean--to hear the beat
6212,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Of its Great Gulf artery off the coast,"
6213,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And to bask in its tropic heat.
6214,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6215,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"In my neighbor's windows the gas-lights flare,"
6216,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss;
6217,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And I wonder now could I fit that air
6218,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,To the song of this sad old house.
6219,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6220,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And no odor of mignonette there is,"
6221,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,But the breath of morn on the dewy lawn;
6222,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And mayhap from causes as slight as this
6223,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,The quaint old legend is born.
6224,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6225,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"But the soul of that subtle, sad perfume,"
6226,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"As the spiced embalmings, they say, outlast"
6227,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"The mummy laid in his rocky tomb,"
6228,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,Awakens my buried past.
6229,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6230,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And I think of the passion that shook my youth,"
6231,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Of its aimless loves and its idle pains,"
6232,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And am thankful now for the certain truth
6233,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,That only the sweet remains.
6234,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6235,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade,"
6236,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,And I see no face at my library door;
6237,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid,"
6238,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,She is viewless for evermore.
6239,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,
6240,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"But whether she came as a faint perfume,"
6241,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"Or whether a spirit in stole of white,"
6242,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,"I feel, as I pass from the darkened room,"
6243,A NEWPORT ROMANCE,She has been with my soul to-night!

6836,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Or love philter, not in the regular Pharm-"
6837,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Acopoeia, and thus, from pure malice prepense,"
6838,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Had bewitched and bamboozled the young lady's sense;
6839,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Others thought, with more reason, the secret to lie"
6840,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),In a magical wash or indelible dye;
6841,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"While Society, with its censorious eye"
6842,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And judgment impartial, stood ready to damn"
6843,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),What wasn't improper as being a sham.
6844,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6845,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),For a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog
6846,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"With a party, the finest the season had seen,"
6847,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"To be given in honor of Miss Pollywog,"
6848,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen.
6849,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The guests were invited; but one night before
6850,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),A carriage drew up at the modest back door
6851,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Of Brown's lab'ratory, and, full in the glare"
6852,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Of a big purple bottle, some closely veiled fair"
6853,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Alighted and entered: to make matters plain,"
6854,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Spite of veils and disguises, 'twas Addie De Laine."
6855,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6856,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"As a bower for true love, 'twas hardly the one"
6857,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),That a lady would choose to be wooed in or won:
6858,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),No odor of rose or sweet jessamine's sigh
6859,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by,"
6860,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme;
6861,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"But the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime,"
6862,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And salts, which your chemist delights to explain"
6863,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),As the base of the smell of the rose and the drain.
6864,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Think of this, O ye lovers of sweetness! and know"
6865,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),What you smell when you snuff up Lubin or Pinaud.
6866,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6867,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"I pass by the greetings, the transports and bliss,"
6868,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Which of course duly followed a meeting like this,"
6869,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And come down to business,--for such the intent"
6870,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Of the lady who now o'er the crucible leant,"
6871,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"In the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime,"
6872,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Like a fairy called up in the new pantomime,--"
6873,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And give but her words, as she coyly looked down"
6874,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),In reply to the questioning glances of Brown:
6875,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"""I am taking the drops, and am using the paste,"
6876,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And the little white powders that had a sweet taste,"
6877,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye,"
6878,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And the depilatory, and also the dye,"
6879,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And I'm charmed with the trial; and now, my dear Brown,"
6880,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"I have one other favor,--now, ducky, don't frown,--"
6881,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Only one, for a chemist and genius like you"
6882,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"But a trifle, and one you can easily do."
6883,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Now listen: to-morrow, you know, is the night"
6884,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Of the birthday soiree of that Pollywog fright;
6885,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And I'm to be there, and the dress I shall wear"
6886,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Is TOO lovely; but""--  ""But what then, ma chere?"""
6887,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Said Brown, as the lady came to a full stop,"
6888,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),And glanced round the shelves of the little back shop.
6889,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"""Well, I want--I want something to fill out the skirt"
6890,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"To the proper dimensions, without being girt"
6891,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"In a stiff crinoline, or caged in a hoop"
6892,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),That shows through one's skirt like the bars of a coop;
6893,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Something light, that a lady may waltz in, or polk,"
6894,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),With a freedom that none but you masculine folk
6895,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Ever know.  For, however poor woman aspires,"
6896,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),She's always bound down to the earth by these wires.
6897,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Are you listening?  Nonsense! don't stare like a spoon,"
6898,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Idiotic; some light thing, and spacious, and soon--"
6899,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Something like--well, in fact--something like a balloon!"""
6900,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6901,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Here she paused; and here Brown, overcome by surprise,"
6902,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes,"
6903,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),And the lady departed.  But just at the door
6904,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Something happened,--'tis true, it had happened before"
6905,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"In this sanctum of science,--a sibilant sound,"
6906,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Like some element just from its trammels unbound,"
6907,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Or two substances that their affinities found.
6908,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6909,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The night of the anxiously looked for soiree
6910,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Had come, with its fair ones in gorgeous array;"
6911,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"With the rattle of wheels and the tinkle of bells,"
6912,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And the ""How do ye do's"" and the ""Hope you are well's;"""
6913,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And the crush in the passage, and last lingering look"
6914,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),You give as you hang your best hat on the hook;
6915,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The rush of hot air as the door opens wide;
6916,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And your entry,--that blending of self-possessed pride"
6917,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),And humility shown in your perfect-bred stare
6918,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"At the folk, as if wondering how they got there;"
6919,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),With other tricks worthy of Vanity Fair.
6920,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Meanwhile, the safe topic, the beat of the room,"
6921,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Already was losing its freshness and bloom;
6922,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Young people were yawning, and wondering when"
6923,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The dance would come off; and why didn't it then:
6924,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"When a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd,"
6925,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Lo! the door swung its hinges with utterance proud!
6926,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And Pompey announced, with a trumpet-like strain,"
6927,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The entrance of Brown and Miss Addie De Laine.
6928,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6929,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),She entered; but oh! how imperfect the verb
6930,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),To express to the senses her movement superb!
6931,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"To say that she ""sailed in"" more clearly might tell"
6932,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell.
6933,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Her robe was a vague circumambient space,"
6934,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),With shadowy boundaries made of point-lace;
6935,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"The rest was but guesswork, and well might defy"
6936,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The power of critical feminine eye
6937,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),To define or describe: 'twere as futile to try
6938,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"The gossamer web of the cirrus to trace,"
6939,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky.
6940,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6941,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),'Midst the humming of praises and glances of beaux
6942,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"That greet our fair maiden wherever she goes,"
6943,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Brown slipped like a shadow, grim, silent, and black,"
6944,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"With a look of anxiety, close in her track."
6945,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Once he whispered aside in her delicate ear
6946,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"A sentence of warning,--it might be of fear:"
6947,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"""Don't stand in a draught, if you value your life."""
6948,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"(Nothing more,--such advice might be given your wife"
6949,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Or your sweetheart, in times of bronchitis and cough,"
6950,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Without mystery, romance, or frivolous scoff.)"
6951,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),But hark to the music; the dance has begun.
6952,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),The closely draped windows wide open are flung;
6953,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"The notes of the piccolo, joyous and light,"
6954,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night.
6955,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Round about go the dancers; in circles they fly;
6956,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Trip, trip, go their feet as their skirts eddy by;"
6957,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And swifter and lighter, but somewhat too plain,"
6958,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Whisks the fair circumvolving Miss Addie De Laine.
6959,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Taglioni and Cerito well might have pined
6960,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),For the vigor and ease that her movements combined;
6961,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),E'en Rigelboche never flung higher her robe
6962,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),In the naughtiest city that's known on the globe.
6963,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"'Twas amazing, 'twas scandalous; lost in surprise,"
6964,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Some opened their mouths, and a few shut their eyes."
6965,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6966,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"But hark!  At the moment Miss Addie De Laine,"
6967,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse
6968,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Which brought her fair form to the window again,"
6969,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),From the arms of her partner incautiously slips!
6970,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And a shriek fills the air, and the music is still,"
6971,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),And the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn
6972,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Still frenziedly points from the wide window-sill
6973,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Into space and the night; for Miss Addie was gone!
6974,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun;
6975,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Gone like the grain when the reaper is done;
6976,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass;
6977,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Gone without parting farewell; and alas!
6978,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Gone with a flavor of hydrogen gas!
6979,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),
6980,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"When the weather is pleasant, you frequently meet"
6981,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),A white-headed man slowly pacing the street;
6982,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"His trembling hand shading his lack-lustre eye,"
6983,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Half blind with continually scanning the sky.
6984,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Rumor points him as some astronomical sage,"
6985,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),Re-perusing by day the celestial page;
6986,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"But the reader, sagacious, will recognize Brown,"
6987,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"Trying vainly to conjure his lost sweetheart down,"
6988,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),"And learn the stern moral this story must teach,"
6989,(A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE),That Genius may lift its love out of its reach.

7017,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Unfinished there,"
7018,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,In high mid-air
7019,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The towers halt like a broken prayer;
7020,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Through years belated,"
7021,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Unconsummated,"
7022,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The hope of its architect quite frustrated.
7023,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Its very youth
7024,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"They say, forsooth,"
7025,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,With a quite improper purpose mated;
7026,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And every stone
7027,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,With a curse of its own
7028,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Instead of that sermon Shakespeare stated,"
7029,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Since the day its choir,"
7030,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Which all admire,"
7031,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,By Cologne's Archbishop was consecrated.
7032,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7033,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Ah! THAT was a day,"
7034,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"One well might say,"
7035,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"To be marked with the largest, whitest stone"
7036,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To be found in the towers of all Cologne!
7037,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Along the Rhine,"
7038,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"From old Rheinstein,"
7039,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The people flowed like their own good wine.
7040,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"From Rudesheim,"
7041,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And Geisenheim,"
7042,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And every spot that is known to rhyme;
7043,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"From the famed Cat's Castle of St. Goarshausen,"
7044,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"To the pictured roofs of Assmannshausen,"
7045,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And down the track,"

7052,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"The folk flowed in, and Ober-Cassel"

7054,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And pouring in from near and far,"
7055,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"As the Rhine to its bosom draws the Ahr,"
7056,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Or takes the arm of the sober Mosel,"
7057,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"So in Cologne, knight, squire, and losel,"
7058,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Choked up the city's gates with men
7059,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,From old St. Stephen to Zint Marjen.
7060,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7061,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,What had they come to see?  Ah me!
7062,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"I fear no glitter of pageantry,"
7063,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Nor sacred zeal
7064,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"For Church's weal,"

7068,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Still in each nest
7069,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,On every crest
7070,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Kept stolen goods in their possession;
7071,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,But only their gout
7072,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"For something new,"
7073,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"More rare than the ""roast"" of a wandering Jew;"
7074,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Or--to be exact--
7075,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To see--in fact--
7076,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"A Christian soul, in the very act"
7077,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of being damned, secundum artem,"
7078,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"By the devil, before a soul could part 'em."

7080,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,For a rumor had flown
7081,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Throughout Cologne
7082,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"That the church, in fact, was the devil's own;"
7083,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,That its architect
7084,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"(Being long ""suspect"")"
7085,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Had confessed to the Bishop that he had wrecked
7086,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Not only his OWN soul, but had lost"
7087,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The VERY FIRST CHRISTIAN SOUL that crossed
7088,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"The sacred threshold: and all, in fine,"
7089,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,For that very beautiful design
7090,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Of the wonderful choir
7091,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,They were pleased to admire.
7092,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And really, he must be allowed to say--"
7093,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To speak in a purely business way--
7094,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"That, taking the ruling market prices"
7095,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of souls and churches, in such a crisis"
7096,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,It would be shown--
7097,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And his Grace must own--
7098,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,It was really a BARGAIN for Cologne!
7099,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7100,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Such was the tale
7101,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,That turned cheeks pale
7102,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"With the thought that the enemy might prevail,"
7103,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And the church doors snap
7104,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,With a thunderclap
7105,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,On a Christian soul in that devil's trap.
7106,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"But a wiser few,"
7107,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Who thought that they knew
7108,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Cologne's Archbishop, replied, ""Pooh, pooh!"
7109,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Just watch him and wait,"
7110,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And as sure as fate,"
7111,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"You'll find that the Bishop will give checkmate."""
7112,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7113,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,One here might note
7114,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"How the popular vote,"
7115,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"As shown in all legends and anecdote,"
7116,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Declares that a breach
7117,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Of trust to o'erreach
7118,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The devil is something quite proper for each.
7119,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And, really, if you"
7120,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Give the devil his due
7121,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,In spite of the proverb--it's something you'll rue.
7122,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"But to lie and deceive him,"
7123,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"To use and to leave him,"
7124,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"From Job up to Faust is the way to receive him,"

7132,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,It is the hour!
7133,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"The host pours in, in its pomp and power"
7134,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of banners and pyx,"
7135,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And high crucifix,"
7136,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And crosiers and other processional sticks,"
7137,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And no end of Marys
7138,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"In quaint reliquaries,"
7139,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To gladden the souls of all true antiquaries;
7140,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And an Osculum Pacis
7141,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,(A myth to the masses
7142,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Who trusted their bones more to mail and cuirasses)--
7143,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,All borne by the throng
7144,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Who are marching along
7145,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"To the square of the Dom with processional song,"
7146,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"With the flaring of dips,"
7147,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And bending of hips,"
7148,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And the chanting of hundred perfunctory lips;
7149,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And some good little boys
7150,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Who had come up from Neuss
7151,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And the Quirinuskirche to show off their voice:
7152,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,All march to the square
7153,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the great Dom, and there"
7154,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"File right and left, leaving alone and quite bare"
7155,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"A covered sedan,"
7156,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Containing--so ran
7157,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The rumor--the victim to take off the ban.
7158,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7159,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"They have left it alone,"
7160,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,They have sprinkled each stone
7161,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the porch with a sanctified Eau de Cologne,"
7162,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Guaranteed in this case
7163,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To disguise every trace
7164,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Of a sulphurous presence in that sacred place.
7165,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Two Carmelites stand
7166,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,On the right and left hand
7167,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the covered sedan chair, to wait the command"
7168,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Of the prelate to throw
7169,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Up the cover and show
7170,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The form of the victim in terror below.
7171,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"There's a pause and a prayer,"
7172,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Then the signal, and there--"
7173,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Is a WOMAN!--by all that is good and is fair!

7178,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"As a martyr, or e'en"
7179,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,As a Christian!  A queen

7181,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,So bad that the worst
7182,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of Cologne spake up first,"
7183,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And declared 'twas an outrage to suffer one curst,"
7184,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,And already a fief
7185,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the Satanic chief,"
7186,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,To martyr herself for the Church's relief.
7187,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,But in vain fell their sneer
7188,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"On the mob, who I fear"
7189,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,On the whole felt a strong disposition to cheer.
7190,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7191,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,A woman! and there
7192,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,She stands in the glare
7193,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the pitiless sun and their pitying stare,--"
7194,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"A woman still young,"

7203,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7204,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,She moves.  She has gone
7205,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,From their pity and scorn;
7206,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,She has mounted alone
7207,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"The first step of stone,"
7208,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"And the high swinging doors she wide open has thrown,"
7209,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Then pauses and turns,"
7210,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,As the altar blaze burns
7211,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"On her cheeks, and with one sudden gesture she spurns"
7212,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Archbishop and Prior,"
7213,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Knight, ladye, and friar,"

7216,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"""O men of Cologne!"

7231,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7232,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,She paused.  Yet aloof
7233,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,They all stand.  No reproof
7234,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Breaks the silence that fills the celestial roof.
7235,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,One instant--no more--
7236,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"She halts at the door,"
7237,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Then enters!... A flood from the roof to the floor
7238,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Fills the church rosy red.
7239,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,She is gone!
7240,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"But instead,"
7241,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Who is this leaning forward with glorified head

7243,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Sure this is no slave
7244,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Of the Powers of Darkness, with aspect so brave!"
7245,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7246,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"They press to the door,"
7247,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,But too late!  All is o'er.
7248,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Naught remains but a woman's form prone on the floor;
7249,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,But they still see a trace
7250,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Of that glow in her face
7251,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,That they saw in the light of the altar's high blaze
7252,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,On the image that stands
7253,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,With the babe in its hands
7254,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Enshrined in the churches of all Christian lands.
7255,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7256,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"A Te Deum sung,"

7263,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,A soul in abusing
7264,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"The Evil One's faith, they gained one of his choosing."
7265,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,
7266,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,Thus the legend is told:

7268,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"Vaulted aisles of the Dom, stiff in marble or cold"
7269,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"In iron and brass,"

7274,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,The image of Mary Madonna the blest.
7275,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"But you look round in vain,"
7276,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,"On each high pictured pane,"
7277,A LEGEND OF COLOGNE,For the woman most worthy to walk in her train.

7947,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,And draw your cinch up tighter till the sweat drops from the ring:
7948,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,We've a dozen miles to cover ere we reach the next divide.
7949,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Our limbs are stiffer now than when we first set out to ride,"
7950,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And worse, the horses know it, and feel the leg-grip tire,"
7951,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Since in the days when, long ago, we sought the old camp-fire."
7952,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7953,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Yes, twenty years!  Lord! how we'd scent its incense down the trail,"
7954,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Through balm of bay and spice of spruce, when eye and ear would fail,"
7955,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And worn and faint from useless quest we crept, like this, to rest,"
7956,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Or, flushed with luck and youthful hope, we rode, like this, abreast."
7957,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Ay! straighten up, old friend, and let the mustang think he's nigher,"
7958,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Through looser rein and stirrup strain, the welcome old camp-fire."
7959,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7960,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"You know the shout that would ring out before us down the glade,"
7961,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And start the blue jays like a flight of arrows through the shade,"
7962,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And sift the thin pine needles down like slanting, shining rain,"
7963,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And send the squirrels scampering back to their holes again,"
7964,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Until we saw, blue-veiled and dim, or leaping like desire,"
7965,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"That flame of twenty years ago, which lit the old camp-fire."
7966,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7967,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And then that rest on Nature's breast, when talk had dropped, and slow"
7968,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,The night wind went from tree to tree with challenge soft and low!
7969,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"We lay on lazy elbows propped, or stood to stir the flame,"
7970,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Till up the soaring redwood's shaft our shadows danced and came,"
7971,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"As if to draw us with the sparks, high o'er its unseen spire,"
7972,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"To the five stars that kept their ward above the old camp-fire,--"
7973,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7974,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Those picket stars whose tranquil watch half soothed, half shamed"
7975,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,our sleep.
7976,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,What recked we then what beasts or men around might lurk or creep?
7977,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"We lay and heard with listless ears the far-off panther's cry,"
7978,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"The near coyote's snarling snap, the grizzly's deep-drawn sigh,"

7980,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,choir
7981,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Beyond the magic circle drawn around the old camp-fire.
7982,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7983,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,And then that morn!  Was ever morn so filled with all things new?
7984,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,The light that fell through long brown aisles from out the kindling
7985,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"blue,"
7986,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"The creak and yawn of stretching boughs, the jay-bird's early call,"
7987,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"The rat-tat-tat of woodpecker that waked the woodland hall,"
7988,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"The fainter stir of lower life in fern and brake and brier,"
7989,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Till flashing leaped the torch of Day from last night's old camp-fire!
7990,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7991,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Well, well! we'll see it once again; we should be near it now;"
7992,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"It's scarce a mile to where the trail strikes off to skirt the slough,"
7993,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And then the dip to Indian Spring, the wooded rise, and--strange!"
7994,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Yet here should stand the blasted pine that marked our farther range;
7995,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,And here--what's this?  A ragged swab of ruts and stumps and mire!
7996,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Sure this is not the sacred grove that hid the old camp-fire!
7997,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
7998,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Yet here's the ""blaze"" I cut myself, and there's the stumbling ledge,"
7999,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"With quartz ""outcrop"" that lay atop, now leveled to its edge,"
8000,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And mounds of moss-grown stumps beside the woodman's rotting chips,"
8001,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And gashes in the hillside, that gape with dumb red lips."
8002,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"And yet above the shattered wreck and ruin, curling higher--"
8003,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Ah yes!--still lifts the smoke that marked the welcome old camp-fire!
8004,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
8005,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Perhaps some friend of twenty years still lingers there to raise
8006,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,To weary hearts and tired eyes that beacon of old days.
8007,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Perhaps but stay; 'tis gone! and yet once more it lifts as though
8008,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"To meet our tardy blundering steps, and seems to MOVE, and lo!"
8009,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Whirls by us in a rush of sound,--the vanished funeral pyre"
8010,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Of hopes and fears that twenty years burned in the old camp-fire!
8011,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,
8012,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"For see, beyond the prospect spreads, with chimney, spire, and roof,--"
8013,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Two iron bands across the trail clank to our mustang's hoof;
8014,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,"Above them leap two blackened threads from limb-lopped tree to tree,"
8015,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,To where the whitewashed station speeds its message to the sea.
8016,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Rein in!  Rein in!  The quest is o'er.  The goal of our desire
8017,THE OLD CAMP-FIRE,Is but the train whose track has lain across the old camp-fire!

8026,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Twelve years of platform, and before them stretching"

8028,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8029,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"North, south, east, west,--the same dull gray persistence,"
8030,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"The tattered vapors of a vanished train,"
8031,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"The narrowing rails that meet to pierce the distance,"
8032,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Or break the columns of the far-off rain.
8033,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8034,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Naught but myself; nor form nor figure breaking
8035,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,The long hushed level and stark shining waste;
8036,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Nothing that moves to fill the vision aching,"
8037,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,When the last shadow fled in sullen haste.
8038,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8039,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Nothing beyond.  Ah yes!  From out the station
8040,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"A stiff, gaunt figure thrown against the sky,"
8041,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Beckoning me with some wooden salutation
8042,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Caught from his signals as the train flashed by;
8043,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8044,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Yielding me place beside him with dumb gesture
8045,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Born of that reticence of sky and air.
8046,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"We sit apart, yet wrapped in that one vesture"
8047,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Of silence, sadness, and unspoken care:"
8048,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8049,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Each following his own thought,--around us darkening"
8050,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"The rain-washed boundaries and stretching track,--"
8051,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Each following those dim parallels and hearkening
8052,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,For long-lost voices that will not come back.
8053,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8054,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Until, unasked,--I knew not why or wherefore,--"
8055,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"He yielded, bit by bit, his dreary past,"
8056,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Like gathered clouds that seemed to thicken there for
8057,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Some dull down-dropping of their care at last.
8058,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8059,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Long had he lived there.  As a boy had started
8060,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,From the stacked corn the Indian's painted face;
8061,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Heard the wolves' howl the wearying waste that parted
8062,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,His father's hut from the last camping-place.
8063,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8064,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Nature had mocked him: thrice had claimed the reaping,"
8065,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"With scythe of fire, of lands she once had sown;"
8066,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Sent the tornado, round his hearthstone heaping"
8067,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Rafters, dead faces that were like his own."
8068,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8069,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Then came the War Time.  When its shadow beckoned
8070,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,He had walked dumbly where the flag had led
8071,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Through swamp and fen,--unknown, unpraised, unreckoned,--"
8072,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"To famine, fever, and a prison bed."

8076,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"Here, at his watch, gave him the chance of earning"
8077,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Scant means to live--who won the right to die.
8078,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8079,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,All this I heard--or seemed to hear--half blending
8080,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"With the low murmur of the coming breeze,"
8081,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,"The call of some lost bird, and the unending"
8082,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,And tireless sobbing of those grassy seas.
8083,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,
8084,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Until at last the spell of desolation
8085,THE STATION-MASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE,Broke with a trembling star and far-off cry.

8292,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,
8293,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"A. D. Five Hundred and Fifty-two,"

8301,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,
8302,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,For the streets of the town--as you'll see to-day--
8303,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,Were twisted and curved in a curious way

8305,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,And the longest bolt that a Saxon drew
8306,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"Was stopped ere a dozen of yards it flew,"
8307,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"By a turn in the street, and a law so true"
8308,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,That even these robbers--of all laws scorners!--
8309,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,Knew you couldn't shoot arrows AROUND street corners.
8310,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,

8319,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,

8327,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,With legs as vague as the Queen of Spain's;
8328,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,
8329,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,And the dashing swift that would ricochet

8332,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"New life from the earth, barely touched by his wing;"
8333,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,And the swallow and martlet that always knew
8334,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,The straightest way home.  Here a Saxon churl drew
8335,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,His breath--tapped his forehead--an idea had got through!
8336,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,
8337,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"So they brought them some nets, which straightway they filled"
8338,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,With the swallows and martlets--the sweet birds who build

8340,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,Who sing at their labor on eaves and in thatch--
8341,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,And they stuck on their feathers a rude lighted match
8342,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,Made of resin and tow.  Then they let them all go
8343,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"To be free!  As a child-like diversion?  Ah, no!"
8344,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,To work Cirencester's red ruin and woe.
8345,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,

8348,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,And straighter than arrow of Saxon e'er sped
8349,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"They shot o'er the curving streets, high overhead,"
8350,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"Bringing fire and terror to roof tree and bed,"
8351,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,"Till the town broke in flame, wherever they came,"
8352,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,To the Briton's red ruin--the Saxon's red shame!
8353,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,
8354,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,Yet they're all gone together!  To-day you'll dig up

8357,THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER,'Neath the feet of the race they have mixed with and blended.

9543,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"It was spring the first time that I saw her, for her papa and mamma"
9544,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,moved in
9545,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"Next door, just as skating was over, and marbles about to begin;"
9546,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"For the fence in our back yard was broken, and I saw, as I peeped"
9547,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"through the slat,"
9548,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"There were ""Johnny-jump-ups"" all around her, and I knew it was"
9549,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,spring just by that.
9550,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,
9551,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"I never knew whether she saw me, for she didn't say nothing to me,"
9552,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"But ""Ma! here's a slat in the fence broke, and the boy that is next"
9553,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"door can see."""
9554,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"But the next day I climbed on our wood-shed, as you know Mamma says"
9555,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"I've a right,"
9556,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And she calls out, ""Well, peekin' is manners!"" and I answered her,"
9557,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"""Sass is perlite!"""
9558,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,
9559,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"But I wasn't a bit mad, no, Papa, and to prove it, the very next day,"
9560,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,When she ran past our fence in the morning I happened to get in her
9561,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"way,--"
9562,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"For you know I am ""chunked"" and clumsy, as she says are all boys of"
9563,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"my size,--"
9564,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And she nearly upset me, she did, Pa, and laughed till tears came in"
9565,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,her eyes.
9566,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,
9567,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And then we were friends from that moment, for I knew that she told"
9568,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"Kitty Sage,--"
9569,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And she wasn't a girl that would flatter--""that she thought I was"
9570,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"tall for my age."""
9571,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And I gave her four apples that evening, and took her to ride on my"
9572,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"sled,"
9573,MASTER JOHNNY'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,"And--  ""What am I telling you this for?""  Why, Papa, my neighbor is"
9574,DEAD!,DEAD!
9575,DEAD!,
9576,DEAD!,"You don't hear one half I am saying,--I really do think it's too bad!"
9577,DEAD!,"Why, you might have seen crape on her door-knob, and noticed to-day"
9578,DEAD!,I've been sad.
9579,DEAD!,"And they've got her a coffin of rosewood, and they say they have"
9580,DEAD!,"dressed her in white,"
9581,DEAD!,"And I've never once looked through the fence, Pa, since she died--at"
9582,DEAD!,eleven last night.
9583,DEAD!,
9584,DEAD!,"And Ma says it's decent and proper, as I was her neighbor and friend,"
9585,DEAD!,"That I should go there to the funeral, and she thinks that YOU ought"
9586,DEAD!,to attend;
9587,DEAD!,"But I am so clumsy and awkward, I know I shall be in the way,"
9588,DEAD!,"And suppose they should speak to me, Papa, I wouldn't know just what"
9589,DEAD!,to say.
9590,DEAD!,
9591,DEAD!,"So I think I will get up quite early,--I know I sleep late, but I know"
9592,DEAD!,I'll be sure to wake up if our Bridget pulls the string that I'll tie
9593,DEAD!,to my toe;
9594,DEAD!,"And I'll crawl through the fence, and I'll gather the ""Johnny-jump-ups"""
9595,DEAD!,as they grew
9596,DEAD!,"Round her feet the first day that I saw her, and, Papa, I'll give"
9597,DEAD!,them to you.
9598,DEAD!,
9599,DEAD!,"For you're a big man, and, you know, Pa, can come and go just where"
9600,DEAD!,"you choose,"
9601,DEAD!,"And you'll take the flowers in to her, and surely they'll never"
9602,DEAD!,refuse;
9603,DEAD!,"But, Papa, don't SAY they're from Johnny; THEY won't understand,"
9604,DEAD!,don't you see?
9605,DEAD!,"But just lay them down on her bosom, and, Papa, SHE'LL know they're"

9617,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"So I guess you're like me when I talk, and I talk, and I talk all"
9618,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"the day,"
9619,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And they only say, ""Do stop that child!"" or, ""Nurse, take Miss Edith"
9620,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"away."""
9621,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9622,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,But Papa said if I was good I could ask you--alone by myself--
9623,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,If you wouldn't write me a book like that little one up on the shelf.
9624,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"I don't mean the pictures, of course, for to make THEM you've got to"
9625,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,be smart
9626,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"But the reading that runs all around them, you know,--just the"
9627,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,easiest part.
9628,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9629,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"You needn't mind what it's about, for no one will see it but me,"
9630,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And Jane,--that's my nurse,--and John,--he's the coachman,--just"
9631,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,only us three.
9632,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"You're to write of a bad little girl, that was wicked and bold and"
9633,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,all that;
9634,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And then you're to write, if you please, something good--very good--"
9635,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,of a cat!
9636,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9637,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"This cat, she was virtuous and meek, and kind to her parents, and"
9638,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"mild,"
9639,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And careful and neat in her ways, though her mistress was such a bad"
9640,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,child;
9641,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,And hours she would sit and would gaze when her mistress--that's me--
9642,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"was so bad,"
9643,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And blink, just as if she would say, ""Oh, Edith! you make my heart"
9644,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"sad."""
9645,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9646,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And yet, you would scarcely believe it, that beautiful, angelic cat"
9647,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Was blamed by the servants for stealing whatever, they said, she'd"
9648,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,get at.
9649,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And when John drank my milk,--don't you tell me!  I know just the"
9650,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"way it was done,--"
9651,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"They said 'twas the cat,--and she sitting and washing her face in"
9652,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,the sun!
9653,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9654,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And then there was Dick, my canary.  When I left its cage open one"
9655,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"day,"
9656,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"They all made believe that she ate it, though I know that the bird"
9657,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,flew away.
9658,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,And why?  Just because she was playing with a feather she found on
9659,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,the floor.
9660,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,As if cats couldn't play with a feather without people thinking
9661,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,'twas more!
9662,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9663,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Why, once we were romping together, when I knocked down a vase from"
9664,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"the shelf,"
9665,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,That cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself;
9666,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And she walked away sadly and hid herself, and never came out until"
9667,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"tea,--"
9668,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"So they say, for they sent ME to bed, and she never came even to me."
9669,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9670,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"No matter whatever happened, it was laid at the door of that cat."
9671,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Why, once when I tore my apron,--she was wrapped in it, and I called"
9672,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"""Rat!""--"
9673,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Why, they blamed that on HER.  I shall never--no, not to my dying"
9674,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,day--
9675,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,Forget the pained look that she gave me when they slapped ME and
9676,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,took me away.
9677,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9678,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Of course, you know just what comes next, when a child is as lovely"
9679,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,as that:
9680,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,She wasted quite slowly away; it was goodness was killing that cat.
9681,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"I know it was nothing she ate, for her taste was exceedingly nice;"
9682,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"But they said she stole Bobby's ice cream, and caught a bad cold"
9683,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,from the ice.
9684,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9685,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,And you'll promise to make me a book like that little one up on the
9686,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"shelf,"
9687,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And you'll call her ""Naomi,"" because it's a name that she just gave"
9688,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,herself;
9689,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"For she'd scratch at my door in the morning, and whenever I'd call"
9690,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"out, ""Who's there?"""
9691,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"She would answer, ""Naomi! Naomi!"" like a Christian, I vow and declare."
9692,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,
9693,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And you'll put me and her in a book.  And mind, you're to say I was"
9694,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,bad;
9695,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,And I might have been badder than that but for the example I had.
9696,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"And you'll say that she was a Maltese, and--what's that you asked?"
9697,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"""Is she dead?"""
9698,MISS EDITH'S MODEST REQUEST,"Why, please, sir, THERE AIN'T ANY CAT!  You're to make one up out of"

9851,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"I might SEE what I HEARD then, that sounded so plain--"
9852,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,Like when my wet fingers I rub on the pane
9853,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,(Which they won't let ME do on my window).
9854,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9855,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"And I'd know why papa shut the door with a slam,"
9856,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"And said something funny that sounded like ""jam,"""
9857,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"And then ""Edith--where are you?""  I said, ""Here I am."""
9858,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"""Ah, that's right, dear, look out of the window!"""
9859,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9860,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,They say when I'm grown up these things will appear
9861,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"More plain than they do when I look at them here,"
9862,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"But I think I see some things uncommonly clear,"
9863,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,As I sit and look down from the window.
9864,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9865,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"What things?  Oh, the things that I make up, you know,"
9866,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,Out of stories I've read--and they all pass below.
9867,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"Ali Baba, the Forty Thieves, all in a row,"
9868,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"Go by, as I look from my window."
9869,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9870,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,That's only at church time; other days there's no crowd.
9871,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,Don't laugh!  See that big man who looked up and bowed?
9872,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,That's our butcher--I call him the Sultan Mahoud
9873,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,When he nods to me here at the window!
9874,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9875,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,And THAT man--he's our neighbor--just gone for a ride
9876,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,Has three wives in the churchyard that lie side by side.
9877,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"So I call him ""Bluebeard"" in search of his bride,"
9878,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,While I'm Sister Anne at the window.
9879,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9880,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"And what do I call you?  Well, here's what I DO:"
9881,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"When my sister expects you, she puts me here, too;"
9882,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"But I wait till you enter, to see if it's you,"
9883,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,And then--I just OPEN the window!
9884,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,
9885,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"""Dear child!""  Yes, that's me!  ""Oh, you ask what that's for?"
9886,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"Well, Papa says you're 'Poverty's self,' and what's more,"
9887,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"I open the window, when YOU'RE at the door,"
9888,WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW,"To see Love fly out of the window!"""

9987,NOTES,THE LOST GALLEON.  As the custom on which the central incident of
9988,NOTES,"this legend is based may not be familiar to all readers, I will"
9989,NOTES,repeat here that it is the habit of navigators to drop a day from
9990,NOTES,their calendar in crossing westerly the 180th degree of longitude of
9991,NOTES,"Greenwich, adding a day in coming east; and that the idea of the"
9992,NOTES,lost galleon had an origin as prosaic as the log of the first China
9993,NOTES,Mail Steamer from San Francisco.  The explanation of the custom and
9994,NOTES,its astronomical relations belongs rather to the usual text-books
9995,NOTES,than to poetical narration.  If any reader thinks I have overdrawn
9996,NOTES,"the credulous superstitions of the ancient navigators, I refer him"
9997,NOTES,"to the veracious statements of Maldonado, De Fonte, the later"
9998,NOTES,"voyages of La Perouse and Anson, and the charts of 1640.  In the"
9999,NOTES,charts of that day Spanish navigators reckoned longitude E. 360
10000,NOTES,degrees from the meridian of the Isle of Ferro.  For the sake of
10001,NOTES,"perspicuity before a modern audience, the more recent meridian of"
10002,NOTES,Madrid was substituted.  The custom of dropping a day at some
10003,NOTES,"arbitrary point in crossing the Pacific westerly, I need not say,"
10004,NOTES,remains unaffected by any change of meridian.  I know not if any
10005,NOTES,galleon was ever really missing.  For two hundred and fifty years an
10006,NOTES,annual trip was made between Acapulco and Manila.  It may be some
10007,NOTES,satisfaction to the more severely practical of my readers to know
10008,NOTES,"that, according to the best statistics of insurance, the loss during"
10009,NOTES,that period would be exactly three vessels and six hundredths of a
10010,NOTES,"vessel, which would certainly justify me in this summary disposition"
10011,NOTES,of ONE.

10013,NOTES,THE PLIOCENE SKULL.  This extraordinary fossil is in the possession
10014,NOTES,"of Prof. Josiah D. Whitney, of the State Geological Survey of"
10015,NOTES,California.  The poem was based on the following paragraph from the
10016,NOTES,"daily press of 1868: ""A human skull has been found in California, in"
10017,NOTES,the pliocene formation.  This skull is the remnant not only of the
10018,NOTES,"earliest pioneer of this State, but the oldest known human being...."
10019,NOTES,"The skull was found in a shaft 150 feet deep, two miles from Angels"
10020,NOTES,"in Calaveras County, by a miner named James Watson, who gave it to"
10021,NOTES,"Mr. Scribner, a merchant, who gave it to Dr. Jones, who sent it to"
10022,NOTES,the State Geological Survey....  The published volume of the
10023,NOTES,State Survey of the Geology of California states that man existed
10024,NOTES,"here contemporaneously with the mastodon, but this fossil proves"
10025,NOTES,"that he was here before the mastodon was known to exist."""
