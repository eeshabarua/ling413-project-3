477,II,
478,II,_Dusk deepens. A whippoorwill calls._
479,II,
480,II,The whippoorwills are calling where
481,II,The golden west is graying;
482,II,"“’Tis time,” they say, “to meet him there--"
483,II,Why are you still delaying?
484,II,
485,II,“He waits you where the old beech throws
486,II,Its gnarly shadow over
487,II,"Wood violet and the bramble rose,"
488,II,Frail lady-fern and clover.
489,II,
490,II,“Where elder and the sumac peep
491,II,"Above your garden’s paling,"
492,II,"Whereon, at noon, the lizards sleep,"
493,II,Like lichen on the railing.
494,II,
495,II,“Come! ere the early rising moon’s
496,II,Gold floods the violet valleys;
497,II,"Where mists, like phantom picaroons"
498,II,Anchor their stealthy galleys.
499,II,
500,II,“Come! while the deepening amethyst
501,II,Of dusk above is falling--
502,II,’Tis time to tryst! ’tis time to tryst!”
503,II,The whippoorwills are calling.
504,II,
505,II,They call you to these twilight ways
506,II,With dewy odor dripping--
507,II,"Ah, girlhood, through the rosy haze"
508,II,Come like a moonbeam slipping.

512,III,
513,III,"_He enters the garden, speaking dreamily_:"
514,III,
515,III,"There is a fading inward of the day,"
516,III,And all the pansy sunset clasps one star;
517,III,"The twilight acres, eastward, glimmer gray,"
518,III,While all the world to westward smoulders far.
519,III,
520,III,Now to your glass will you pass for the last time?
521,III,"Pass! humming some ballad, I know."
522,III,Here where I wait it is late and is past time--
523,III,"Late! and the moments are slow, are slow."
524,III,
525,III,There is a drawing downward of the night;
526,III,The bridegroom Heaven bends down to kiss the moon:
527,III,"Above, the heights hang silver in her light;"
528,III,"Below, the vales stretch purple, deep with June."
529,III,
530,III,There in the dew is it you hiding lawny?
531,III,You? or a moth in the vines?--
532,III,You!--by your hand! where the band twinkles tawny!
533,III,"You!--by your ring, like a glow-worm that shines!"

549,IV,Why! is your love so poor?
550,IV,
551,IV,_He_
552,IV,
553,IV,No. Yet you _might_ deceive me!
554,IV,
555,IV,_She_
556,IV,
557,IV,As many a girl before.--
558,IV,"Ah, dear, you will forgive me?"

561,IV,
562,IV,"Say no more, sweet, say no more!"
563,IV,
564,IV,_She_
565,IV,
566,IV,"Love trusts; and that’s enough, my dear."
567,IV,"Trust wins through love; whereof, my dear,"
568,IV,"Love holds through trust: and love, my dear,"
569,IV,Is--all my life and lore.
570,IV,
571,IV,_He_
572,IV,

582,IV,
583,IV,_He_
584,IV,
585,IV,"More sweet the dusk for this is,"
586,IV,For lips that meet in kisses.--
587,IV,Come! come! why run from blisses

593,V,"_She stands smiling at him, shyly, then speaks_:"
594,V,
595,V,How many words in the asking!
596,V,How easily I can grieve you!--
597,V,"My “yes” in a “no” was a-masking,"
598,V,"Nor thought, dear, to deceive you.--"
599,V,A kiss?--the humming-bird happiness here
600,V,"In my heart consents.... But what are words,"
601,V,When the thought of two souls in speech accords?
602,V,"Affirmative, negative--what are they, dear?"
603,V,"I wished to say “yes,” but somehow said “no.”"
604,V,"The woman within me knew you would know,"
605,V,Knew that your heart would hear.
606,V,
607,V,_He speaks_:
608,V,
609,V,So many words in the doing!--
610,V,Therein you could not deceive me;
611,V,Some things are sweeter for the pursuing:
612,V,"I knew what you meant, believe me.--"
613,V,"Bunched bells of the blush pomegranate, to fix"
614,V,At your throat.... Six drops of fire they are....
615,V,Will you look--where the moon and its following star
616,V,Rise silvery over yon meadow ricks?
617,V,"While I hold--while I bend your head back, so...."
618,V,"For I know it is “yes” though you whisper “no,”"
619,V,"And my kisses, sweet, are six."

621,V,
622,VI,VI
623,VI,
624,VI,_Moths flutter around them. She speaks_:

626,VI,Look!--where the fiery
627,VI,Glow-worm in briery
628,VI,Banks of the moon-mellowed bowers
629,VI,Sparkles--how hazily
630,VI,Pinioned and airily
631,VI,"Delicate, warily,"
632,VI,"Drowsily, lazily,"
633,VI,Flutter the moths to the flowers.
634,VI,
635,VI,White as the dreamiest
636,VI,Bud of the creamiest
637,VI,"Rose in the garden that dozes,"
638,VI,See how they cling to them!
639,VI,Held in the heart of their
640,VI,"Hearts, like a part of their"
641,VI,"Perfume, they swing to them"
642,VI,Wings that are soft as a rose is.
643,VI,
644,VI,Dim as the forming of
645,VI,Dew in the warming of
646,VI,"Moonlight, they light on the petals;"
647,VI,All is revealed to them;
648,VI,All!--from the sunniest
649,VI,Tips to the honiest
650,VI,"Heart, whence they yield to them"
651,VI,"Spice, through the darkness that settles."
652,VI,
653,VI,So to our tremulous
654,VI,Souls come the emulous
655,VI,Agents of love; through whose power
656,VI,"All that is best in us,"
657,VI,"All that is beautiful,"
658,VI,"Selfless and dutiful,"
659,VI,"Is manifest in us,"
660,VI,Even as the scent of a flower.

672,VII,Is it romance or
673,VII,"Beauty of spirit,"
674,VII,"Which souls, that merit,"
675,VII,Of heaven inherit?--
676,VII,Have you an answer?
677,VII,

697,VIII,"Here in my heart it hath whispered to tell me,--"
698,VIII,They were no joys like this.
699,VIII,
700,VIII,"Were it not well if our love could forget them,"
701,VIII,Veiling the _Was_ with the dawn of the _Is_?
702,VIII,"Dead with the past we should never regret them,"
703,VIII,Being no joys like this.
704,VIII,
705,VIII,"Now they are gone and the Present stands speechful,"
706,VIII,"Ardent of word and of look and of kiss,--"
707,VIII,What though we know that their eyes are beseechful!--
708,VIII,They were no joys like this.
709,VIII,
710,VIII,"Were it not well to have more of the spirit,"
711,VIII,Living high Futures this earthly must miss?
712,VIII,"Less of the flesh, with the Past pining near it?"
713,VIII,Knowing no joys like this!

718,IX,"_Leaving the garden for the lane. He, with lightness of heart_:"
719,IX,
720,IX,"We will leave reason,"
721,IX,"Sweet, for a season:"
722,IX,Reason were treason
723,IX,Now that the nether
724,IX,"Spaces are clad, oh,"
725,IX,In silvery shadow--
726,IX,"We will be glad, oh,"

730,IX,
731,IX,"Heart unto heart! where the moonlight is slanted,"
732,IX,Let us believe that our souls are enchanted:--
733,IX,I in the castle-keep; you are the airy
734,IX,Prince who comes seeking me; love is the fairy
735,IX,Bringing us two together.
736,IX,
737,IX,_He_
738,IX,
739,IX,Starlight in masses
740,IX,Over us passes;
741,IX,And in the grass is
742,IX,Many a flower.--
743,IX,
744,IX,Now will you tell me
745,IX,How ’d you enspell me?
746,IX,What once befell me
747,IX,There in your bower?
748,IX,
749,IX,_She_
750,IX,
751,IX,"Soul unto soul!--in the moon’s wizard glory,"
752,IX,Let us believe we are parts in a story:--
753,IX,I am a poem; a poet you hear it
754,IX,"Whispered in star and in flower; a spirit,"
755,IX,"Love, puts my soul in your power."

757,IX,
758,X,X
759,X,
760,X,"_He, suddenly and very earnestly_:"
761,X,
762,X,Perhaps we lived in the days
763,X,Of the Khalif Haroun er Reshid;
764,X,"And loved, as the story says"
765,X,Did the Sultan’s favorite one
766,X,"And the Persian Emperor’s son,"
767,X,"Ali ben Bekkar, he"
768,X,Of the Kisra dynasty.
769,X,
770,X,"Do you know the story?--Well,"
771,X,_You_ were Haroun’s Sultana.
772,X,"When night on the palace fell,"
773,X,"A slave, through a secret door,--"
774,X,"Low-arched on the Tigris’ shore,--"
775,X,By a hidden winding stair
776,X,Brought me to your bower there.
777,X,
778,X,"Then there was laughter and mirth,"
779,X,"And feasting and singing together,"
780,X,In a chamber of wonderful worth;
781,X,In a chamber vaulted high
782,X,On columns of ivory;
783,X,"Its dome, like the irised skies,"
784,X,Mooned over with peacock eyes;
785,X,"Its curtains and furniture,"
786,X,Damask and juniper.
787,X,
788,X,Ten slave girls--so many blooms--
789,X,"Stand, holding tamarisk torches,"
790,X,Silk-clad from the Irak looms;
791,X,"Ten handmaidens serve the feast,"
792,X,Each maid like a star in the east;
793,X,"Ten lutanists, lutes a-tune,"
794,X,"Wait, each like the Ramadan moon."
795,X,
796,X,"For you, in a stuff of Merv"
797,X,"Blue-clad, unveiled and jeweled,"
798,X,No metaphor made may serve:
799,X,"Scarved deep with your raven hair,"
800,X,The jewels like fireflies there--
801,X,"Blossom and moon and star,"
802,X,The Lady Shemsennehar.
803,X,
804,X,The zone that girdles your waist
805,X,Would ransom a Prince and Emeer;
806,X,"In your coronet’s gold enchased,"
807,X,"And your bracelet’s twisted bar,"
808,X,Burn rubies of Istakhar;
809,X,And pearls of the Jamshid race
810,X,Hang looped on your bosom’s lace.
811,X,
812,X,You stand like the letter I;
813,X,"Dawn-faced, with eyes that sparkle"
814,X,Black stars in a rosy sky;
815,X,"Mouth, like a cloven peach,"
816,X,Sweet with your smiling speech;
817,X,"Cheeks, that the blood presumes"
818,X,To make pomegranate blooms.
819,X,
820,X,"With roses of Rocknabad,"
821,X,"Hyacinths of Bokhara,--"
822,X,Creamily cool and clad
823,X,"In gauze,--girls scatter the floor"
824,X,From pillar to cedarn door.
825,X,"Then, a pomegranate bloom in each ear,"
826,X,Come the dancing-girls of Kashmeer.
827,X,
828,X,"Kohl in their eyes, down the room,--"
829,X,That opaline casting-bottles
830,X,"Have showered with rose-perfume,--"
831,X,They glitter and drift and swoon
832,X,To the dulcimer’s languishing tune;
833,X,In the liquid light like stars
834,X,And moons and nenuphars.
835,X,
836,X,"Carbuncles, tragacanth-red,"
837,X,Smoulder in armlet and anklet:
838,X,"Gleaming on breast and on head,"
839,X,"Bangles of coins, that are angled,"
840,X,"Tinkle: and veils, that are spangled,"
841,X,Flutter from coiffure and wrist
842,X,Like a star-bewildered mist.
843,X,
844,X,Each dancing-girl is a flower
845,X,Of the Tuba from vales of El Liwa.--
846,X,How the bronzen censers glower!
847,X,"And scents of ambergris pour,"
848,X,"And of myrrh, brought out of Lahore,"
849,X,And of musk of Khoten! how good
850,X,Is the scent of the sandalwood!
851,X,
852,X,"A lutanist smites her lute,"
853,X,Sings loves of Mejnoon and Leila:--
854,X,Her voice is an Houri flute;--
855,X,"While the fragrant flambeaux wave,"
856,X,"Barbaric, o’er free and slave,"
857,X,O’er fabrics and bezels of gems
858,X,And roses in anadems.
859,X,
860,X,"Sherbets in ewers of gold,"
861,X,Fruits in salvers carnelian;
862,X,"Flagons of grotesque mold,"
863,X,"Made of a sapphire glass,"
864,X,Brimmed with wine of Shirâz;
865,X,Shaddock and melon and grape
866,X,On plate of an antique shape.
867,X,
868,X,"Vases of frosted rose,"
869,X,"Of alabaster graven,"
870,X,Filled with the mountain snows;
871,X,"Goblets of mother-of-pearl,"
872,X,One filigree silver-swirl;
873,X,Vessels of gold foamed up
874,X,With spray of spar on the cup.
875,X,
876,X,Then a slave bursts in with a cry:
877,X,“The eunuchs! the Khalif’s eunuchs!--
878,X,With scimitars bared draw nigh!
879,X,"Wesif and Afif and he,"
880,X,"Chief of the hideous three,"
881,X,Mesrour!--the Sultan ’s seen
882,X,’Mid a hundred weapons’ sheen!”
883,X,
884,X,Did we part when we heard this?--No!
885,X,It seems that my soul remembers
886,X,"How I clasped and kissed you, so...."
887,X,"When they came they found us--dead,"
888,X,On the flowers our blood dyed red;
889,X,"Our lips together, and"
890,X,The dagger in my hand.
891,X,
892,X,
893,XI,XI
894,XI,
895,XI,"_She, musingly_:"
896,XI,
897,XI,"How it was I can not tell,"
898,XI,For I know not where nor why;
899,XI,But I know we loved too well
900,XI,In some world that does not lie
901,XI,"East or west of where we dwell,"
902,XI,And beneath no earthly sky.
903,XI,
904,XI,Was it in the golden ages?--
905,XI,"Or the iron?--that I heard,--"
906,XI,"In the prophecy of sages,--"
907,XI,"Haply, how had come a bird,"
908,XI,Underneath whose wing were pages
909,XI,Of an unknown lover’s word.
910,XI,
911,XI,I forget. You may remember
912,XI,How the earthquake shook our ships;
913,XI,"How our city, one huge ember,"
914,XI,Blazed within the thick eclipse:
915,XI,When you found me--deep December
916,XI,Sealed my icy eyes and lips.
917,XI,
918,XI,I forget. No one may say
919,XI,That such things can not be true:--
920,XI,"Here a flower dies to-day,"
921,XI,"There, to-morrow, blooms anew...."
922,XI,"Death is silent.--Tell me, pray,"
923,XI,Why men doubt what God can do?

925,XI,
926,XII,XII
927,XII,
928,XII,"_He, with conviction_:"
929,XII,
930,XII,"As to that, nothing to tell!"
931,XII,"You being all my belief,"
932,XII,Doubt can not enter or dwell
933,XII,Here where your image is chief;
934,XII,"Here where your name is a spell,"
935,XII,Potent in joy and in grief.
936,XII,
937,XII,Is it the glamour of spring
938,XII,Working in us so we seem
939,XII,Aye to have loved? that we cling
940,XII,"Even to some fancy or dream,"
941,XII,"Rainbowing everything,"
942,XII,"Here in our souls, with its gleam?"
943,XII,
944,XII,See! how the synod is met
945,XII,There of the planets to preach us:--
946,XII,"Freed from the earth’s oubliette,"
947,XII,See how the blossoms beseech us!--
948,XII,Were it not well to forget
949,XII,Winter and death as they teach us?
950,XII,
951,XII,"Dew and a bud and a star,"
952,XII,"All,--like a beautiful thought,"
953,XII,Over man’s wisdom how far!--
954,XII,God for some purpose hath wrought.--
955,XII,"Could we but know why they are,"
956,XII,And that they end not in naught!
957,XII,
958,XII,Stars and the moon; and they roll
959,XII,Over our way that is white.--
960,XII,Here shall we end the long stroll?
961,XII,Here shall I kiss you good night?
962,XII,"Or, for a while, soul to soul,"
963,XII,Linger and dream of delight?
964,XII,
965,XII,
966,XIII,XIII
967,XIII,
968,XIII,_They reënter the garden. She speaks somewhat pensively_:

971,XIII,"That rose to music.--Were that power my own,"
972,XIII,"Had I that harp, that magic barbiton,"
973,XIII,What had I builded for our lives thereof?--
974,XIII,
975,XIII,"In docile shadows under bluebell skies,"
976,XIII,"A home upon the poppied edge of eve,"
977,XIII,"Beneath pale peaks the splendors never leave,"
978,XIII,’Mid lemon orchards whence the egret flies.
979,XIII,
980,XIII,"Where, pitiless, the ruined hand of death"
981,XIII,"Should never reach. No bud, no flower fade:"
982,XIII,"Where all were perfect, pure and unafraid:"
983,XIII,And life serener than an angel’s breath.
984,XIII,
985,XIII,The days should move to music: song should tame
986,XIII,"The nights, attentive with their listening stars:"
987,XIII,"And morn outrival eve in opal bars,"
988,XIII,Each preaching beauty with rose-tongues of flame.
989,XIII,
990,XIII,O home! O life! desired and to be!
991,XIII,How shall we reach you?--Far the way and dim.--
992,XIII,"Give me your hand, sweet! let us follow him,"

1033,XV,Hope’s soft voice grows thin and thinner.
1034,XV,It is kin to self-denial.
1035,XV,
1036,XV,Self-denial! Through whose feeling
1037,XV,We are gainer though we ’re loser;
1038,XV,All the finer force revealing
1039,XV,Of our natures. No accuser
1040,XV,"Is the conscience then, but healing"
1041,XV,Of the wound of which we ’re chooser.

1061,XVI,
1062,XVI,An elf there is who stables the hot
1063,XVI,Red wasp that sucks on the apricot;

1068,XVI,"Who straddles, with cap cocked, all awry,"
1069,XVI,The bottle-green back o’ the dragon-fly.
1070,XVI,
1071,XVI,And this is the elf who sips and sips
1072,XVI,From clover-horns whence the perfume drips;
1073,XVI,"And, drunk with dew, in the glimmering gloam"
1074,XVI,Awaits the wild-bee’s coming home;
1075,XVI,"In ambush lies where none may see,"
1076,XVI,And robs the caravan bumblebee:
1077,XVI,Gold bags of honey the bees must pay
1078,XVI,To the bandit elf of the fairy-way.
1079,XVI,
1080,XVI,"Another ouphen the butterflies know,"

1084,XVI,"On his bloom’s pied pallet, he paints the wings"
1085,XVI,"Of the butterflies, moths, and other things."
1086,XVI,"This is the elf that the hollyhocks hear,"
1087,XVI,Who dangles a brilliant in each one’s ear;

1089,XVI,And lights at night the glow-worm’s eye.
1090,XVI,
1091,XVI,"But the dearest elf, so the poets say,"
1092,XVI,Is the elf who hides in an eye of gray;
1093,XVI,Who curls in a dimple or slips along
1094,XVI,The strings of a lute to a lover’s song;
1095,XVI,"Who smiles in her smile and frowns in her frown,"
1096,XVI,And dreams in the scent of her glove or gown;
1097,XVI,"Hides and beckons, as all may note,"

1184,I,
1185,I,Gray skies and a foggy rain
1186,I,Dripping from streaming eaves;
1187,I,Over and over again
1188,I,Dull drop of the trickling leaves:
1189,I,"And the woodward-winding lane,"
1190,I,And the hill with its shocks of sheaves
1191,I,One scarce perceives.
1192,I,
1193,I,Shall I go in such wet weather
1194,I,By the lane or over the hill?--
1195,I,Where the blossoming milkweed’s feather

1216,I,

1221,I,And leaves of the water-beeches--
1222,I,One blister of wart-like galls--
1223,I,No rain-drop falls.

1241,II,How musky wild the lane!
1242,II,"See, how the sodden acres,"
1243,II,"Forlorn of all their rakers,"
1244,II,"Their hay and harvest makers,"
1245,II,Look green as spring again.
1246,II,
1247,II,Drops from the trumpet-flowers
1248,II,Rain on us as we pass;
1249,II,"And every zephyr showers,"
1250,II,"From tilted leaf or grass,"
1251,II,"Clear beads of moisture, seeming"
1252,II,"Pale, pointed emeralds gleaming;"

1262,II,Spill all the spice they hold.
1263,II,The west begins to glimmer;
1264,II,"And shadows, stretching slimmer,"
1265,II,Make gray the ways; and dimmer
1266,II,Grow field and forest old.
1267,II,
1268,II,Beyond those rainy reaches
1269,II,"Of woodland, far and lone,"
1270,II,A whippoorwill beseeches;
1271,II,And now an owlet’s moan
1272,II,Drifts faint upon the hearing.--
1273,II,These say the dusk is nearing.
1274,II,"And, see, the heavens, clearing,"

1276,II,

1278,II,How thin the tree-toads cry!
1279,II,Blurred in the wild-rose thicket
1280,II,Gleams wet the firefly.--
1281,II,This way toward home is nearest;
1282,II,Of weeds and briers clearest....

1294,III,That your “yes” meant “no.”
1295,III,
1296,III,Now you ’re here we ’ll have our day....
1297,III,"Let us take this daisied hollow,"
1298,III,And beneath these beeches follow
1299,III,This wild strip of way
1300,III,
1301,III,To the stream; wherein are seen
1302,III,Stealing gar and darting minnow;
1303,III,Over which snake-feeders winnow
1304,III,Wings of black and green.
1305,III,
1306,III,Like a cactus flames the sun;
1307,III,"And the mighty weaver, Even,"
1308,III,"Tenuous colored, there in heaven,"
1309,III,His rich weft ’s begun....
1310,III,
1311,III,How I love you! from the time--
1312,III,"You remember, do you not?--"
1313,III,"When, within your orchard-plot,"
1314,III,"I was reading rhyme,"
1315,III,
1316,III,As I told you. And ’t was thus:--
1317,III,"“By the blue Trinacrian sea,"
1318,III,Far in pastoral Sicily
1319,III,With Theocritus”--
1320,III,
1321,III,That I answered you who asked.
1322,III,But the curious part was this:--
1323,III,That the whole thing was amiss;
1324,III,That the Greek but masked
1325,III,
1326,III,Tales of old Boccaccio:
1327,III,Tall Decameronian maids
1328,III,"Strolled for me among the glades,"
1329,III,"Smiling, sweet and slow."
1330,III,
1331,III,"And when you approached,--my book"
1332,III,"Dropped in wonder,--seemingly"
1333,III,"To myself I said, “’Tis she!”"
1334,III,And arose to look
1335,III,
1336,III,In Lauretta’s eyes and--true!
1337,III,"Found them yours.--You shook your head,"
1338,III,"Laughing at me, as you said,"
1339,III,“Did I frighten you?”
1340,III,
1341,III,You had come for cherries; these
1342,III,Coatless then I climbed for while
1343,III,"You still questioned with a smile,"
1344,III,And still tried to tease.
1345,III,
1346,III,"Ah, love, just two years have gone"
1347,III,"Since then.... I remember, you"
1348,III,Wore a dress of billowy blue
1349,III,Muslin.--_Was_ it “lawn”?--
1350,III,
1351,III,And your apron still I see--
1352,III,All its whiteness cherry-stained--
1353,III,Which you held; wherein I rained
1354,III,Ripeness from the tree.
1355,III,
1356,III,"And I asked you--for, you know,"
1357,III,To my eyes your serious eyes
1358,III,Said such deep philosophies--
1359,III,If you ’d read Rousseau.
1360,III,
1361,III,"You remember how a chance,"
1362,III,"Somewhat like to mine, one June"
1363,III,"Happened him at castle Toune,"
1364,III,Over there in France?
1365,III,
1366,III,And a cherry dropping fair
1367,III,"On your cheek, I, envying it,"
1368,III,Cried--remembering Rousseau’s wit--
1369,III,“Would my lips were there!” ...
1370,III,
1371,III,Here we are at last. We ’ll row
1372,III,Down the stream.--The west has narrowed
1373,III,"To one streak of rose, deep-arrowed.--"
1374,III,There ’s our skiff below.

1383,IV,Fill my soul with such delight
1384,IV,As some visible music might;
1385,IV,"As some slow, majestic tune"
1386,IV,Made material to the sight.
1387,IV,
1388,IV,"Blossoms colored like the skies,"
1389,IV,"Sunset-hued and tame or wild,"
1390,IV,Fill my soul with such surmise
1391,IV,As the mind might realize
1392,IV,"If one’s thoughts, all undefiled,"
1393,IV,Should take form before the eyes.
1394,IV,
1395,IV,So to me do these appeal;
1396,IV,So they sway me every hour:
1397,IV,Letting all their beauty steal
1398,IV,On my soul to make it feel
1399,IV,"Through a rivulet or flower,"
1400,IV,More than any words reveal.

1409,V,"Or, pollen-dusty, bob and float"
1410,V,Their nenuphars around our boat.--
1411,V,The middle of the stream is reached
1412,V,Three strokes from where our boat was beached.
1413,V,
1414,V,"Look up. You scarce can see the sky,"
1415,V,"Through trees that lean, dark, dense and high;"
1416,V,"That, coiled with grape and trailing vine,"
1417,V,Build vast a roof of shade and shine;
1418,V,"A house of leaves, where shadows walk,"
1419,V,And whispering winds and waters talk.
1420,V,
1421,V,There is no path. The saplings choke
1422,V,"The trunks they spring from. There an oak,"
1423,V,"Floods from the Alleghanies bore,"
1424,V,"Lies rotting; and that sycamore,"
1425,V,"Which lays its bulk from shore to shore,--"
1426,V,"Uprooted by the rain,--perchance"
1427,V,May be the bridge to some romance:
1428,V,"Its heart of punk, a spongy white,"
1429,V,"Glows, ghostly foxfire, in the night."
1430,V,
1431,V,Now opening through a willow fringe
1432,V,"The waters creep, one tawny tinge"
1433,V,Of sunset; and on either marge
1434,V,"The cottonwoods make walls of shade,"
1435,V,"With breezy balsam pungent: large,"
1436,V,The gradual hills loom; darkly fade
1437,V,"The waters wherein herons wade,"
1438,V,"Or wing, like Faëry birds, from grass"
1439,V,That mats the shore by which we pass.

1446,V,"A vesper-sparrow flies above,"
1447,V,"Soft twittering, to its woodland love."
1448,V,A tufted-titmouse calls afar;
1449,V,"And from the west, like some swift star,"
1450,V,A glittering jay flies screaming. Slim
1451,V,The sand-snipes and kingfishers skim
1452,V,Before us; and some twilight thrush--
1453,V,Who may discover where such sing?--
1454,V,The silence rinses with a gush
1455,V,Of limpid music bubbling.
1456,V,

1461,V,"To yonder strip of ragged shore,"
1462,V,"Where, from a rock with lichens hoar,"
1463,V,"A ferny spring falls, babbling frore"
1464,V,Through woodland mosses. Gliding by
1465,V,The sulphur-colored firefly
1466,V,"Lights its pale lamp where mallows gloom,"
1467,V,And wild-bean and wild-mustard bloom.--
1468,V,Some hunter there within the woods
1469,V,"Last fall encamped, those ashes say"
1470,V,And campfire boughs.--The solitudes
1471,V,Grow dreamy with the death of day.
1472,V,
1473,V,
1474,VI,VI
1475,VI,
1476,VI,_She sings_:
1477,VI,
1478,VI,Over the fields of millet
1479,VI,A young bird tries its wings;
1480,VI,"And wild as a woodland rillet,"
1481,VI,Its first mad music rings rings--
1482,VI,"Soul of my soul, where the meadows roll"
1483,VI,What is the song it sings?
1484,VI,
1485,VI,"“Love, and a glad good-morrow,"
1486,VI,Heart where the rapture is!
1487,VI,"Good-morrow, good-morrow!"
1488,VI,Adieu to sorrow!
1489,VI,Here is the road to bliss:
1490,VI,"Where all day long you may hearken my song,"
1491,VI,"And kiss, kiss, kiss;”"
1492,VI,
1493,VI,"Over the fields of clover,"
1494,VI,"Where the wild bee drones and sways,"
1495,VI,"The wind, like a shepherd lover,"
1496,VI,Flutes on the fragrant ways--
1497,VI,"Heart of my heart, where the blossoms part,"
1498,VI,What is the air he plays?
1499,VI,
1500,VI,"“Love, and a song to follow,"
1501,VI,Soul with the face a-gleam!
1502,VI,"Come follow, come follow,"
1503,VI,"O’er hill and through hollow,"
1504,VI,To the land o’ the bloom and beam:
1505,VI,"Where, under the flowers, you may listen for hours,"
1506,VI,"And dream, dream, dream!”"

1509,VII,VII
1510,VII,
1511,VII,"_He speaks, letting the boat drift_:"
1512,VII,
1513,VII,Here the shores are irised; grasses
1514,VII,"Clump the water gray, that glasses"
1515,VII,Broken wood and deepened distance.
1516,VII,Far the musical persistence
1517,VII,Of a field-lark lingers low
1518,VII,In the west’s rich tulip-glow.
1519,VII,
1520,VII,White before us flames one pointed
1521,VII,Star; and Day hath Night anointed
1522,VII,King; from out her azure ewer
1523,VII,"Pouring starry fire, truer"
1524,VII,Than pure gold. Star-crowned he stands
1525,VII,With the starlight in his hands.
1526,VII,
1527,VII,Will the moon bleach through the ragged
1528,VII,Tree-tops ere we reach yon jagged
1529,VII,"Rock that rises gradually,"
1530,VII,Pharos of our homeward valley?--
1531,VII,All the west is smouldering red;
1532,VII,Embers are the stars o’erhead.
1533,VII,
1534,VII,At my soul some Protean elf is:
1535,VII,"You ’re Simætha; I am Delphis,"
1536,VII,"You are Sappho and your Phaon,"
1537,VII,"I.--We love.--There lies our way, on,--"
1538,VII,"Let us say,--Æolian seas,"
1539,VII,To the violet Lesbian leas.
1540,VII,
1541,VII,On we drift. I love you. Nearer
1542,VII,"Looms our Island. Rosier, clearer,"
1543,VII,"The Leucadian cliff we follow,"
1544,VII,Where the temple of Apollo
1545,VII,Shines--a pale and pillared fire....
1546,VII,"Strike, oh, strike the Lydian lyre!--"
1547,VII,Out of Hellas blows the breeze
1548,VII,Singing to the Sapphic seas.

1552,VIII,
1553,VIII,"_Landing, he sings_:"
1554,VIII,
1555,VIII,"Night, night, ’t is night. The moon drifts low above us,"
1556,VIII,And all its gold is tangled in the stream:
1557,VIII,"Love, love, my love, and all the stars, that love us,"
1558,VIII,The stars smile down and every star ’s a dream.
1559,VIII,
1560,VIII,"In odorous purple, where the falling warble"
1561,VIII,"Of water cascades and the plunged foam glows,"
1562,VIII,A columned ruin lifts its sculptured marble
1563,VIII,Friezed with the chiselled rebeck and the rose.
1564,VIII,
1565,VIII,
1566,VIII,_She sings_:
1567,VIII,
1568,VIII,"Sleep, sleep, sweet sleep sleeps at the drifting tiller,"
1569,VIII,And in our sail the Spirit of the Rain--
1570,VIII,"Love, love, my love, ah, bid thy heart be stiller,"
1571,VIII,"And, hark! the music of the singing main."
1572,VIII,
1573,VIII,"What flowers are those that blow their balm unto us,"
1574,VIII,"From mouths of wild aroma, each a flame?--"
1575,VIII,"Or is it Love that breathes? sweet Love who drew us,"
1576,VIII,Who kissed our eyes and made us see the same?
1577,VIII,
1578,VIII,
1579,VIII,_He speaks_:
1580,VIII,
1581,VIII,Dreams; dreams we dream! no dream that we would banish!
1582,VIII,The temple and the nightingale _are_ there!
1583,VIII,"Our love hath made them, nevermore to vanish,"
1584,VIII,"Real as yon moon, this wild-rose in your hair."
1585,VIII,
1586,VIII,"Night, night, ’tis night!--and Love’s own star ’s before us,"
1587,VIII,Its starred reflection in the starry stream.--
1588,VIII,"Yes, yes, ah yes! his presence shall watch o’er us,"
1589,VIII,"To-night, to-night, and every night we dream."

1594,IX,_Homeward through flowers; she speaks_:
1595,IX,
1596,IX,Behold the offerings of the common hills!
1597,IX,Whose lowly names have made them three times dear:
1598,IX,One evening-primrose and an apron-full
1599,IX,"Of violets; and there, in multitudes,"
1600,IX,"Dim-seen in moonlight, sweet cerulean wan,"
1601,IX,"The bluet, making heaven of every dell"
1602,IX,With morn’s ambrosial blue: dew-dropping plumes
1603,IX,Of the mauve beard’s-tongue; and the red-freaked cups
1604,IX,"Of blackberry-lilies all along the creek,"
1605,IX,"Where, lulled, the freckled silence sleeps, and vague"
1606,IX,"The water flows, when, at high noon, the cows"
1607,IX,"Wade knee-deep, and the heat is honied with"
1608,IX,The drone of drowsy bees and dizzy flies.
1609,IX,How bright the moon is on that fleur-de-lis;
1610,IX,"Blue, streaked with crystal like a summer day:"
1611,IX,And is it moonlight there? or is it flowers?
1612,IX,White violets? lilies? or a daisy bed?
1613,IX,"And now the wind, with softest lullaby,"
1614,IX,Swings all their cradled heads and rocks-to-sleep
1615,IX,"Their fragrant faces and their golden eyes,"
1616,IX,"Curtained, and frailly wimpled with the dew."
1617,IX,
1618,IX,Simple suggestions of a life most fair!
1619,IX,"Flowers, you speak of love and untaught faith,"
1620,IX,"Whose habitation is within the soul,"
1621,IX,"Not of the Earth, yet for the Earth indeed...."
1622,IX,
1623,IX,"What is it halcyons my heart? makes calm,"
1624,IX,"With calmness not of knowledge, all my soul"
1625,IX,This night of nights?--Is ’t love? or faith? or both?--
1626,IX,The lore of all the world is less than these
1627,IX,"Simple suggestions of a life most fair,"
1628,IX,And love most sweet that I have learned to know!

1633,X,"_He speaks, musingly_:"
1634,X,
1635,X,"Yes, I have known its being so;"
1636,X,Long ago was I seeing so--
1637,X,"Beckoning on to a fairer land,"
1638,X,Out of the flowers it waved its hand;
1639,X,"Bidding me on to life and love,"
1640,X,Life with the hope of the love thereof.
1641,X,
1642,X,"What is the value of knowing it,"
1643,X,If you are shy in showing it?--
1644,X,"Need of the earth unfolds the flower,"
1645,X,"Dewy sweet, at the proper hour;"
1646,X,"And, in the world of the human heart,"
1647,X,Love is the flower’s counterpart.
1648,X,
1649,X,"So when the soul is heedable,"
1650,X,Then is the heart made readable.--
1651,X,I in the book of your heart have read
1652,X,Words that are truer than truth hath said:
1653,X,"Measures of love, the spirit’s song,"
1654,X,Writ of your soul to haunt me long.
1655,X,
1656,X,Love can hear each laudable
1657,X,"Thought of the loved made audible,"
1658,X,"Spoken in wonder, or joy, or pain,"
1659,X,And reëcho it back again:
1660,X,"Ever responsive, ever awake,"
1661,X,Ever replying with ache for ache.

1670,XI,"_These_ are as lips that woo us,"
1671,XI,"_Those_ are as lights that lead,"
1672,XI,"With love that doth pursue us,"
1673,XI,With hope that still doth speed.
1674,XI,
1675,XI,"Yet shall the flowers lie riven,"
1676,XI,And lips forget to kiss;
1677,XI,"The stars fade out of heaven,"
1678,XI,And lights lead us amiss--
1679,XI,As love for which we ’ve striven;

1686,XII,
1687,XII,"If love I have had of you, you had of me,"
1688,XII,Then doubtless our loving were over;
1689,XII,"One would be less than the other, you see;"
1690,XII,Since what you returned to your lover
1691,XII,Were only his own; and--
1692,XII,

1694,XIII,XIII
1695,XIII,
1696,XIII,"_She interrupts him, speaking impetuously_:"
1697,XIII,
1698,XIII,"But if I lose you, if you part with me,"
1699,XIII,I will not love you less
1700,XIII,Loving so much now. If there is to be
1701,XIII,"A parting and distress,--"
1702,XIII,What will avail to comfort or relieve
1703,XIII,The soul that’s anguished most?--
1704,XIII,"The knowledge that it once possessed, perceive,"
1705,XIII,The love that it has lost.
1706,XIII,"You must acknowledge, under sun and moon"
1707,XIII,All that we feel is old;
1708,XIII,Let morning flutter from night’s brown cocoon
1709,XIII,Wide wings of flaxen gold;
1710,XIII,"The moon burst through the darkness, soaring o’er,"
1711,XIII,"Like some great moth and white,"
1712,XIII,These have been seen a myriad times before
1713,XIII,And with renewed delight.--
1714,XIII,So ’tis with love;--how old yet new it is!--
1715,XIII,"This only should we heed,--"
1716,XIII,"To once have known, to once have felt love’s bliss,"
1717,XIII,Is to be rich indeed.--
1718,XIII,"Whether we win or lose, we lose or win,"
1719,XIII,Within our gain or loss
1720,XIII,"Some purpose lies, some end unseen of sin,"
1721,XIII,Beyond our crown or cross.

1727,XIV,
1728,XIV,"True, true!--Perhaps it would be best"
1729,XIV,To be that lone star in the west;
1730,XIV,"Above the earth, within the skies,"
1731,XIV,Yet shining here in your blue eyes.
1732,XIV,
1733,XIV,"Or, haply, better here to blow"
1734,XIV,A flower beneath your window low;
1735,XIV,"That, brief of life and frail and fair,"
1736,XIV,Finds yet a heaven in your hair.
1737,XIV,
1738,XIV,"Or well, perhaps, to be the breeze"
1739,XIV,That sighs its soul out to the trees;
1740,XIV,"A voice, a breath of rain or drouth,"
1741,XIV,That has its wild will with your mouth.
1742,XIV,
1743,XIV,These things I long to be. I long
1744,XIV,To be the burthen of some song
1745,XIV,"You love to sing; a melody,"

1753,XV,Sunday shall we ride together?
1754,XV,"Not the root-rough, rambling way"
1755,XV,"Through the wood we went that day,"
1756,XV,In last summer’s sultry weather.
1757,XV,
1758,XV,"Past the Methodist camp-meeting,"
1759,XV,Where religion helped the hymn
1760,XV,Gather volume; and a slim
1761,XV,"Minister, with textful greeting,"
1762,XV,
1763,XV,Welcomed us and still expounded.--
1764,XV,From the service on the hill
1765,XV,We had passed three hills and still
1766,XV,"Loud, though far, the singing sounded."
1767,XV,
1768,XV,Nor that road through weed and berry
1769,XV,Drowsy days led me and you
1770,XV,"To the old-time barbecue,"
1771,XV,Where the country-side made merry.
1772,XV,
1773,XV,Dusty vehicles together;
1774,XV,Darkies with the horses near
1775,XV,Tied to trees; the atmosphere
1776,XV,"Redolent of bark and leather,"
1777,XV,
1778,XV,And of burgoo and of beef; there
1779,XV,Roasting whole within the trench;
1780,XV,Near which spread the long pine bench
1781,XV,Under shading limb and leaf there.
1782,XV,
1783,XV,As we went the homeward journey
1784,XV,"You exclaimed, “They intermix"
1785,XV,"Pleasure there and politics,"
1786,XV,Love and war: our modern tourney.”
1787,XV,
1788,XV,"And the fiddles!--through the thickets,"
1789,XV,How they thumped the old quadrille!
1790,XV,"Scraping, droning on the hill,"
1791,XV,It was like a swarm of crickets....
1792,XV,
1793,XV,Neither road! The shady quiet
1794,XV,"Of that path by beech and birch,"
1795,XV,Winding to the ruined church
1796,XV,Near the stream that sparkles by it.
1797,XV,
1798,XV,Where the silent Sundays listen
1799,XV,For the preacher--Love--we bring
1800,XV,In our hearts to preach and sing
1801,XV,Week-day shade to Sabbath glisten.

1810,XVI,"Portals that the stars adorn,--"
1811,XVI,Whence Light’s golden presence throws his
1812,XVI,"Flaming lilies, burning roses,"
1813,XVI,"At the wide wood’s world of wall,"
1814,XVI,Spears of sparkle at each fall:
1815,XVI,
1816,XVI,Then together we will ride
1817,XVI,To the wood’s cathedral places;
1818,XVI,"Where, like prayers, the wildflowers hide,"
1819,XVI,Sabbath in their fairy faces;
1820,XVI,"Where, in truest, untaught phrases,"
1821,XVI,"Worship in each rhythmic word,"
1822,XVI,God is praised by many a bird.
1823,XVI,
1824,XVI,"Look above you.--Pearly white,"
1825,XVI,Star on star now crystallizes
1826,XVI,Out of darkness: Afric night

1844,XVII,"Yes, my sweet, O my sweet,"

1846,XVII,To walk together in starry weather
1847,XVII,Down lanes with elder smelling.
1848,XVII,
1849,XVII,"O my heart, yes, my heart,"
1850,XVII,Now is the time for saying!

1885,I,Now Time grants night the more and day the less:
1886,I,"The gray decides; and brown,"

1904,I,Above the grass the spendthrift spider weaves
1905,I,A web of silver for which dawn designs
1906,I,"Thrice twenty rows of pearls: beneath the oak,"
1907,I,"That rolls old roots in many gnarly lines,--"
1908,I,"The polished acorns, from their saucers broke,"

1912,I,"Of burning brush, beyond that field of hay,"
1913,I,Hangs like a pillar in the atmosphere;
1914,I,But now it shakes--it breaks and all the
1915,I,vines And tree-tops tremble;--see! the wind is here!
1916,I,Billowing and boisterous; and the smiling day
1917,I,Rejoices in its clamor. Earth and sky
1918,I,"Resound with glory of its majesty,"
1919,I,Impetuous splendor of its rushing by.--
1920,I,"But on those heights the forest still is still,"
1921,I,Expectant of its coming.... Far away
1922,I,Each anxious tree upon each waiting hill
1923,I,"Tingles anticipation, as in gray"
1924,I,"Surmise of rapture. Now the first gusts play,"
1925,I,"Like laughter low, about their rippling spines;"

1927,I,"Shouts--and the light at each tumultuous pause,"
1928,I,"The light that glooms and shines,"
1929,I,Seems hands in wild applause.
1930,I,
1931,I,How glows that garden! though the white mists keep
1932,I,The vagabonding flowers reminded of
1933,I,"Decay that comes to slay in open love,"
1934,I,When the full moon hangs cold and night is deep;
1935,I,"Unheeding still, their cardinal colors leap"
1936,I,"And laugh encircled of the scythe of death,--"
1937,I,"Like lovely children he prepares to reap,--"
1938,I,Staying his blade a breath
1939,I,"To mark their beauty ere, with one last sweep,"

1941,I,"Let me admire,--"
1942,I,Before the sickle of the coming cold

1944,I,How like to spurts of fire

1946,I,"Yon square of sunlight. And, as sparkles creep"
1947,I,"Through charring parchment, up that window’s screen"

1958,I,"And elfed in petals. The nasturtium,"
1959,I,"All pungent leaved and acrid of perfume,"
1960,I,"Hangs up its goblin bonnet, fairy-brought"
1961,I,"From Gnomeland. There, predominant red,"
1962,I,"And arrogant, the dahlia lifts its head,"
1963,I,"Beside the balsam’s rose-stained horns of honey,"
1964,I,"Deep in the murmuring, sunny,"
1965,I,Dry wildness of the weedy flower-bed;
1966,I,"Where crickets and the weed-bugs, noon and night,"
1967,I,"Shrill dirges for the flowers that soon will die,"
1968,I,And flowers already dead.--

1971,I,"“Too soon, too soon the Beautiful passes by!"
1972,I,"And soon, amid her bowers,"
1973,I,Will dripping Autumn mourn with all her flowers.”--
1974,I,"If I, perchance, might peep"

1976,I,"That the bland wind with odorous whispers rocks,"
1977,I,"I might behold her,--white"
1978,I,"And weary,--Summer, ’mid her flowers asleep,"

1990,II,Up hills of bough and brier.
1991,II,This hooked thorn caught her gown and seemed
1992,II,Imploring her to linger;
1993,II,Upon her hair a sun-ray streamed
1994,II,Like some baptizing finger.
1995,II,
1996,II,"This false-foxglove, so golden now"

2000,II,Was like an Indian’s painted face;
2001,II,"And, like a squaw, attended"
2002,II,"That bush, in vague vermilion grace,"
2003,II,With beads of berries splendid.
2004,II,
2005,II,"And here we turned to mount that hill,"
2006,II,Down which the wild brook tumbles;
2007,II,"And, like to-day, that day was still,"
2008,II,And mild winds swayed the umbels
2009,II,"Of these wild-carrots, lawny gray:"
2010,II,"And there, deep-dappled o’er us,"
2011,II,An orchard stretched; and in our way
2012,II,Dropped ripened fruit before us.
2013,II,
2014,II,"With muffled thud the pippin fell,"
2015,II,And at our feet rolled dusty;
2016,II,"A hornet clinging to its bell,"
2017,II,The pear lay bruised and rusty:
2018,II,"The smell of pulpy peach and plum,"
2019,II,"From which the juice oozed yellow,--"
2020,II,"Around which bees made sleepy hum,--"
2021,II,Made warm the air and mellow.
2022,II,
2023,II,"And then we came where, many-hued,"
2024,II,The wet wild morning-glory
2025,II,Hung its balloons in shadows dewed
2026,II,For dawning’s offertory:
2027,II,"With bush and bramble, far away,"
2028,II,"Beneath us stretched the valley,"
2029,II,"Cleft of one creek, as clear as day,"
2030,II,That rippled musically.
2031,II,
2032,II,"The brown, the bronze, the green, the red"
2033,II,Of weed and brier ran riot
2034,II,"To walls of woods, whose pathways led"
2035,II,To nooks of whispering quiet:
2036,II,Long waves of feathering goldenrod
2037,II,"Ran through the gray in patches,"
2038,II,As in a cloud the gold of God
2039,II,"Burns, that the sunset catches."
2040,II,
2041,II,"And there, above the blue hills rolled,"
2042,II,"Like some far conflagration,"
2043,II,"The sunset, flaming marigold,"
2044,II,We watched in exultation:
2045,II,"Then, turning homeward, she and I"
2046,II,Went in love’s sweet derangement--
2047,II,"How different now seem earth and sky,"
2048,II,Since this undreamed estrangement.

2057,III,Some might find sympathy
2058,III,"For loss, or grief the grimmest,"
2059,III,In each great-hearted tree--
2060,III,Here where the day is dimmest--
2061,III,"But, ah, there ’s none for me!"
2062,III,
2063,III,"In leaves might find communion,"
2064,III,"Returning sigh for sigh,"
2065,III,For love the heavens deny;
2066,III,"The love that yearns for union,"

2087,IV,When near us the solace lies?
2088,IV,"There, in that stream, that, deep,--"
2089,IV,"Reflecting woods and skies,--"

2105,V,O vales and hills! O valley-lands and knobs!
2106,V,What cure have you for woe?
2107,V,What balm that robs
2108,V,"The brain of thought, the knowledge of its woe?"
2109,V,None! none! ah me! that my sick heart may know!--
2110,V,The wearying sameness!--yet this thing is so!
2111,V,"This thing is so, and still the waters flow,"
2112,V,The leaves drop slowly down; the daylight throbs
2113,V,"With sun and wind, and yet this thing is so!"
2114,V,There is no sympathy in heaven or earth
2115,V,"For human sorrow! all we see is mirth,"
2116,V,Or madness; cruelty or lust;
2117,V,Nature is heedless of her children’s grief;
2118,V,"Man is to her no more than is a leaf,"
2119,V,"That buds and has its summer, that is brief,"
2120,V,"Then falls, and mixes with the common dust."
2121,V,"Here, at this culvert’s mouth,"
2122,V,"The shadowy water, flowing toward the south,"
2123,V,"Seems deepest, stagnant-stayed.--"
2124,V,What is it yonder that makes me afraid?
2125,V,Of my own self afraid?--I do not know!--
2126,V,What power draws me to the striate stream?
2127,V,What evil? or what dream?
2128,V,"Me! dropping pebbles in the quiet wave,"
2129,V,"That echoes, strange as music in a cave,"
2130,V,"Hollow and thin; vibrating in the shade,"
2131,V,"As if ’t were tears that fell, and, falling, made"
2132,V,"A crystal sound, a shadow wail of woe,"
2133,V,Wrung from the rocks and waters there below;
2134,V,An ailing phantom that will not be laid;
2135,V,"Complaining ghosts of sobs that fill my breast,--"
2136,V,"That will not forth,--and give my heart no rest."
2137,V,
2138,V,"There, in the water, how the lank sword-grass"
2139,V,"Mats its long blades, each blade a crooked kris,"
2140,V,Making a marsh; ’mid which the currents miss
2141,V,Their rock-born melodies.
2142,V,"But there and there, one sees"
2143,V,"The wide-belled mallow, as within a glass,"
2144,V,"Long-pistiled, leaning o’er"
2145,V,"The root-contorted shore,"
2146,V,As if its own pink image it would kiss.
2147,V,And there the tangled wild-potato vine
2148,V,"Lifts beakered blossoms, each a cup of wine,"
2149,V,As pale as moonlight is:--
2150,V,"No mandrake, curling convolutions up,"
2151,V,"Loops heavier blossoms, each a conical cup"
2152,V,That swoons moon-nectar and a serpent’s hiss.--
2153,V,"And there tall gipsy lilies, all a-sway,"
2154,V,Of coppery hue
2155,V,"Streaked as with crimson dew,"
2156,V,"Mirror fierce faces in the deeps,"
2157,V,"O’er which they lean, bent in inverted view.--"
2158,V,"And where the stream around those rushes creeps,"
2159,V,"The dragon-fly, in endless error, keeps"
2160,V,Sewing the pale-gold gown of day
2161,V,With tangled stitches of a burning blue:
2162,V,"Its brilliant body is a needle fine,"
2163,V,"A thread of azure ray,"
2164,V,"Black-pinioned, shuttling the shade and shine."
2165,V,But here before me where my pensive shade
2166,V,"Looks up at me, the stale stream, stagnant, lies,"
2167,V,"Deep, dark, but clear and silent; streaked with hues"
2168,V,"Of ragweed pollen, and of spawny ooze,"
2169,V,"Through which the seeping bubbles, bursting, rise.--"
2170,V,All flowers here refuse
2171,V,"To grow or blossom; beauties, too, are few,"
2172,V,That haunt its depths: no glittering minnows braid
2173,V,Its sleepy crystal; and no gravels strew
2174,V,With colored orbs its bottom. Half afraid
2175,V,I shrink from my own eyes
2176,V,There in its cairngorm of reflected skies.--
2177,V,"I know not why, and yet it seems I see--"
2178,V,What is ’t I see there moving stealthily?
2179,V,
2180,V,"I know not what!--But where the kildees wade,"
2181,V,"Slim in the foamy scum,"
2182,V,"From that direction hither doth it come,"
2183,V,"Whate’er it is, that makes my soul afraid."
2184,V,"Nearer it draws to where those low rocks ail,"
2185,V,"Warm rocks, on which some water-snake hath clomb,"
2186,V,"Basking its spotted body, coiling numb,"
2187,V,Brown in the brindled shade.--
2188,V,"At first it seemed a prism on the grail,"
2189,V,"A bubble’s prism, like the shadow made"
2190,V,"Of water-striders; then a trail,"
2191,V,An angled sparkle in a webby veil
2192,V,"Of duckweed, green as verdigris, it swayed"
2193,V,"Frog-like through deeps, to crouch, a flaccid, pale,"
2194,V,Squat bulk below....
2195,V,"I gaze, and though I would, I can not go."
2196,V,"Reflected trees and skies,"
2197,V,"And breeze-blown clouds that lounge at sunny loss,"
2198,V,"Seem in its stolid eyes,"
2199,V,"Its fishy gaze, that holds me in strange wise."
2200,V,"Ghoul-like it seems to rise,"
2201,V,"And now to sink; its eldritch features fail,"
2202,V,"Then come again in rhythmic waviness,"
2203,V,With arms like tentacles that seem to press
2204,V,"Thro’ weed and water: limbs that writhe and fade,"
2205,V,"And clench, and twist, and toss,"
2206,V,"Root-like and gnarled, and cross and inter-cross"
2207,V,Through flabby hair of smoky moss.
2208,V,
2209,V,How horrible to see this thing at night!
2210,V,Or when the sunset slants its brimstone light
2211,V,"Above the pool! when, blue, in phantom flight,"
2212,V,"The will-o’-the-wisps, perhaps, above it reel."
2213,V,"Then, haply, would it rise, a rotting green,"
2214,V,"Up, up, and gather me with arms of steel,"
2215,V,"Soft steel, and drag me where the wave is white,"
2216,V,"Beneath that boulder brown, that plants a keel"
2217,V,"Against the ripple there, a shoulder lean.--"
2218,V,"No, no! I must away before ’tis night!"
2219,V,Before the fireflies dot
2220,V,The dark with sulphur blurrings bright!
2221,V,"Before, upon that height,"
2222,V,The white wild-carrots vanish from the sight;
2223,V,"And boneset blossoms, tossing there in clusters,"
2224,V,"Fade to a ridge, a streak of ghostly lustres:"
2225,V,"And, in that sunlit spot,"
2226,V,Yon cedar tree is not!
2227,V,"But a huge cap instead, that, half-asleep,"
2228,V,Some giant dropped while driving home his sheep:
2229,V,And ’mid those fallow browns
2230,V,"And russet grays, the fragrant peak"
2231,V,"Of yonder timothy stack,"
2232,V,"Is not a stack, but something hideous, black,"
2233,V,"That threatens and, grotesquely demon, frowns."
2234,V,
2235,V,I must away from here.--
2236,V,Already dusk draws near.
2237,V,The owlet’s dolorous hoot
2238,V,Sounds quavering as a gnome’s wild flute;
2239,V,"The toad, within the wet,"
2240,V,Begins to tune its goblin flageolet:
2241,V,The slow sun sinks behind
2242,V,"Those hills; and, like a withered cheek"
2243,V,"Of Quaker quiet, sorrow-burdened, there"
2244,V,The spectral moon ’s defined
2245,V,"Above those trees,--as in a wild-beast’s lair"
2246,V,"A golden woman, dead, with golden hair,--"
2247,V,Above that mass of fox-grape vines
2248,V,"That, like a wrecked appentice, roofs those pines.--"
2249,V,"Oh, I am faint and weak.--"
2250,V,"I must away, away!"
2251,V,Before the close of day!--
2252,V,Already at my back
2253,V,I feel the woods grow black;
2254,V,"And sense the evening wind,"
2255,V,"Guttural and gaunt and blind,"
2256,V,Whining behind me like an unseen wolf.
2257,V,Deeper now seems the gulf
2258,V,Into whose deeps I gaze;
2259,V,"From which, with madness and amaze,"
2260,V,"_That_ seems to rise, the horror there,"
2261,V,With webby hands and mossy eyes and hair.--
2262,V,"Oh, will it pierce,"
2263,V,"With all its feelers fierce,"
2264,V,Beyond the pool’s unhallowed water-streak?--
2265,V,
2266,V,"Yes; I must go, must go!"
2267,V,"Must leave this ghastly creek,"
2268,V,This place of hideous fear!
2269,V,For everywhere I hear
2270,V,"A dripping footstep near,"
2271,V,"A voice, like water, gurgling at my ear,"
2272,V,"Saying, “Come to me! come and rest below!"
2273,V,Sleep and forget her and with her thy woe!”--
2274,V,"I try to fly.--I can not.--Yes, and no!--"
2275,V,"What madness holds me!--God! that obscene, slow,"
2276,V,"Sure mastering chimera there,"
2277,V,"Perhaps, has fastened round my neck,"
2278,V,"Or in my matted hair,"
2279,V,"Some horrible feeler, dire, invisible!--"
2280,V,"Off, off! thou hoop of Hell!"
2281,V,Thou devil’s coil!...
2282,V,"Back, back into thy cesspool! Off of me!--"
2283,V,"See, how the waters thrash and boil!"
2284,V,At last! at last! thank God! my soul is free!
2285,V,My mind is freed of that vile mesmerism
2286,V,That drew me to--what end? my God! what end?
2287,V,"Haply ’twas merely fancy, that strange fiend:"
2288,V,"My fancy, and a prism"
2289,V,"Of sunset in the stream, a firefly fleck,"
2290,V,"That now, a lamp of golden fairy oil,"
2291,V,"Lights me my homeward way, the way I flee."
2292,V,"No more I stare, magnetic-fixed; nor reck,"
2293,V,Nor little care to foil
2294,V,The madness there! the murder there! that slips
2295,V,"Back to its lair of slime, that seeps and drips,"
2296,V,That sought in vain to fasten on my lips.

2301,VI,"_Taking a letter from his pocket, he hurries away_:"
2302,VI,
2303,VI,What can it mean for me? what have I done to her?
2304,VI,"I, in our season of love as a sun to her:"
2305,VI,"She, all my heaven of silvery, numberless"
2306,VI,"Stars and its moon, shining golden and slumberless;"
2307,VI,"Who on my life, that was thorny and lowery,"
2308,VI,Came--and made beautiful; smiled--and made flowery.
2309,VI,"She, to my heart and my soul a divinity!"
2310,VI,"She, who--I dreamed!--seemed my spirit-affinity!--"
2311,VI,What have I done to her? what have I done?
2312,VI,
2313,VI,What can she mean by this?--what have I said to her?
2314,VI,"I, who have idolized, worshiped, and pled to her;"
2315,VI,"Sung with her, laughed with her, sorrowed and sighed for her;"
2316,VI,Lived for her only; and gladly had died for her!
2317,VI,See! she has written me thus! she has written me--
2318,VI,Sooner would dagger or serpent had smitten me!--
2319,VI,"Would you had shriveled ere ever you’d read of it,"
2320,VI,"Eyes, that are wide to the grief and the dread of it!--"
2321,VI,What have I said to her? what have I said?
2322,VI,"What shall I make of it? I who am trembling,"
2323,VI,"Fearful of losing.--A moth, the dissembling"
2324,VI,"Flame of a taper attracts with its guttering,"
2325,VI,"Flattering on till its body lies fluttering,"
2326,VI,"Scorched in the summer night.--Foolish, importunate,"
2327,VI,"Why didst thou quit the cool flowers, unfortunate!--"
2328,VI,"Such has she been to me, making me such to her!--"
2329,VI,"Slaying me, saying I never was much to her!--"
2330,VI,What shall I make of it? what can I make?
2331,VI,
2332,VI,"Love, in thy everglades, moaning and motionless,"
2333,VI,"Look, I have fallen; the evil is potionless:"
2334,VI,"I, with no thought but the day that did lock us in,"
2335,VI,"Set naked feet ’mid the cottonmouth-moccasin,"
2336,VI,"Under the roses, the Cherokee, eying me:--"
2337,VI,"I,--in the heav’n with the egrets that, flying me,"
2338,VI,"Winging like blooms from magnolias, rose slenderly,"
2339,VI,Pearl and pale pink: where the mocking-bird tenderly
2340,VI,"Sang, making vistas of mosses melodious,"
2341,VI,"Wandered,--unheeding my steps,--in the odious"
2342,VI,Ooze and the venom. I followed the wiry
2343,VI,Violet curve of thy star falling fiery--
2344,VI,So was I lost in night! thus am undone!
2345,VI,
2346,VI,Have I not told to her--living alone for her--
2347,VI,Purposed unfoldments of deeds I had sown for her
2348,VI,Here in the soil of my soul? their variety
2349,VI,Endless--and ever she answered with piety.
2350,VI,See! it has come to this--all the tale’s suavity
2351,VI,At the ninth chapter grows hateful with gravity;
2352,VI,Cruel as death all our beautiful history--
2353,VI,Close it!--the final is more than a mystery.--
2354,VI,Yes; I will go to her; yes; and will speak.
2355,VI,
2356,VI,
2357,VII,VII
2358,VII,
2359,VII,_After the final meeting; the day following_:
2360,VII,
2361,VII,I seem to see her still; to see
2362,VII,That blue-hung room. Her perfume comes
2363,VII,"From lavender folds, draped dreamily,--"
2364,VII,"A-blossom with brocaded blooms,--"
2365,VII,Some stuff of orient looms.
2366,VII,
2367,VII,"I seem to hear her speak; and back,"
2368,VII,Where sleeps the sun on books and piles
2369,VII,"Of porcelain and bric-à-brac,"
2370,VII,"A tall clock ticks above the tiles,"
2371,VII,Where Love’s framed profile smiles.
2372,VII,
2373,VII,"I hear her say, “Ah, had I known!--"
2374,VII,I suffer too for what has been--
2375,VII,For what must be.”--A wild ache shone
2376,VII,In her sad gaze that seemed to lean
2377,VII,"On something far, unseen."
2378,VII,
2379,VII,And as in sleep my own self seems
2380,VII,Outside my suffering self.--I flush
2381,VII,"’Twixt facts and undetermined dreams,"
2382,VII,"And stand, as silent as that hush"
2383,VII,Of lilac light and plush.
2384,VII,
2385,VII,"Smiling, but suffering, I feel,"
2386,VII,"Beneath that face, so sweet and sad,"
2387,VII,"In those pale temples, thoughts, like steel,"
2388,VII,Pierce burningly.... I had gone mad
2389,VII,Had I once thought her glad.--
2390,VII,
2391,VII,"Unconsciously, with eyes that yearn"
2392,VII,"To look beyond the present far,"
2393,VII,"For one faint future hope, I turn--"
2394,VII,"There, in her garden, one fierce star,"
2395,VII,"A cactus, red as war,"
2396,VII,
2397,VII,"Vermilion as a storm-sunk sun,"
2398,VII,"Flames torrid splendor,--brings to life"
2399,VII,A sunset; memory of one
2400,VII,Rich eve she said she ’d be my wife;
2401,VII,An eve with beauty rife.
2402,VII,
2403,VII,"Again amid the heavy hues,"
2404,VII,"Soft crimson, seal, and satiny gold"
2405,VII,"Of flowers there, I stood ’mid dews"
2406,VII,"With her; deep in her garden old,"
2407,VII,While sunset’s flame unrolled.
2408,VII,
2409,VII,And now!... It can not be! and yet
2410,VII,To see ’tis so!--In heart and brain
2411,VII,"To know ’tis so!--While, warm and wet,"
2412,VII,"I seem to smell those scents again,"
2413,VII,Verbena scents and rain.
2414,VII,
2415,VII,"I turn, in hope she ’ll bid me stay."
2416,VII,Again her cameo beauty mark
2417,VII,Set in that smile.--She turns away.
2418,VII,No farewell! no regret! no spark
2419,VII,Of hope to cheer the dark!
2420,VII,
2421,VII,That sepia sketch--conceive it so--
2422,VII,A jaunty head with mouth and eyes
2423,VII,"Tragic beneath a rose-chapeau,"
2424,VII,"Silk-masked, unmasking--it denies"
2425,VII,"The look we half surmise,"
2426,VII,
2427,VII,We know is there. ’Tis thus we read
2428,VII,The true beneath the false; perceive
2429,VII,The ache beneath the smile.--Indeed!
2430,VII,"Whose soul unmasks?... Not mine!--I grieve,--"
2431,VII,Oh God!--but laugh and leave....

2436,VIII,_He walks aimlessly on_:
2437,VIII,
2438,VIII,"Beyond those knotted apple-trees,"
2439,VIII,"That partly hide the old brick barn,"
2440,VIII,Its tattered arms and tattered knees
2441,VIII,A scarecrow tosses to the breeze
2442,VIII,Among the shocks of corn.
2443,VIII,
2444,VIII,"My heart is gray as is the day,"
2445,VIII,In which the rain-wind drearily

2447,VIII,"And in the hollows, by each way,"
2448,VIII,The dead leaves rustle wearily.
2449,VIII,
2450,VIII,And soon we ’ll hear the far wild-geese
2451,VIII,Honk in frost-bitten heavens under
2452,VIII,"Arcturus; when my walks must cease,"
2453,VIII,And by the fireside’s log-heaped peace
2454,VIII,I ’ll sit and nod and ponder.--
2455,VIII,
2456,VIII,When every fall of this loud creek
2457,VIII,Is silent with the frost; and tented
2458,VIII,Brown acres of the corn stretch bleak
2459,VIII,"And shaggy with the snows, that streak"
2460,VIII,"The hillsides, hollow-dented;"
2461,VIII,
2462,VIII,I ’ll sit and dream of that glad morn
2463,VIII,We met by banks with elder snowing;
2464,VIII,"That dusk we strolled through flower and thorn,"
2465,VIII,"By tasseled meads of cane and corn,"
2466,VIII,To where the stream was flowing.
2467,VIII,
2468,VIII,Again I ’ll oar our boat among
2469,VIII,"The dripping lilies of the river,"
2470,VIII,"To reach her hat, the grape-vine long"
2471,VIII,Struck in the stream; we ’ll row to song;
2472,VIII,And then ... I ’ll wake and shiver.
2473,VIII,
2474,VIII,Why is it that my mind reverts
2475,VIII,To that sweet past? while full of parting
2476,VIII,The present is: so full of hurts
2477,VIII,"And heartache, that what it asserts"
2478,VIII,Adds only to the smarting.
2479,VIII,
2480,VIII,How often shall I sit and think
2481,VIII,Of that sweet past! through lowered lashes
2482,VIII,What-might-have-been trace link by link;
2483,VIII,Then watch it gradually sink
2484,VIII,And crumble into ashes.
2485,VIII,
2486,VIII,Outside I ’ll hear the sad wind weep
2487,VIII,"Like some lone spirit, grieved, forsaken;"
2488,VIII,"Then, shuddering, to bed will creep,"
2489,VIII,"To lie awake, or, haply, sleep"
2490,VIII,A sleep by visions shaken.
2491,VIII,
2492,VIII,"By visions of the past, that draw"
2493,VIII,The present in a hue that’s wanting;
2494,VIII,"A scarecrow thing of sticks and straw,--"

2511,IX,To her young face and feel the light
2512,IX,Of eyes that met my own unsaddened!
2513,IX,Her laugh that left lips more serene;
2514,IX,Her speech that blossomed like the white
2515,IX,Life-everlasting there and gladdened.
2516,IX,

3440,IX,"On the gusty casement, clapping--"
3441,IX,The sound of the storm like a sheet
3442,IX,My soul and senses wrapping.
3443,IX,
3444,IX,"Wild weather. And how is she,"
3445,IX,Now the rush of the rain falls serried
3446,IX,There on the turf and the tree
3447,IX,Of the place where she is buried?
3448,IX,
3449,IX,Wild weather. How black and deep
3450,IX,Is the night where the mad winds scurry!--
3451,IX,Do I sleep? do I dream in my sleep
3452,IX,That I hear her footsteps hurry?
3453,IX,
3454,IX,Hither they come like flowers--
3455,IX,"And I see her raiment glisten,"
3456,IX,Like the robes of one of the hours
3457,IX,Where the stars to the angels listen.
3458,IX,
3459,IX,"Before me, behold, how she stands!"
3460,IX,"With lips high thoughts have weighted,"
3461,IX,"With testifying hands,"
3462,IX,And eyes with glory sated.
3463,IX,
3464,IX,I have spoken and I have kneeled:
3465,IX,I have kissed her feet in wonder--
3466,IX,"But, lo! her lips--they are sealed,"
3467,IX,"God-sealed, and will not sunder."
3468,IX,
3469,IX,"Though I sob, “Your stay was long!"
3470,IX,"You are come,--but your feet were laggard!--"
3471,IX,With mansuetude and song
3472,IX,For the heart your death has daggered.”
3473,IX,
3474,IX,"Never a word replies,"
3475,IX,"Never, to all my weeping--"
3476,IX,"Only a sound of sighs,"
3477,IX,And of raiment past me sweeping....
3478,IX,
3479,IX,I wake; and a clock tolls three--
3480,IX,And the night and the storm beat serried
3481,IX,There on the turf and the tree
3482,IX,Of the place where she is buried.

3491,I,
3492,I,And he had lived such loveless years
3493,I,That suffering had made him wise;
3494,I,And she had known no graver tears
3495,I,Than those of girlhood’s eyes.
3496,I,
3497,I,"And he, perhaps, had loved before--"
3498,I,"One, who had wedded, or had died;--"
3499,I,So life to him had been but poor
3500,I,In love for which he sighed.
3501,I,
3502,I,In years and heart she was so young
3503,I,"Love paused and beckoned at the gate,"
3504,I,"And bade her hear his songs, unsung;"
3505,I,She laughed that “love must wait.”
3506,I,
3507,I,He understood. She only knew
3508,I,"Love’s hair was faded, face was gray--"
3509,I,Nor saw the rose his autumn blew
3510,I,There in her heedless way.
3511,I,
3512,I,
3513,II,II
3514,II,
3515,II,If he had come to her when May
3516,II,"Danced down the wildwood,--every way"
3517,II,"Marked with white flow’rs, as if her gown"
3518,II,"Had torn and fallen,--it might be"
3519,II,"She had not met him with a frown,"
3520,II,Nor used his love so bitterly.
3521,II,
3522,II,Or if he had but come when June
3523,II,"Set stars and roses to one tune,"
3524,II,And breathed in honeysuckle throats
3525,II,"Clove-honey of her spicy mouth,"
3526,II,His heart had found some loving notes
3527,II,In hers to cheer his life’s long drouth.
3528,II,
3529,II,"He came when Fall made mad the sky,"
3530,II,And on the hills leapt like a cry
3531,II,Of battle; when his youth was dead;
3532,II,"To _her_, the young, the wild, the white;"
3533,II,"Whose symbol was the rose, blood-red,"
3534,II,And his the red leaf pinched with blight.
3535,II,
3536,II,"He might have known, since youth was flown,"
3537,II,And autumn claimed him for its own;
3538,II,"And winter neared with snow, wild whirled,"
3539,II,His love to her would seem absurd;
3540,II,To youth like hers; whose lip had curled
3541,II,Yet heard him to his last sad word.
3542,II,
3543,II,"Then laughed and--well, his heart denied"
3544,II,The words he uttered then in pride;
3545,II,And he remembered how the gray
3546,II,"Was his of autumn, ah! and hers,"
3547,II,"The rose-hued colors of the May,"
3548,II,And May was all her universe.
3549,II,
3550,II,"And then he left her: and, like blood,"
3551,II,"In her deep hair, the rose; whose bud"
3552,II,"Was badge to her: while unto him,"
3553,II,"His middle-age, must still remain"
3554,II,"The red-leaf, withering at the rim,"
3555,II,As symbol of the all-in-vain.
3556,II,
3557,II,
3558,III,III
3559,III,
3560,III,"“Such days as these,” she said, and bent"
3561,III,"Among her marigolds, all dew,"
3562,III,"And dripping zinnia stems, “were meant"
3563,III,For spring not autumn; days we knew
3564,III,In childhood; _these_ endearing those;
3565,III,Much dearer since they have grown old:
3566,III,"Days, once imperfect with the rose,"
3567,III,Now perfect with the marigold.”
3568,III,
3569,III,"“Such days as these,” he said, and gazed"
3570,III,Long with unlifted eyes that held
3571,III,"Sad autumn nights, “our hopes have raised"
3572,III,In futures that are mist-enspelled.
3573,III,And so it is the fog blows in
3574,III,Days dearer for the death they paint
3575,III,"With hues of life and joy,--as sin,"
3576,III,"At death, puts off all earthly taint.”"
3577,III,
3578,III,
3579,IV,IV
3580,IV,
3581,IV,Like deeds of hearts that have not kept
3582,IV,"Their riches, as a miser, when"
3583,IV,"Sad souls have asked, with eyes that wept,"
3584,IV,"Among the toiling tribes of men,"
3585,IV,The summer days gave Earth sweet alms
3586,IV,"In silver of white lilies, while"
3587,IV,"Each night, with healing, outstretched palms"
3588,IV,Stood Christ-like with its starry smile.
3589,IV,
3590,IV,Will she remember him when dull
3591,IV,Months drag their duller hours by?
3592,IV,With feet that crush the beautiful
3593,IV,And leave the beautiful to die?
3594,IV,Or never see? nor sit with lost
3595,IV,"Dreams withered, ’mid hope’s empty husks,"
3596,IV,"And wait, heart-counting-up the cost"
3597,IV,Of love’s illusions ’mid life’s dusks?

3605,V,"Who sees no sea, but, through a world of surf,"
3606,V,Gray ghosts of gulls and screaming petrel flocks:
3607,V,"When, from the deep’s white ruin and wild wreck,"
3608,V,"Above the fog, beneath the ghostly gull,"
3609,V,The iron ribs of some storm-shattered hull
3610,V,"Loom, packed with pirate treasure to the deck"
3611,V,"A century rotten: feels his wealth replete,"
3612,V,When long-baulked ocean claims it; and one dull

3620,VI,"On fire with flowers, and the chill dew turns"
3621,VI,"The maple trees, above geranium urns,"
3622,VI,"To Emir tents, and strings with flawless gems"
3623,VI,The moon-flower and the wahoo-bush that burns;
3624,VI,"Calmly she sees the year grow sad and strange,"
3625,VI,And stands with one among the wilted walks
3626,VI,"Of the old garden of the gray, old grange,"
3627,VI,And feels no sorrow for the frost-maimed stalks
3628,VI,Since--though the wailing autumn to her talks--
3629,VI,Youth marks swift spring on life’s far mountain-range.
3630,VI,Or she will lean to her old harpsichord;
3631,VI,A youthful face beside her; and the glow
3632,VI,Of hickory on the hearth will balk the blow
3633,VI,Of blustering rain that beats the casement hard;
3634,VI,And sing of summer and so thwart the snow.
3635,VI,
3636,VI,"“Haply, some day, she yet may sit alone,”"
3637,VI,"He thinks, “within the shadow-saddened house,"
3638,VI,"When round the gables stormy echoes moan,"
3639,VI,And in the closet gnaws the lonesome mouse;
3640,VI,And Memory come stealing down the stair
3641,VI,From dusty attics where is piled the Past--
3642,VI,Like so much rubbish that we hate to keep--
3643,VI,"And turn the knob; and, framed in frosty hair,"
3644,VI,"A grave, forgotten face look in at last,"

3653,I,I
3654,I,
3655,I,"That night, returning to the farm, we rode"
3656,I,"Before a storm. Uprolling from the west,"
3657,I,"Incessant with distending fire, loomed"
3658,I,The multitudes of tempest: towering here
3659,I,"A shadowy Shasta, there a cloudy Hood,"
3660,I,"Veined as with agonies, aurora-born,"
3661,I,"Of torrent gold; resplendent heaven to heaven,"
3662,I,"Far peak to peak, terrific spoke; the vast"
3663,I,"Sierras of the storm, within which beat"
3664,I,The caverned thunder like a mighty stream:
3665,I,"Vibrating on, with rushing wind and flame,"
3666,I,"Now th’ opening welkin shone, one livid sheet"
3667,I,"Of instantaneous gold, a giant’s forge,"
3668,I,"Wild-clanging; now, with streak on angled streak"
3669,I,"Of momentary light, a labyrinth"
3670,I,Where shouting Darkness stalked with Titan torch:
3671,I,Again the firmament hung hewn with fire
3672,I,Whence leapt the thunder; and it seemed that hosts
3673,I,Of Heaven rushed to war with blazing shields
3674,I,And swords of splendor. And before the storm
3675,I,"We galloped, while the frantic trees above"
3676,I,"Went wild with rain, through whose mad limbs and leaves"
3677,I,"Splashed black the first big drops. On, on we drove,"
3678,I,"And gained the gates, pillaring the avenue"
3679,I,"Of ancient beech, at whose far, flickering end,"
3680,I,"At last, beaconed the lights of home."
3681,I,
3682,I,And she?
3683,I,Was it the lightning that lent lividness
3684,I,And terror to her countenance? or fear
3685,I,Of her own heart? revulsion? memory?
3686,I,"Did deep regret, that, now the thing _was_ done,"
3687,I,"That she was mine, a yearning to be free,"
3688,I,"Away from me, assail her? or, the thought,"
3689,I,"The knowledge, that she did not love the man"
3690,I,Whom she had wedded? knowing better now
3691,I,"That all her heart was Julien’s from the first,"
3692,I,And would be Julien’s until the end.
3693,I,And did she now look backward on the past?
3694,I,Or forward--on the barrier that the church
3695,I,For all the future years had placed between
3696,I,The possible and impossible? God knows!
3697,I,
3698,I,Yet I had won her honestly with words
3699,I,"Love, only, uttered out of its soul’s truth;"
3700,I,Had won her--was it openly?--perhaps!--
3701,I,Although engaged to Julien.--What else
3702,I,"Had led us to elopement?--Well, ’t was done!"
3703,I,"The whole, mad, lovely, miserable affair"
3704,I,Of love and youthful folly. Being done
3705,I,"We must abide the reckoning. That is,"
3706,I,_I_ would; and she?--she saw her duty there
3707,I,"Beside her husband. And within myself,"
3708,I,"When we alighted from the carriage, thus,--"
3709,I,"Beneath the porch,--my mind resolved the thing:"
3710,I,"“I am her husband now, and she my wife."
3711,I,"Less than her husband, I, much less a man,"
3712,I,Were I not able to regain and keep
3713,I,"The love she gave me, that she thinks is his,"
3714,I,That is not his. ’T is pity merely now
3715,I,"That makes her pensive. I am pensive, too,"
3716,I,"For Julien, the poet and the friend;"
3717,I,The dreamer and the lover.--But all ’s fair
3718,I,"In love they say; and I,--well, willingly"
3719,I,I’ll bear the burthen of the blame of all.”
3720,I,Scarce had we entered when high heaven oped
3721,I,Vast gates of bronze and doors of booming brass
3722,I,"That dammed a deluge, and the deluge poured.--"
3723,I,I thought of him still; for I felt that she
3724,I,"Was thinking too of Julien and his moods,"
3725,I,"That often swept his soul with storm like this,"
3726,I,Yet oftener with sunlight than with storm;
3727,I,"That soul of sun and tempest, ray and rain,"
3728,I,My school-friend Julien! whom once she won
3729,I,To think she loved--I know not how. My play
3730,I,"Was open as the morning, and as fair."
3731,I,"His poverty and genius here, and here"
3732,I,My wealth and--platitude; and I had won.
3733,I,But it was hard for him. I did not dream
3734,I,That it would end so. And when Gwendolyn
3735,I,Used every gentleness--and that is much--
3736,I,I did not dream his poet’s temperament
3737,I,"Were so affected of a love affair,"
3738,I,"A wrong or right; he, whose sole aim seemed song."
3739,I,"I did not dream he ’d take it desperately,"
3740,I,And end so tragically. Who ’d have thought
3741,I,"His character, although so sensitive,"
3742,I,Would fall into extremes of morbidness
3743,I,"And melancholy! Had it now been I,"
3744,I,"Whose heart had lost in the great game of love,"
3745,I,None would have wondered; for I am of those
3746,I,"Whose vigorous iron does not bend, but break"
3747,I,At one decisive blow: _his_ should have sprung--
3748,I,"Or so I think, not broken as it had--"
3749,I,Elastic as fine-tempered steel that bends
3750,I,And then resumes its usual usefulness.
3751,I,
3752,I,A pale smile strained the corners of her mouth
3753,I,"When, from the porch, into the parlor’s blaze"
3754,I,"I led her. And her mother met us there,"
3755,I,Her mother and her father. And I saw
3756,I,The slow reflection of their happiness
3757,I,"Make glad her eyes, as their approval grew"
3758,I,"From half-severe rebukes, that were well meant,"
3759,I,"To open, glad avowal of their joy."
3760,I,"She had done well, and we were soon forgiven...."
3761,I,
3762,I,But I resumed _his_ letter when alone:
3763,I,"His letter written her three months before,"
3764,I,"When all was over, and we two were one,"
3765,I,And well upon our way to Italy
3766,I,"For six sweet months of honeymoon. His word,"
3767,I,"His letter, all of her, that came to me"
3768,I,"At Venice, that I opened in mistake,"
3769,I,Amid a lot of papers sent from home.
3770,I,"She had not read, and never should while I"
3771,I,Had power to conceal until I ’d read.
3772,I,I would not let the dead scrawl mar or soil
3773,I,"My late-won joy, my testament of love."
3774,I,"No! I would read it, afterwards destroy."
3775,I,"Thoughts made of music for a last farewell,"
3776,I,When he knew all and asked her to perpend
3777,I,Expressions of past things her gift of love
3778,I,Had given speech to in the happy days.
3779,I,And so I read:--
3780,I,
3781,I,
3782,II,II
3783,II,
3784,II,"“The rhyme is mine, but yours"
3785,II,"The thought and all the music, springing from"
3786,II,The rareness of the love that dawned on me
3787,II,A little while to make my sad life glad.
3788,II,"Should I regret the sunset it refused,"
3789,II,Since all my morn was richer than the world?
3790,II,Or that my day should stride without a change
3791,II,"Of crimson, or of purple, or of gold,"
3792,II,Into the barren blackness where the moon
3793,II,"And all God’s stars lay dead? Should I complain,"
3794,II,"Upbraid or censure or one moment curse,"
3795,II,_I_ with my morning? ’T is a memory
3796,II,That stains the midnight now: one wild-rose ray
3797,II,Laid like a finger pointing me the path
3798,II,"I follow, and I go rejoicingly."
3799,II,
3800,II,Our love was very young (nor had it aged--
3801,II,"If we had lived long lifetimes--here in me),"
3802,II,"When one day, strolling in the sun, you spoke"
3803,II,Words I perceived should hint a coming change:
3804,II,"I made three stanzas of the thought, you see:"
3805,II,"But now ’t is like the sea-shell that suggests,"
3806,II,And still associates us with the sea
3807,II,In its vague song and elfland workmanship.
3808,II,Yet it has lost a something that it had
3809,II,"There by the far sand’s foaming; something rare,"
3810,II,A different beauty like an element:
3811,II,
3812,II,I wonder on what life will do
3813,II,When love is loser of all love;
3814,II,When life still longs to love anew
3815,II,And has not love enough:--
3816,II,"I ’ll turn my heart into a ray,"
3817,II,And wait--a day?
3818,II,
3819,II,I wonder on what love will hold
3820,II,When life is weary of all life;
3821,II,And life and love have both grown old
3822,II,With scars of sin and strife:--
3823,II,"I’ll change my soul into a flower,"
3824,II,And wait--an hour?
3825,II,
3826,II,I wonder on why men forget
3827,II,The life that love made laugh; and why
3828,II,Weak women will remember yet
3829,II,The life that love made sigh:--
3830,II,"I’ll sing my thought into a song,"
3831,II,And wait--how long?
3832,II,
3833,II,
3834,III,III
3835,III,
3836,III,"“And once you questioned of our mocking-bird,"
3837,III,"And of the German nightingale, and I"
3838,III,"Knowing a sweeter bird than those sweet two,"
3839,III,Made fast associates of birds and brooks
3840,III,And learned their numbers. Middle April made
3841,III,The path of lilac leading to your porch
3842,III,A rift of fallen Paradise; a blue
3843,III,So full of fragrance that the birds that built
3844,III,"Among the lilacs thought that God was there,"
3845,III,"And of God’s goodness they would sing and sing,"
3846,III,"Till every throat seemed bursting with its song,"
3847,III,"Note on wild note, diviner each than each."
3848,III,"And waiting by the gate, that reached the lane,"
3849,III,"For you, who gave sweet eloquence to all,"
3850,III,"The afternoon, the lilacs and the spring,"
3851,III,My heart was singing and it sang of you:
3852,III,
3853,III,Two glow-worms are the jewels in
3854,III,Her ears; and underneath her chin
3855,III,A diamond like a firefly:
3856,III,There is no starlight in the sky
3857,III,When Gwendolyn stands in the maze
3858,III,"Of woodbine, near the portico;"
3859,III,"For all the stars are in her gaze,"
3860,III,The night and stars I know.
3861,III,
3862,III,A clinging dream of mist the lawn
3863,III,She wears; and like a bit of dawn
3864,III,Her fan with one red jewel pinned:
3865,III,Among the boughs there breathes no wind
3866,III,When Gwendolyn comes down the path
3867,III,Of lilacs from the portico;
3868,III,"For all the breeze her coming hath,"
3869,III,The beam and breeze I know.
3870,III,
3871,III,Two locust-blooms her hands; and slips
3872,III,Of eglantine her cheeks and lips;
3873,III,"Her hair, a hyacinth of gloom:"
3874,III,The balmy buds give no perfume
3875,III,"When Gwendolyn draws near to me,"
3876,III,The gate beyond the portico;
3877,III,"For all aroma sweet is she,"
3878,III,All fragrance that I know.
3879,III,
3880,III,"Life, love, and faith are in her face,"
3881,III,And in her presence all their grace:
3882,III,"And my religion is a word,"
3883,III,"A wish of hers. No mocking-bird,"
3884,III,"When Gwendolyn laughs near, dare float"
3885,III,One bubble from the portico;
3886,III,"For all of song is in her throat,"
3887,III,All music that I know.
3888,III,
3889,III,
3890,IV,IV
3891,IV,
3892,IV,“The mocking-bird! and then weird fancy filled
3893,IV,"My soul with vision, and I saw a song"
3894,IV,Pursue a bird that was no bird--a voice
3895,IV,"Concealed in dim expressions of the spring,--"
3896,IV,"Who sits among the forests and the fields,"
3897,IV,"With dark-blue eyes smiling to life the flowers,--"
3898,IV,Where we strolled happy as the April hills:
3899,IV,
3900,IV,"A sunbeam, all the day that fell"
3901,IV,"Upon the fountain,--"
3902,IV,Like laughter gurgling in the dell
3903,IV,"Below the mountain,--"
3904,IV,"Drank, with its sparkle, one by one,"
3905,IV,"The water-words that, in the sun,"
3906,IV,"Made melody,--the sun-rays tell,--"
3907,IV,That never yet was done.
3908,IV,
3909,IV,"A moon-ray, that had gone astray"
3910,IV,"’Mid wildwood alleys,"
3911,IV,Where Echo haunts the forest way
3912,IV,"Among the valleys,"
3913,IV,The livelong night upon the rocks
3914,IV,"Slept, hid among girl Echo’s locks,"
3915,IV,"And stole her voice,--the moonbeams say,--"
3916,IV,That mocks and only mocks.
3917,IV,
3918,IV,"A shadow, that had made its seat"
3919,IV,Amid the roses
3920,IV,And thorns--the bitter and the sweet
3921,IV,That life discloses--
3922,IV,Mixed with the rose-balm and the dew
3923,IV,"And crimson thorns that pierced it through,"
3924,IV,"Until its soul,--the shades repeat,--"
3925,IV,"Was portion of them, too."
3926,IV,
3927,IV,"A Fairy found the beam of gold,"
3928,IV,And ray of glitter;
3929,IV,"The shadow, whose dim soul did hold"
3930,IV,Both sweet and bitter;
3931,IV,"And made a bird, that haunts the morn"
3932,IV,"And night; that flits from flower to thorn,"
3933,IV,"A voice of laughter,--it is told,--"
3934,IV,"Love, mockery, and scorn."

3938,V,
3939,V,"“Among the white haw-blossoms, where the creek"
3940,V,"Droned under drifts of dogwood and of haw,"
3941,V,"The red-bird, like a crimson blossom blown"
3942,V,"Against the snow-white bosom of the Spring,"
3943,V,"The chaste confusion of her lawny breast,"
3944,V,"Sang on, prophetic of serener days,"
3945,V,As confident as June’s completer hours.
3946,V,"And I stood listening like a hind, who hears"
3947,V,A wood-nymph breathing in a forest flute
3948,V,Among gray beech-trees of myth-haunted ways:
3949,V,"And when it ceased, the memory of the air"
3950,V,Blew like a syrinx in my brain: I made
3951,V,A lyric of the notes that men might know:
3952,V,
3953,V,He flies with flirt and fluting--
3954,V,As flies a falling star
3955,V,From flaming star-beds shooting shooting--
3956,V,From where the roses are.
3957,V,
3958,V,Wings past and sings; and seven
3959,V,"Notes, sweet as fragrance is,--"
3960,V,"That turn to sylphs in heaven,--"
3961,V,Float round him full of bliss.
3962,V,
3963,V,He sings; each burning feather
3964,V,"Thrills, throbbing at his throat;"
3965,V,"A song of glow-worm weather,"
3966,V,And of a firefly boat:
3967,V,
3968,V,Of Elfland and a princess
3969,V,"Who, born of a perfume,"
3970,V,"His music lulls,--where winces"
3971,V,That rose’s cradled bloom.
3972,V,
3973,V,"No bird is half so airy,"
3974,V,"No bird of dusk or dawn,"
3975,V,O masking King of Fairy!
3976,V,O red-crowned Oberon.

3981,VI,“Alas! the nightingale I never heard.
3982,VI,"Yet I, remembering how your voice would thrill"
3983,VI,"Me with exalted expectation, felt"
3984,VI,The passion-throated nightingale would win
3985,VI,"Into my soul in some wild way like this,"
3986,VI,"With reminiscences of dusks long dead,"
3987,VI,"Presentiments of nights, that mate the flowers"
3988,VI,"And the prompt stars, and marry them with song."
3989,VI,"Of such,--love whispered me when deep in dreams,--"
3990,VI,I made my nightingale. It is a voice
3991,VI,Heard in the April of our year of love:
3992,VI,
3993,VI,Between the stars and roses
3994,VI,"There lies a path no man may see,"
3995,VI,Where every breeze that blows is
3996,VI,A wandering melody;
3997,VI,Down which each bright star gazes
3998,VI,Upon each rose that raises
3999,VI,"Its face up lovingly,"
4000,VI,As if with prayers and praises.
4001,VI,
4002,VI,The star and rose are wiser
4003,VI,Than all but love beneath the skies;
4004,VI,No hoard of any miser
4005,VI,Is rich as these are wise:
4006,VI,"No bee may reach or rifle,"
4007,VI,No mist may cloud or stifle
4008,VI,"Their love that never dies,"
4009,VI,That knows nor trick nor trifle.
4010,VI,
4011,VI,There is a bird that carries
4012,VI,Love-messages; and comes and goes
4013,VI,"Between each star that tarries,"
4014,VI,And every rose that blows:
4015,VI,"A bird that can not tire,"
4016,VI,"Whose throat ’s a throbbing lyre,"
4017,VI,"Whose song is now a rose,"
4018,VI,And now a starry fire.
4019,VI,
4020,VI,
4021,VII,VII
4022,VII,
4023,VII,“O May-time woods! O May-time lanes and hours!
4024,VII,"And stars, that knew how often there at night"
4025,VII,"Beside the path, where woodbine odors blew"
4026,VII,"Between the drowsy eyelids of the dusk,--"
4027,VII,"When, like a great, white, pearly moth, the moon"
4028,VII,"Hung, silvering long windows of your room,--"
4029,VII,I stood among the shrubs! The dark house slept.
4030,VII,I watched and waited for--I know not what--
4031,VII,Some tremor of your gown: a velvet leaf’s
4032,VII,Unfolding to caresses of the spring:
4033,VII,A rustle of your footsteps: or the dew
4034,VII,"That softly rolled, a syllable of love,"
4035,VII,"In sweet avowal, from a rose’s lips"
4036,VII,Of odorous scarlet: or the whispered word
4037,VII,Of something lovelier than new leaf or rose--
4038,VII,The word young lips half murmur in a dream:
4039,VII,
4040,VII,"Serene with sleep, light visions load her eyes;"
4041,VII,And underneath her window blooms a quince.
4042,VII,The night is a sultana who doth rise
4043,VII,"In slippered caution, to admit a prince,"
4044,VII,"Love, who her eunuchs and her lord defies."
4045,VII,
4046,VII,Are these her dreams? or is it that the breeze
4047,VII,"Pelts me with petals of the quince, and lifts"
4048,VII,The Balm-of-Gilead buds? and seems to squeeze
4049,VII,Aroma on aroma through sweet rifts
4050,VII,"Of Eden, dripping from the rainy trees?"
4051,VII,
4052,VII,Along the path the buckeye trees begin
4053,VII,"To heap their hills of blossoms.--Oh, that they"
4054,VII,"Were Romeo ladders, whereby I might win"
4055,VII,"Her chamber’s sanctity,--where love must pray"
4056,VII,And guard her soul!--so stainless of all sin!
4057,VII,
4058,VII,There might I see the balsam scent erase
4059,VII,Its sweet intrusion; and the starry night
4060,VII,Conclude majestic pomp; the virgin grace
4061,VII,"Of every bud abashed before the white,"
4062,VII,Pure passion-flower of her sleeping face.

4066,VIII,
4067,VIII,"“And once, in early May, a sparrow sang"
4068,VIII,Among the garden bushes; and you asked
4069,VIII,If the suave song stayed knocking at my heart.
4070,VIII,"I smiled some answer, and, behold, that night"
4071,VIII,Found that my heart had locked this fancy in:
4072,VIII,
4073,VIII,"Rain, rain, and a ribbon of song"
4074,VIII,Uncurled where the blossoms are sprinkled;
4075,VIII,"The song-sparrow sings, and I long"
4076,VIII,"For, the silver-sweet throat, that has tinkled,"
4077,VIII,"To sing in the bloom and the rain,"
4078,VIII,"Sing again, and again, and again,"
4079,VIII,Under my window-pane.
4080,VIII,
4081,VIII,"Rain, rain, and the trickling tips"
4082,VIII,Of the million pink blooms of the quinces;
4083,VIII,"And I hear the song rill from the lips,"
4084,VIII,The lute-haunted lips of my princess:
4085,VIII,"O love! in the rain and the bloom,"
4086,VIII,"Sing again in the pelting perfume,"
4087,VIII,"Sweetheart, under my room."
4088,VIII,
4089,VIII,"Rain, rain, and the dripping of drops"
4090,VIII,"From cups of the blossoms they load, or"
4091,VIII,Tilt over with tipsiest tops:
4092,VIII,"And eyes as of sun-beam and odor,"
4093,VIII,"There, under the bloom-blowing tree--"
4094,VIII,"A face like a flower to see,"
4095,VIII,Love is looking at me.

4100,IX,"“Once in the village I had heard a song,"
4101,IX,"A melody which I wrote down for you,"
4102,IX,"And which you sang. But, there among your hills,"
4103,IX,The dawns and sunsets and the serious stars
4104,IX,"Made trite its thought and words, that seemed as stale"
4105,IX,As musty parlors of the commonplace.
4106,IX,"I changed its words, and here and there its thought,"
4107,IX,"But, though you praised, you never sang it more,"
4108,IX,"And so I knew, like some poor poet, it"
4109,IX,"Had fallen on disfavor, God knows why,"
4110,IX,With its high patron. Thus its metre ran:
4111,IX,"Look, happy eyes, and let me know"
4112,IX,The timid flower her love hath cherished
4113,IX,"Fades not before the fruit shall show,"
4114,IX,Seen in the clear truth of your glow
4115,IX,Where naught of love hath perished.
4116,IX,
4117,IX,"Lift, happy lips, and let me take"
4118,IX,The sacred secret of her spirit
4119,IX,"To mine in kisses, that shall make"
4120,IX,"Mute marriage of our souls, and wake"
4121,IX,The heart’s sweet silence near it.

4125,X,
4126,X,"“And so I wrote another filled with birds,"
4127,X,Deliberate twilight and eve’s punctual star;
4128,X,And made the music of that song obey
4129,X,The metre of my own and melody:
4130,X,
4131,X,"Only to hear that you love me,"
4132,X,Only to feel it is true;
4133,X,"Stars and the gloaming above me,"
4134,X,I in the gloaming with you.
4135,X,"Staining through violet fire,"
4136,X,"A sunset of poppy and gold,"
4137,X,"Red as a heart with desire,"
4138,X,Rich with a secret untold.
4139,X,
4140,X,"Deep where the shadows are doubled,"
4141,X,"Deep where the blossoms are long,"
4142,X,Listen!--deep love in the bubbled
4143,X,Breath of a mocking-bird’s song.
4144,X,"You, who have made them the dearer,"
4145,X,Drawing them near from afar!--
4146,X,"Stars and the heaven the nearer,"
4147,X,"Sweet, through the joy that you are."

4154,XI,"No visible sign, but my own prompting hope’s,"
4155,XI,"Conforming with my heart’s one wild desire,"
4156,XI,Who had not dreaded disappointment there!
4157,XI,"The shadow of a heart’s unformed denial,"
4158,XI,That should take form and soon confirm the doubt:
4159,XI,The doubt that would content itself with this:
4160,XI,
4161,XI,"If I might hold her by the hand,--"
4162,XI,Her hands so full of soothing peace!--
4163,XI,Her heart would hear and understand
4164,XI,"My heart’s demand,"
4165,XI,And all her idling cease.
4166,XI,
4167,XI,If she would let my eyes look in
4168,XI,"Her eyes, whose deeps are full of truth,"
4169,XI,Her soul might see how mine would win
4170,XI,"Her, without sin,"
4171,XI,In all her happy youth.
4172,XI,
4173,XI,"If I might kiss her mouth, and lead"
4174,XI,"The kiss up to her eyes and hair,"
4175,XI,"There is no prayer that so could plead,--"

4185,XII,To sit unbidden through the lonely hours.--
4186,XII,"I cast the shudder off, and in the fields"
4187,XII,"Found hope again, and beauty born of dreams:"
4188,XII,"For it was summer, and all living things,"
4189,XII,"The common flowers and the birds and bees,"
4190,XII,Became interpreters of love for me:
4191,XII,
4192,XII,Say that he can not tell her how he loves her--
4193,XII,"Words, for such adoration, often fail,--"
4194,XII,"When but a bow of ribbon, glove that gloves her,"
4195,XII,Clothes her fair femininity in mail.
4196,XII,
4197,XII,So many ways and wisdoms to express what
4198,XII,To th’ language of devotion is denied;
4199,XII,Ambassadors to make the maiden guess what
4200,XII,Before her heart’s high fortress long has sighed.
4201,XII,
4202,XII,A bird to sing his secret--she’ll perpend him:
4203,XII,A bee to bid her soul to hear and see:
4204,XII,"A blossom, like a sweet appeal, to bend him,"
4205,XII,"Before her there, upon a worshiping knee."

4214,XIII,"All had a poetry so intimate,"
4215,XIII,"So happy and so ready that, for me,"
4216,XIII,"’Twas but to stoop and gather as I went,"
4217,XIII,As one goes reaching roses in the June.
4218,XIII,Three withered wild ones that I gathered then

4220,XIII,
4221,XIII,
4222,XIII,1
4223,XIII,
4224,XIII,What wild-flower shows perfection
4225,XIII,"Such as thy face, no blemish mars?"
4226,XIII,I leave to the selection
4227,XIII,Of all the wild-flower stars:
4228,XIII,"To every wildwood bloom that blows,"
4229,XIII,"Wild phlox, wild daisy, and wild rose."
4230,XIII,
4231,XIII,What cascade hath suspicion
4232,XIII,O’ the marvel that thy whiteness is?
4233,XIII,I leave to the decision
4234,XIII,Of each proclaiming breeze:
4235,XIII,"To winds that kiss the buds awake,"
4236,XIII,And roll the ripple on the lake.
4237,XIII,
4238,XIII,What bird can sing the naming
4239,XIII,Of all the music that thou art?
4240,XIII,I leave to the proclaiming
4241,XIII,Of that within my heart:
4242,XIII,"My heart, wherein, the whole day long,"
4243,XIII,Sits adoration rapt in song.

4251,XIII,Of thine a rose;
4252,XIII,"Thy face an open book, love,"
4253,XIII,"Where beauty gleams and glows,"
4254,XIII,And thought to music set.
4255,XIII,
4256,XIII,"What fairy of the wood,"
4257,XIII,"To whom thou once wast good,"
4258,XIII,"Gave thee this gift?--Thy words, love,"
4259,XIII,Should be pure gold;
4260,XIII,"And all thy songs as bird’s, love,"
4261,XIII,Sweet as the Mays of old
4262,XIII,With youth and love imbued.
4263,XIII,
4264,XIII,What elfin of the glade
4265,XIII,"This white enchantment made,"
4266,XIII,That filled thee with the essence
4267,XIII,Of all the Junes?
4268,XIII,"That made thy soul, thy presence,"
4269,XIII,Like to the moon’s
4270,XIII,Above a far cascade.
4271,XIII,
4272,XIII,What wizard of the cave
4273,XIII,Hath made my heart thy slave?
4274,XIII,"That dreams of thee when sleeping,"
4275,XIII,"And, when awake,"
4276,XIII,My anxious spirit keeping
4277,XIII,"’Neath spells I can not break,"
4278,XIII,"Sweet spells, whence naught can save."
4279,XIII,
4280,XIII,3
4281,XIII,
4282,XIII,"Dear, (though given conclusion to),"
4283,XIII,"Songs,--no memory surrenders,--"
4284,XIII,Still their music breathe in you;
4285,XIII,Silence meditation renders
4286,XIII,Audible with notes it knew.
4287,XIII,
4288,XIII,"Sweet, when all the flowers are dead,"
4289,XIII,"Perfumes,--that the heart remembers"
4290,XIII,"Made of them a marriage-bed,--"
4291,XIII,Shall not fail me in December’s
4292,XIII,"Gloom, but from your face be shed."
4293,XIII,
4294,XIII,"Dear, when night denies a star,"
4295,XIII,"Darkness will not suffer, seeing"
4296,XIII,Song and fragrance are not far;

4305,XIV,"Long, angel goblets molded out of stars,"
4306,XIV,Pouring aroma at your feet: and life
4307,XIV,Took fire with thoughts your soul must help you read:
4308,XIV,
4309,XIV,A song; and songs (who does not know?)
4310,XIV,Reveal no music but is thine.
4311,XIV,"Thou singest, and the waters flow,"
4312,XIV,"The breezes blow,"
4313,XIV,"The sunbeams shine,"
4314,XIV,"And all the earth grows young, divine."
4315,XIV,
4316,XIV,Low laughter; and I look away;
4317,XIV,"Whate’er the time of year, I dream"
4318,XIV,I walk beneath sweet skies of May
4319,XIV,On ways where play
4320,XIV,"Both gloom and gleam,"
4321,XIV,And hear a bird and forest stream.
4322,XIV,
4323,XIV,"A thought; and straight it seems to me,"
4324,XIV,"However dark, the stars arise,"
4325,XIV,"And rain down memories of thee,--"
4326,XIV,"As, it may be,"
4327,XIV,From Paradise
4328,XIV,One feels an angel-lover’s eyes.

4330,XIV,
4331,XV,XV
4332,XV,
4333,XV,“But is it well to tell you what I felt
4334,XV,When I beheld no change beyond the moods
4335,XV,That gloomed or glistened in your raven eyes?
4336,XV,When I sat singing ’neath one steadfast star
4337,XV,Of morning with no phantoms of strange fears
4338,XV,To slay the look or word that helped me sing:
4339,XV,"When song came easier than come buds in spring,"
4340,XV,That make the barren boughs one pomp of pearls:
4341,XV,
4342,XV,"Oh, let the happy day go past,"
4343,XV,"And let the night be short or long,"
4344,XV,"When life and love are one at last,"
4345,XV,"And hearts are full of song,"
4346,XV,"’Tis sweet midsummer of the dream,"
4347,XV,And all the dreams thou hast
4348,XV,Are truer than they seem.
4349,XV,
4350,XV,And once I dreamt in autumn of
4351,XV,Death with cadaverous eyes that gazed
4352,XV,From out a shadow.... It was love
4353,XV,Whose deathless eyes were raised
4354,XV,From the deep darkness that unrolled
4355,XV,"Wild splendor; and, amazed,"
4356,XV,Thy soul I did behold.
4357,XV,
4358,XV,"And then it seemed that some one said,"
4359,XV,The dead are nearer than dost know.
4360,XV,"And when they tell thee love is dead,--"
4361,XV,"Although it seems ’t is so,--"
4362,XV,Still shalt thou feel in every beat
4363,XV,And heart-throb of thy woe
4364,XV,"Love breathing, bitter-sweet."

4366,XV,
4367,XVI,XVI
4368,XVI,
4369,XVI,"“One evening when I came to talk with you,"
4370,XVI,Impatience hurt me in your brief replies.

4372,XVI,"Approaching horror of our lives made maimed,--"
4373,XVI,"The inevitable, could not help but see"
4374,XVI,Some change in you to’ards me.--That night I dreamed
4375,XVI,"I wandered ’mid old ruins, where the snake"
4376,XVI,And scorpion crawled in poison-spotted heat;
4377,XVI,Plague-bloated bulks of hideous vine and root
4378,XVI,Wrapped fallen fanes; and bristling cacti bloomed
4379,XVI,Blood-red and death-white on forgotten tombs.
4380,XVI,And from my soul went forth a bitter cry

4382,XVI,"And pale presentiment. And so I went,"
4383,XVI,"A white flame beckoning before my face,"
4384,XVI,And in my ears sounds of primordial seas
4385,XVI,That boasted preadamic gods and men:
4386,XVI,"A flame before me and, beyond, a voice:"
4387,XVI,"But, lo, the white flame when I reached for it"
4388,XVI,Became thin ashes like a dead man’s dust;
4389,XVI,"And when I thought I should behold the sea,"
4390,XVI,"Stagnation, turned to filth and rottenness,"
4391,XVI,Rolled out a swamp: the voice became a stench.

4393,XVI,If we should pray together now
4394,XVI,"For sunshine and for rain,"
4395,XVI,"And thou shouldst get fair weather now,"

4397,XVI,"Would ray and rain keep single,"
4398,XVI,Or for the rainbow mingle?

4401,XVI,"That I had asked for light,"
4402,XVI,"And God had given shade to me,"
4403,XVI,"And all to thee that’s bright,"

4405,XVI,Refusing darkness morning?
4406,XVI,

4421,XVII,That saw all gladness perish from the world
4422,XVII,"With loss of thee; and, ’mid the future years,"
4423,XVII,Love building high a sepulchre for hope.
4424,XVII,
4425,XVII,"Ah, could you learn forgetfulness,"

4429,XVII,The mornings of the world would burn

4444,XVII,Myself and such in you inspire;

4627,XXII,
4628,XXII,Then I shall not remember: and shall leave
4629,XXII,"No memory behind me, and no trace"
4630,XXII,Of aught my life accomplished. Let none grieve.
4631,XXII,There is no heart my passing will bereave;
4632,XXII,And there are thousands who can fill my place.
4633,XXII,
4634,XXII,Who knocks?--The night camps on each hill and heath:
4635,XXII,And round my door are minions of the night:
4636,XXII,"And like a weapon, riven from its sheath,"
4637,XXII,"The wind sweeps, and the tempest grinds its teeth"
4638,XXII,"Around me and my wild, hand-hollowed light."
4639,XXII,
4640,XXII,Who knocks?--the door is open!--And I see
4641,XXII,"The Darkness threatening, with distorted fists"
4642,XXII,"Of cloudy terror, Courage on her knee:"
4643,XXII,"Shine far, O candle! for it so may be"
4644,XXII,Love is bewildered in the night and mists.--
4645,XXII,
4646,XXII,"No wandering wisp art thou, that haunts the rain"
4647,XXII,"With pallid flicker, fading as it flies!--"
4648,XXII,The door is open!--Will he knock again?--
4649,XXII,The door is open!--Shall it be in vain?--
4650,XXII,"Come in! delay not! thou, whose ways are wise!"
4651,XXII,
4652,XXII,"Who knocked has entered: let the darkness pass,"
4653,XXII,The door be closed!--Now morning lights shall thrust
4654,XXII,It open; and the sunlight shine and mass
4655,XXII,"Its splendor here where once but darkness was,"
4656,XXII,And in its rays--motes and a little dust.”

4859,V,V
4860,V,
4861,V,"Her pearls are blossoms-of-the-vale,"
4862,V,Her only diamonds are the dews;
4863,V,"Such jewels never can grow stale,"
4864,V,Nor any value lose.
4865,V,
4866,V,Among the millet beards she stands:
4867,V,The languid wind lolls everywhere:
4868,V,"There are wild roses in her hands,"
4869,V,One wild rose in her hair.
4870,V,
4871,V,"To-morrow, where the shade is warm,"
4872,V,"Among the unmown wheat she’ll stop,"
4873,V,And from one daisy-loaded arm
4874,V,One ox-eyed daisy drop.
4875,V,
4876,V,"She’ll meet his brown eyes, true and brave,"
4877,V,"With blue eyes, false yet dreamy sweet:"
4878,V,"He is her lover and her slave,"
4879,V,Who mows among the wheat.

4882,V,
4883,V,When buds broke on the apple trees
4884,V,"She wore an apple-blossom dress,"
4885,V,"And laughed with him across the leas,"
4886,V,And love was all a guess.
4887,V,
4888,V,"When goose-plums ripened in the rain,"
4889,V,Plum-colored was her gown of red;
4890,V,He kissed her in the creek-road lane--
4891,V,"She was his life, he said."
4892,V,
4893,V,"When apples thumped the droughty land,"
4894,V,A russet color was her gown:
4895,V,"Another came, and--won her hand?--"
4896,V,Nay! carried off to town....
4897,V,
4898,V,"When grapes hung purple in the hot,"
4899,V,"None missed her and her simple dress,"
4900,V,"Save one, whom, haply, she forgot,"
4901,V,Who loved her none the less.
4902,V,
4903,V,"When snow made white each harvest sheaf,"
4904,V,He sought her out amid her show;
4905,V,"Her rubies, redder than the leaf"
4906,V,That autumn forests sow.
4907,V,
4908,V,Not one regret her shame reveals;
4909,V,"She smiles at him, then puts him by;"
4910,V,He pleads; and she? she merely steels
4911,V,Her heart and--lives her lie.
4912,V,
4913,V,
4914,VI,VI
4915,VI,
4916,VI,And he returned when poppies strewed
4917,VI,"Their golden blots o’er moss and leaf,--"
4918,VI,"Blond little Esaus of the wood,"
4919,VI,"So fair of face, of life so brief.--"
4920,VI,"Did he forget?--Not he, in truth!--"
4921,VI,"“No month,” he thought, “holds so much grace,"
4922,VI,"No month of spring, such grace and youth,"
4923,VI,As the sweet April of her face.”
4924,VI,
4925,VI,In fall the frail gerardia
4926,VI,Hung hints of sunset and of dawn
4927,VI,"On root and rock, as if to draw"
4928,VI,"Her lips, remind him of one gone:--"
4929,VI,"Of one unworthy, in pursuit"
4930,VI,"Of butterflies, who does not dream"
4931,VI,"A flower, broken by her foot,"
4932,VI,"Sweeps, helpless, with her down the stream."

4942,I,If you had seen her waiting there
4943,I,"Among the tiger-lily blooms,--"
4944,I,That sowed their jewels everywhere
4945,I,"Among the woodland gleams and glooms,--"
4946,I,"You had confessed her very fair,"
4947,I,And sweeter than the wood’s perfumes.
4948,I,
4949,I,"A country girl with bare brown feet,"
4950,I,"She waits, while day slopes down the deeps:"
4951,I,"The afternoon is dead with heat,"
4952,I,And all the weary shadow sleeps
4953,I,"Like toil, arm-pillowed in the wheat,"
4954,I,Beside the scythe with which he reaps.
4955,I,
4956,I,There is no sound more distant than
4957,I,The cow-bell on the vine-hung hill;
4958,I,No nearer than the locust’s span
4959,I,Of noise that makes the silence shrill:
4960,I,And now there comes a sun-browned man
4961,I,Through tiger-lilies of the rill.
4962,I,
4963,I,"Long will they talk: till, in the end,"
4964,I,"The clear west glows, the east grows pale;"
4965,I,Until the glow and pallor blend
4966,I,Like moonlight on a shifting sail;
4967,I,And then he ’ll clasp her; she will bend
4968,I,"Her head, consenting. Day will fail:"
4969,I,
4970,I,"The west will flame, then fade away"
4971,I,"Through heavy orange, rose, and red,"
4972,I,And leave the heavens violet gray
4973,I,Above a gypsy-lily bed:
4974,I,Then they will go; and he will say
4975,I,Such words to her as none has said.
4976,I,
4977,I,A million stars the night will win
4978,I,Above them; and one firefly
4979,I,Pulse like a tangled starbeam in
4980,I,The cedar dark against the sky:
4981,I,Then he will lift her dimpled chin
4982,I,And take the kiss she ’ll not deny.
4983,I,
4984,I,"And when the moon, like the great book"
4985,I,"Of Judgment, golden with the light"
4986,I,"Of God, lies open o’er yon nook"
4987,I,"Of darkest wood and wildest height,"
4988,I,Together they will cross the brook
4989,I,And reach the gate and kiss good night.
4990,I,
4991,I,
4992,II,II
4993,II,
4994,II,And now he wipes his hand along
4995,II,The beaded fire of his brow
4996,II,Hard toil has heated; and the strong
4997,II,Face flushes fuller health as now
4998,II,"He fills his hay-fork to the prong,"
4999,II,"And, tossing it, again doth bow."
5000,II,
5001,II,"And now he rests, and looks away"
5002,II,Across the sun-fierce hills and meads
5003,II,No rolling cloud has cooled to-day;
5004,II,And from his face the brawny beads
5005,II,"Drip; and he marks the heaps of hay,"
5006,II,"The fields of corn, the fields of weeds."
5007,II,
5008,II,At last he sees the tempest build
5009,II,"Black battlements along the west,"
5010,II,Black breastworks that are thunder filled;
5011,II,And bares his brow; and on his chest
5012,II,The sweat of toil is cooled; and stilled
5013,II,The pulse of toil within his breast.
5014,II,
5015,II,A strong wind brings the odorous death
5016,II,"Of far hay-meadows, and the scent"
5017,II,Is good within his nostrils’ breath:
5018,II,"The mighty trees are bowed, that leant"
5019,II,"For no man, as when Power saith"
5020,II,“Bow down!” and stalwart men are bent.
5021,II,
5022,II,"He laughs, long-gazing as he goes"
5023,II,Along the elder-sweetened lane:
5024,II,He feels the storm wind as it blows
5025,II,"Across the sheaves of golden grain,"
5026,II,"And stops to pull one bramble-rose,"
5027,II,And watch the swiftly coming rain.
5028,II,
5029,II,"And there, ’mid locust trees, the farm"
5030,II,Dreams in a martin-haunted place:
5031,II,He marks the far-off streaks of storm
5032,II,"That, driven of the thunder, race:"
5033,II,"He sees his child upon her arm,"
5034,II,And in the door his wife’s fair face.
5035,II,

5038,III,
5039,III,"Below the sunset’s range of rose,"
5040,III,"Below the heaven’s bending blue,"
5041,III,"Down woodways where the balsam blows,"
5042,III,"And milkweed tufts hang, gray of hue,"
5043,III,A Jersey heifer stops and lows--
5044,III,"The cows come home by one, by two."
5045,III,
5046,III,There is no star yet: but the smell
5047,III,Of hay and pennyroyal mix
5048,III,With herb-aromas of the dell;
5049,III,And the root-hidden cricket clicks:
5050,III,Among the ironweeds a bell
5051,III,Clangs near the rail-fenced clover-ricks.
5052,III,
5053,III,She waits upon the slope beside
5054,III,"The windlassed well the plum-trees shade,"
5055,III,The well-curb that the goose-plums hide;
5056,III,"Her light hand on the bucket laid,"
5057,III,"Unbonneted she waits, glad-eyed,"
5058,III,Her dress as simple as her braid.
5059,III,
5060,III,She sees fawn-colored backs among
5061,III,The sumacs now; a tossing horn;
5062,III,A clashing bell of brass that rung:
5063,III,"Long shadows lean upon the corn,"
5064,III,"And all the day dies scarlet-stung,"
5065,III,The cloud in it a rosy thorn.
5066,III,
5067,III,"Below the pleasant moon, that tips"
5068,III,"The tree-tops of the hillside, fly"
5069,III,The evening bats; the twilight slips
5070,III,Some fireflies like spangles by;
5071,III,"She meets him, and their happy lips"
5072,III,Touch; and one star leaps in the sky.
5073,III,
5074,III,"He takes her bucket, and they speak"
5075,III,Of married hopes while in the grass
5076,III,The plum lies glowing as her cheek;
5077,III,The patient cows look back or pass;
5078,III,And in the west one golden streak
5079,III,Burns like a great cathedral glass.
5080,III,
5081,III,
5082,IV,IV
5083,IV,
5084,IV,"The skies are amber, blue, and green"
5085,IV,Before the coming of the sun;
5086,IV,"And all the deep hills sleep, serene"
5087,IV,As if enchanted; every one
5088,IV,Is ribbed with morning mists that lean
5089,IV,On woods through which vague whispers run.
5090,IV,
5091,IV,"Birds wake: and on the vine-hung knobs,"
5092,IV,"Above the brook, a twittering"
5093,IV,Confuses songs; one warbler robs
5094,IV,Another of its note; a wing
5095,IV,Beats by; and now a wild throat throbs
5096,IV,Triumphant; all the woodlands sing.
5097,IV,
5098,IV,The sun is up: the hills are heaped
5099,IV,With instant splendor; and the vales
5100,IV,Surprised with shimmers that are steeped
5101,IV,In purple where the thin mist trails;
5102,IV,"The water-fall, the rock it leaped,"
5103,IV,Are burning gold that foams and fails.
5104,IV,
5105,IV,He drives his horses to the plow
5106,IV,"Along the vineyard slopes, where bask"
5107,IV,"Dew-heavy grapes, half-ripened now,"
5108,IV,In sun-shot shafts of shade: no mask
5109,IV,Of joy he wears; his face and brow
5110,IV,Glow as he enters on his task.
5111,IV,
5112,IV,"Before him, soaring through the mist,"
5113,IV,The gray hawk wildly wings and screams;
5114,IV,"Its dewy back gleams, sunbeam-kissed,"
5115,IV,Above the wood that drips and dreams;
5116,IV,He guides the plow with one strong fist;
5117,IV,The soil rolls back in level seams.
5118,IV,
5119,IV,Packed to the right the sassafras
5120,IV,Lifts leafy walls of spice that shade
5121,IV,"The blackberries, whose tendrils mass"
5122,IV,Big berries in the coolness made;
5123,IV,And drop their ripeness on the grass
5124,IV,Where trumpet-flowers fall and fade.
5125,IV,
5126,IV,White on the left the fence and trees
5127,IV,"That mark the garden; and the smoke,"
5128,IV,"Uncurling in the early breeze,"
5129,IV,Tells of the roof beneath the oak;
5130,IV,"He turns his team, and, turning, sees"
5131,IV,"The damp, dark soil his coulter broke."
5132,IV,
5133,IV,Bees hum; and o’er the berries poise
5134,IV,Lean-bodied wasps; loud blackbirds turn
5135,IV,Following the plow: there is a noise
5136,IV,Of insect wings that buzz and burn;--
5137,IV,"And now he hears his wife’s low voice,"
5138,IV,The song she sings to help her churn.
5139,IV,
5140,IV,
5141,V,V
5142,V,
5143,V,There are no clouds that drift around
5144,V,"The moon’s pearl-kindled crystal, (white"
5145,V,As some sky-summoned spirit wound
5146,V,"In raiment lit with limbs of light),"
5147,V,That have not softened like the sound
5148,V,Of harps when Heaven forgets to smite.
5149,V,
5150,V,"The vales are deeper than the dark,"
5151,V,And darker than the vales the woods
5152,V,That shadowy hill and meadow mark
5153,V,"With broad, blurred lines, whereover broods"
5154,V,Deep calm; and now a fox-hound’s bark
5155,V,Upon the quietude intrudes.
5156,V,
5157,V,"And though the night is never still,"
5158,V,Yet what we name its noises makes
5159,V,Its silence:--now a whippoorwill;
5160,V,"A frog, whose hoarser tremor breaks"
5161,V,The hush; then insect sounds that fill
5162,V,The night; an owl that hoots and wakes.
5163,V,
5164,V,They lean against the gate that leads
5165,V,Into the lane that lies between
5166,V,The yard and orchard; flowers and weeds
5167,V,Smell sweeter than the odors keen
5168,V,That day distils from hotness; beads
5169,V,Of dew make cool the gray and green.
5170,V,
5171,V,Their infant sleeps. They feel the peace
5172,V,"Of something done that God has blessed,"
5173,V,Still as the pulse that will not cease
5174,V,There in the cloud that lights the west:
5175,V,The peace of love that shall increase
5176,V,While soul to soul still gives its best.

5213,I,The brow of the man is gnarled and wrinkled
5214,I,With the weight of the words that have just been spoken;
5215,I,"And the girl has smiled and her eyes have twinkled,"
5216,I,Though the bonds and the bands of their love lie broken:
5217,I,"She smiles, nor knows how the days have knotted"
5218,I,Her to the heart of the man who says:
5219,I,“Let us follow the paths that we think allotted.
5220,I,I will go my ways and you your ways.
5221,I,
5222,I,“And the man between us is your decision.
5223,I,Worse or better he is your lover.--
5224,I,Shall I say he ’s worse since the sweet Elysian
5225,I,Prize he wins where I discover
5226,I,Only the hell of the luckless chooser?--
5227,I,"Shall I say he ’s better than I, or more,"
5228,I,"Since he is winner and I am loser,"
5229,I,His life ’s made rich and mine made poor?”
5230,I,
5231,I,“I tell you now as I oft and ever
5232,I,"Have told,” she answered, the laughter dying"
5233,I,"Down in her eyes, “that his arms have never"
5234,I,"Held me!--no!--but you think me lying,"
5235,I,And you are wrong. And I think it better
5236,I,To part forever than still to dwell
5237,I,"With the sad distrust, like an evil tetter,"
5238,I,"On our lives forever, and so farewell.”"
5239,I,
5240,I,"And she turned away; and he watched her going,"
5241,I,The girlish pride in her eyes a-smoulder:
5242,I,"He saw her go, and his lips were glowing"
5243,I,"Fever that parched. And he stood, one shoulder"
5244,I,"Slouched to the tree; and he saw her stooping,"
5245,I,"There by the bank, with a reckless foot;"
5246,I,Straighten; and tear from her breast his drooping
5247,I,Lilies and fasten the pleurisy-root.
5248,I,
5249,I,With its orange fire he saw her passing
5250,I,"On and on; and the blood beat, burning"
5251,I,His brain to madness; and seemingly massing
5252,I,The weight of the world on his heart in yearning ...
5253,I,Butterflies swarmed in the moist sand-alleys;
5254,I,A fairy fleet of Ionian sails
5255,I,"They seemed with their wings, or of pirate galleys,"
5256,I,"Maroon and yellow, for Elfland gales."
5257,I,
5258,I,"He watched her going; and harder, thicker"
5259,I,The pulse of his breath and his heart’s hard throbbing.--
5260,I,How should he know that her heart was sicker?
5261,I,How should he know that her soul was sobbing?--
5262,I,She never looked back: and he saw her vanish
5263,I,"In swirls of the startled butterflies,"
5264,I,Like a storm of flowers; and he could not banish
5265,I,The thought he had lost his all through lies.
5266,I,
5267,I,
5268,II,II
5269,II,
5270,II,He heard the cocks crow out the lonely hours.
5271,II,How long the night! how far away the dawn!
5272,II,"It seemed long months since he had seen the flowers,"
5273,II,"The leaves, the sunlight, and the bee-hived lawn;"
5274,II,Had heard the thrush flute in the tangled showers.
5275,II,
5276,II,"His burning eyes ached, staring at the black"
5277,II,Stolidity of midnight. Would God send
5278,II,"No cool relief unto his mind,--a rack"
5279,II,"Of inquisition,--tortures to unbend,"
5280,II,That stretched him forward and now strained him back?
5281,II,
5282,II,"Incomprehensible and undivulged,"
5283,II,"The thought that took him back, retraced their walks,"
5284,II,"Through woods, on which the sudden perfumes bulged,"
5285,II,The bird-songs and the brilliant-blossomed stalks;
5286,II,And all the freedom which their talk indulged.
5287,II,
5288,II,"Oh, strong appeal! And he would almost yield;"
5289,II,"When, firmly forward, he could feel her fault"
5290,II,"Oppose the error of a rock-like shield,"
5291,II,And to resisting phalanxes cry halt--
5292,II,"And, lo! bright cohorts broken on the field."
5293,II,
5294,II,O mulct of morning! to the despot night
5295,II,"Count down unminted gold, and let the day"
5296,II,Walk free from dungeons of the dark; delight
5297,II,"Herself on mountains of the violet ray,"
5298,II,Clad in white maidenhood and morning white!
5299,II,
5300,II,"A melancholy coast, plunged deep in dream"
5301,II,"And death and silence, stretched the drowsy dark,"
5302,II,"Wherein he heard a round-eyed screech-owl scream,"
5303,II,"In lamentation, and a watch-dog bark,"
5304,II,"Vague as oblivion, lost in night’s deep stream."
5305,II,
5306,II,And then hope moved him to divide the blinds
5307,II,"To see if those bright sparkles were a star’s,"
5308,II,"Or but his feverish eyelids, which the mind’s"
5309,II,Commotion weighed.--No hint of morning bars
5310,II,With glimmer heaven’s swart tapestry he finds.
5311,II,
5312,II,"So he remained, impatient, till the first"
5313,II,"Exploring crevices of Aztec morn,"
5314,II,"Dim cracks of treasure, Eldorados burst:"
5315,II,Then could he face his cowardice and scorn
5316,II,His jealousy that thus his life had cursed.
5317,II,
5318,II,Love knew no barriers now. And where he went
5319,II,Each woodland path was musical with birds;
5320,II,"Each flow’r was richer, more divine of scent;"
5321,II,For love sought love with such expressive words
5322,II,That dawn’s delivery was less eloquent.

5330,III,"Over the Fork, where is lying,"
5331,III,"Bridge-like, a butternut log,"
5332,III,There where the horsemint is drying?
5333,III,
5334,III,"Who is it hunts in the brush,"
5335,III,"Under the linns and the beeches,"
5336,III,"Here where the water-falls rush,"
5337,III,"Dark, where the noon never reaches?"
5338,III,Here where the Fork is one crush
5339,III,Of flags with a bloom like the peach’s?
5340,III,
5341,III,"He is handsome and supple and tall,"
5342,III,"Blond-haired and vigorous-chested,"
5343,III,Blue-eyed as the bud by the fall
5344,III,"Where he listens,--his rifle half rested,"
5345,III,"Half leaned on the crumbling stone wall,--"
5346,III,Whose briers he lately has breasted.
5347,III,
5348,III,He waits; and the sun on the dew
5349,III,Of the cedars and leaves of the bushes
5350,III,Strikes glittering frostiness through ...
5351,III,If a covey of partridges flushes
5352,III,"What good will a Winchester do,"
5353,III,Or the dog to his feet that he crushes?
5354,III,
5355,III,Then a man breaks strong through the weeds
5356,III,Where the buck-bushes toss and the spires
5357,III,Of the white-blossomed cohosh; ’mid reeds
5358,III,"Wild-carrots, and trammelling briers:"
5359,III,It is he! to his loved one who speeds--
5360,III,And the man in the bushes--he fires....
5361,III,
5362,III,From leaves of the wind-shaken wood
5363,III,The dew of the dawn is still falling:
5364,III,"He is gone from the place where he stood,"
5365,III,Just there where the black crow is calling:
5366,III,There is blood on the weeds: is it blood
5367,III,On the face of the man who is crawling?
5368,III,
5369,III,Red blood or a smudge of the dawn?--
5370,III,"Now he lies with his gray eyes wide, staring,"
5371,III,"Stiff, still at the sun: he has drawn"
5372,III,His limbs in a heap: and the faring
5373,III,"Bee-martins light near or pass on,"
5374,III,Not one of them knowing or caring.
5375,III,
5376,III,It is noon: and the wood-dove is deep
5377,III,In the calm of its cooing: and over
5378,III,The tops of the forest trees sweep
5379,III,The shadows of buzzards that hover:
5380,III,Wide-winged they sail on as asleep:
5381,III,And the bob-white is whistling from cover.
5382,III,
5383,III,"It is dusk: and the heat, that made wilt"
5384,III,"The leaves and the wildflowers’ faces,"
5385,III,Gives place to the dew-drops that tilt
5386,III,With coolness the weeds where are traces
5387,III,"Of horror and darkness and guilt,"
5388,III,That nothing can wash from those places.
5389,III,
5390,III,It is night: and the hoot-owlet mocks
5391,III,"The dove of the day with wild weeping,"
5392,III,The Fork is scarce heard on its rocks
5393,III,Where the man is so quietly sleeping:
5394,III,Through the woods snaps the bark of a fox;
5395,III,The lightning is fitfully leaping.
5396,III,
5397,III,
5398,IV,IV
5399,IV,
5400,IV,"All day, ’twixt hope and fear,"
5401,IV,"She waited at the gate,"
5402,IV,"Looking for him, more dear"
5403,IV,Now that he made her wait:
5404,IV,Day went and night draws near:
5405,IV,Stormy it grows and late.
5406,IV,
5407,IV,"Still, still she waits: great limbs"
5408,IV,The winds rend from the ridge;
5409,IV,Each swollen shallow swims
5410,IV,Head-deep below the bridge;
5411,IV,"The drift, that breaks and brims"
5412,IV,Swirls lighter than the midge.
5413,IV,
5414,IV,The night grows wildly gray
5415,IV,With lightning-litten rain;
5416,IV,"The forests sound and sway,"
5417,IV,An oak is rent in twain;
5418,IV,The thunder rolls away
5419,IV,Like some vast bolt and chain.
5420,IV,
5421,IV,The Fork is whirling wreck
5422,IV,Of field and farm and wood;
5423,IV,And many a foaming fleck
5424,IV,Drives where the rock-fence stood;--
5425,IV,A torrent sweeps break-neck
5426,IV,Above the washed-out blood.
5427,IV,
5428,IV,Night deepens: still she waits
5429,IV,Expectant in despair:
5430,IV,"The Fork has reached the gates,"
5431,IV,The wood’s wreck everywhere.
5432,IV,"But when the storm abates,"
5433,IV,"She thinks, he will be there."
5434,IV,
5435,IV,She sees the lightning rush
5436,IV,Its blazing hells above;
5437,IV,She hears the thunder crush
5438,IV,Heaven as if earthquake-clove--
5439,IV,Loud in the tempest’s hush
5440,IV,She calls with all her love.
5441,IV,
5442,IV,"He comes, she feels; and stands"
5443,IV,The rushing waters o’er
5444,IV,"Her feet, and on her hands"
5445,IV,"And hair the wild down-pour,"
5446,IV,The lightnings are wild brands
5447,IV,To light him to her door.
5448,IV,
5449,IV,Night deepens: but she knows
5450,IV,God will not fail to send
5451,IV,"Her love to soothe her woes,"
5452,IV,And one day’s errors mend.--
5453,IV,The wild stream foams and flows
5454,IV,Booming in fall and bend.
5455,IV,
5456,IV,Again the lightnings light
5457,IV,The night like some wild torch;
5458,IV,The waters foam and fight;
5459,IV,And one uprooted larch
5460,IV,"Sweeps down, with something white"
5461,IV,"Wedged in it, by her porch."
5462,IV,
5463,IV,She stoops: the lurid rain
5464,IV,Beats on her back and head--
5465,IV,Ay! he hath come again!
5466,IV,With livid lips once red!
5467,IV,A bullet in his brain
5468,IV,The night hath brought him--dead!

5481,I,My heart will dream.
5482,I,
5483,I,Is it because the wind-flower apes
5484,I,"The beauty that was once her brow,"
5485,I,That the white thought of it still shapes
5486,I,The April now?
5487,I,
5488,I,Because the wild-rose learned its blush
5489,I,"From her fresh cheeks of maidenhood,"
5490,I,Their thought makes June of barren brush
5491,I,And empty wood?
5492,I,

5508,II,"Fresh, redolent with rain."
5509,II,
5510,II,"When orchards are in bloom once more,"
5511,II,Invasions of lost dreams will draw
5512,II,"My feet, like some insistent law,"
5513,II,Through blossoms to her door:
5514,II,"In dreams I’ll ask her, as before,"
5515,II,To let me help her at the well;
5516,II,And fill her pail; and long to tell
5517,II,My love as once of yore.
5518,II,
5519,II,I shall not speak until we quit
5520,II,"The farm-gate, leading to the lane"
5521,II,"And orchard, all in bloom again,"
5522,II,’Mid which the wood-doves sit
5523,II,And coo; and through whose blossoms flit
5524,II,The cat-birds crying while they fly:
5525,II,"Then tenderly I’ll speak, and try"
5526,II,To tell her all of it.
5527,II,
5528,II,And in my dream again she’ll place
5529,II,"Her hand in mine, as oft before,--"
5530,II,"When orchards are in bloom once more,--"
5531,II,With all her old-time grace:
5532,II,And we will tarry till a trace
5533,II,Of sunset dyes the heav’ns; and then--
5534,II,"We’ll part, and, parting, I again"
5535,II,Will bend and kiss her face.
5536,II,
5537,II,"And homeward, dreaming, I will go"
5538,II,"Along the cricket-chirring ways,"
5539,II,"While sunset, like one crimson blaze"
5540,II,"Of blossoms, lingers low:"
5541,II,"And my lost youth again I’ll know,"
5542,II,"And all her love, when spring is here--"
5543,II,Hers! hers! now dead this many a year

5545,II,
5546,II,
5547,III,III
5548,III,
5549,III,I would not die when Springtime lifts
5550,III,"The white world to her maiden mouth,"

5552,III,Breeze-blown from out the singing South:
5553,III,"Too full of life and loves that cling,"
5554,III,"Too heedless of all mortal woe,"
5555,III,"The young, unsympathetic Spring,"
5556,III,That death should never know.
5557,III,
5558,III,I would not die when Summer shakes
5559,III,"Her daisied locks below her hips,"
5560,III,"And, naked as a star that takes"
5561,III,"A cloud, into the silence slips."
5562,III,Too rich is Summer; poor in needs;
5563,III,Wrapped in her own warm loveliness
5564,III,"Her pomp goes by, and never heeds"
5565,III,If one be more or less.
5566,III,
5567,III,"But I would die when Autumn goes,"
5568,III,"The sad rain dripping from her hair,"
5569,III,Through forests where the wild wind blows
5570,III,Death and the red wreck everywhere:
5571,III,Sweet as love’s last farewells and tears
5572,III,"’T would be to die, when heavens are gray,"
5573,III,"In the old autumn of my years,"

5806,WOODLAND WATERS,"And the wild bleeding-heart its shells,"
5807,WOODLAND WATERS,O’er mosses and rocks of the dells
5808,WOODLAND WATERS,The brook of the forest is falling.
5809,WOODLAND WATERS,
5810,WOODLAND WATERS,You can hear it under the hill
5811,WOODLAND WATERS,"When the wind in the wood is still,"
5812,WOODLAND WATERS,"And, strokes of a fairy drill,"
5813,WOODLAND WATERS,Sounds the bill of the yellow-hammer:
5814,WOODLAND WATERS,"By the solomon’s-seal it slips,"
5815,WOODLAND WATERS,Cohosh and the grass that drips--
5816,WOODLAND WATERS,"Like the words of an Undine’s lips,"
5817,WOODLAND WATERS,Is the sound of its falls that stammer.
5818,WOODLAND WATERS,
5819,WOODLAND WATERS,I lie in the woods: and the scent
5820,WOODLAND WATERS,Of the honeysuckle is blent
5821,WOODLAND WATERS,With the sound: and a Sultan’s tent
5822,WOODLAND WATERS,"Is my dream, with the East enmeshéd:--"
5823,WOODLAND WATERS,A slave-girl sings; and I hear
5824,WOODLAND WATERS,"The languor of lute-strings near,"
5825,WOODLAND WATERS,And a dancing-girl of Cashmere
5826,WOODLAND WATERS,In the harem of good Er Reshid.
5827,WOODLAND WATERS,
5828,WOODLAND WATERS,From ripples of Irak lace
5829,WOODLAND WATERS,She flashes the amorous grace
5830,WOODLAND WATERS,"Of her naked limbs and her face,"
5831,WOODLAND WATERS,While her golden anklets tinkle:
5832,WOODLAND WATERS,Then over mosaic floors
5833,WOODLAND WATERS,Open seraglio doors

5835,WOODLAND WATERS,"Like stars that tremble and twinkle,--"
5836,WOODLAND WATERS,

5854,THE THORN-TREE,"With her limbs of samite whiteness and her hair of golden glow,"
5855,THE THORN-TREE,"Whom the boyish South-wind seeks for and the girlish-stepping rain,"

5857,THE THORN-TREE,"She whose Vivien charms were mistress of the magic Merlin knew,"
5858,THE THORN-TREE,That could change the dew to glow-worms and the glow-worms into dew.
5859,THE THORN-TREE,
5860,THE THORN-TREE,"There’s a thorn-tree in the forest, and the fairies know the tree,"
5861,THE THORN-TREE,With its branches gnarled and wrinkled as a face with sorcery;
5862,THE THORN-TREE,"But the May-time brings it clusters of a rainy fragrant white,"
5863,THE THORN-TREE,Like the bloom-bright brows of beauty or a hand of lifted light.
5864,THE THORN-TREE,And all day the silence whispers to the sun-ray of the morn
5865,THE THORN-TREE,How the bloom is lovely Vivien and how Merlin is the thorn:
5866,THE THORN-TREE,How she won the doting wizard with her naked loveliness
5867,THE THORN-TREE,Till he told her demon secrets that but made his magic less.
5868,THE THORN-TREE,
5869,THE THORN-TREE,How she charmed him and enchanted in the thorn-tree’s thorns to lie
5870,THE THORN-TREE,Forever with his passion that should never dim or die:
5871,THE THORN-TREE,"And with wicked laughter looking on this thing that she had done,"
5872,THE THORN-TREE,Like a visible aroma lingered sparkling in the sun;
5873,THE THORN-TREE,"How she stooped to kiss the pathos of an elf-lock of his beard,"
5874,THE THORN-TREE,"All in mockery, at parting, and mock pity of his weird:"
5875,THE THORN-TREE,But her magic had forgotten that “who bends to give a kiss
5876,THE THORN-TREE,Will bring down the curse upon them of the person whose it is”:
5877,THE THORN-TREE,So the silence tells the secret.--And at night the fairies see
5878,THE THORN-TREE,"How the tossing bloom is Vivien, who is struggling to be free,"
5879,THE THORN-TREE,"In the thorny arms of Merlin, who, forever, is the tree."

6442,WOUNDED,It was in August that they brought her news
6443,WOUNDED,Of his bad wounds; the leg that he must lose.
6444,WOUNDED,"And August passed, and when October raised"
6445,WOUNDED,"Red rebel standards on the hills that blazed,"
6446,WOUNDED,"They brought a haggard wreck; she scarce knew whose,"
6447,WOUNDED,"Until they told her, standing stunned and dazed."
6448,WOUNDED,
6449,WOUNDED,"A shattered shadow of the stalwart lad,"
6450,WOUNDED,"The five-months husband, whom his country had"
6451,WOUNDED,"Enlisted, strong for war; returning this,"
6452,WOUNDED,"Whose broken countenance she feared to kiss,"
6453,WOUNDED,"While health’s remembrance stood beside him sad,"
6454,WOUNDED,And grieved for that which was no longer his.
6455,WOUNDED,
6456,WOUNDED,They brought him on a litter; and the day
6457,WOUNDED,Was bright and beautiful. It seemed that May
6458,WOUNDED,In woodland rambles had forgot her path
6459,WOUNDED,"Of season, and, disrobing for a bath,"
6460,WOUNDED,"By the autumnal waters of some bay,"
6461,WOUNDED,With her white nakedness had conquered Wrath.
6462,WOUNDED,
6463,WOUNDED,Far otherwise she wished it: wind and rain;
6464,WOUNDED,"The sky, one gray commiserative pain;"
6465,WOUNDED,"Sleet, and the stormy drift of frantic leaves;"
6466,WOUNDED,To match the misery that each perceives
6467,WOUNDED,"Aches in her hand-clutched bosom, and is plain"
6468,WOUNDED,In eyes and mouth and all her form that grieves.
6469,WOUNDED,
6470,WOUNDED,"Theirs, a mute meeting of the lips; she stooped"
6471,WOUNDED,"And kissed him once: one long, dark side-lock drooped"
6472,WOUNDED,And brushed against the bandage of his breast;
6473,WOUNDED,With feeble hands he held it and caressed;
6474,WOUNDED,"Then all his happiness in one look grouped,"
6475,WOUNDED,"Saying, “Now I am home, I crave but rest.”"
6476,WOUNDED,
6477,WOUNDED,Once it was love! but then the battle killed
6478,WOUNDED,"All that sweet nonsense of his youth, and filled"

6508,THE MESSAGE,And on his face her fancy mused a while:
6509,THE MESSAGE,"“Dark hair, dark eyes.--And now he has a beard"

6514,THE MESSAGE,"Then tried to feature, but could only see"

6519,THE MESSAGE,
6520,THE MESSAGE,Now all around her drowsed the hushful hum
6521,THE MESSAGE,Of evening insects. And his letter spoke
6522,THE MESSAGE,Of love and longings to her: nor awoke
6523,THE MESSAGE,"One echo of the bugle and the drum,"
6524,THE MESSAGE,But all their future in one kiss did sum.

6526,THE MESSAGE,The stars were thick now; and the western blush

6694,LYNCHERS,Where we found her lying stark and dead.
6695,LYNCHERS,
6696,LYNCHERS,"The scraggy wood; the negro hut,"
6697,LYNCHERS,With its doors and windows locked and shut.
6698,LYNCHERS,
6699,LYNCHERS,A secret signal; a foot’s rough tramp;
6700,LYNCHERS,A knock at the door; a lifted lamp.
6701,LYNCHERS,
6702,LYNCHERS,An oath; a scuffle; a ring of masks;
6703,LYNCHERS,A voice that answers a voice that asks.
6704,LYNCHERS,
6705,LYNCHERS,A group of shadows; the moon’s red fleck;
6706,LYNCHERS,A running noose and a man’s bared neck.
6707,LYNCHERS,
6708,LYNCHERS,"A word, a curse, and a shape that swings;"
6709,LYNCHERS,The lonely night and a bat’s black wings.
6710,LYNCHERS,
6711,LYNCHERS,"At the moon’s down-going, let it be"
6712,LYNCHERS,On the quarry hill with its one gnarled tree.

6718,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6719,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6720,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"He rode adown the autumn wood,"
6721,DEAD MAN’S RUN,A man dark-eyed and brown;
6722,DEAD MAN’S RUN,A mountain girl before him stood
6723,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Clad in a homespun gown.
6724,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6725,DEAD MAN’S RUN,“To ride this road is death for you!
6726,DEAD MAN’S RUN,My father waits you there;
6727,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"My father and my brother, too--"
6728,DEAD MAN’S RUN,You know the oath they swear.”
6729,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6730,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"He holds her by one berry-brown wrist,"
6731,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And by one berry-brown hand;
6732,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And he hath laughed at her and kissed
6733,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Her cheek the sun hath tanned.
6734,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6735,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"“The feud is to the death, sweetheart:"
6736,DEAD MAN’S RUN,But forward must I ride.”--
6737,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"“And if you ride to death, sweetheart,"
6738,DEAD MAN’S RUN,My place is by your side.”
6739,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6740,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Low hath he laughed again and kissed
6741,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And helped her with his hand;
6742,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And they have galloped into the mist
6743,DEAD MAN’S RUN,That belts the autumn land.
6744,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6745,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"And they had passed by Devil’s Den,"
6746,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"And come to Dead Man’s Run,"
6747,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"When in the brush rose up two men,"
6748,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Each with a levelled gun.
6749,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6750,DEAD MAN’S RUN,“Down! down! my sister!” cries the one;--
6751,DEAD MAN’S RUN,She gives the reins a twirl.--
6752,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"The other shouts, “He shot my son!"
6753,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And now he steals my girl!”
6754,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6755,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The rifles crack: she will not wail:
6756,DEAD MAN’S RUN,He will not cease to ride:
6757,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"But, oh! her face is pale, is pale,"
6758,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And the red blood stains her side.
6759,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6760,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"“Sit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart!"
6761,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The road is rough to ride!”--
6762,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"The road is rough by gulch and bluff,"
6763,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And her hair blows wild and wide.
6764,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6765,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"“Sit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart!"
6766,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The bank is steep to ride!”--
6767,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"The bank is steep for a strong man’s leap,"
6768,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And her eyes are staring wide.
6769,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6770,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"“Sit fast, sit fast by me, sweetheart!"
6771,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The Run is swift to ride!”--
6772,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"The Run is swift with mountain drift,"
6773,DEAD MAN’S RUN,And she sways from side to side.
6774,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6775,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"Is it a wash of the yellow moss,"
6776,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"Or drift of the autumn’s gold,"
6777,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The mountain torrent foams across
6778,DEAD MAN’S RUN,For the dead pine’s roots to hold?
6779,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6780,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"Is it the bark of the sycamore,"
6781,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"Or peel of the white birch-tree,"
6782,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The mountaineer on the other shore
6783,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Hath followed and still can see?
6784,DEAD MAN’S RUN,
6785,DEAD MAN’S RUN,"No mountain moss or leaves, wild rolled,"
6786,DEAD MAN’S RUN,No bark of birchen-gray!--
6787,DEAD MAN’S RUN,Young hair of gold and a face death-cold
6788,DEAD MAN’S RUN,The wild stream sweeps away.
6789,DEAD MAN’S RUN,

6839,THE BROTHERS,This unused lane where brambles make
6840,THE BROTHERS,"A wall of twilight, and the blond"
6841,THE BROTHERS,Brier-roses pelt the path and flake
6842,THE BROTHERS,The margin waters of a pond.
6843,THE BROTHERS,
6844,THE BROTHERS,This is its fence--or that which was
6845,THE BROTHERS,"Its fence once--now, rock rolled from rock,"
6846,THE BROTHERS,"One tangle of the vine and dock,"
6847,THE BROTHERS,Where bloom the wild petunias;
6848,THE BROTHERS,"And this its gate, the ragweeds block,"

6852,THE BROTHERS,"The weather-blistered paint, still rise;"
6853,THE BROTHERS,Gaunt things--that groan when some one tries
6854,THE BROTHERS,"The gate whose hinges, rust-congealed,"
6855,THE BROTHERS,Snarl open:--on each post still lies
6856,THE BROTHERS,Its carven panther with a shield.
6857,THE BROTHERS,
6858,THE BROTHERS,We enter; and between great rows
6859,THE BROTHERS,Of locusts winds a grass-grown road;
6860,THE BROTHERS,"And at its glimmering end,--o’erflowed"
6861,THE BROTHERS,"With quiet light,--the white front shows"
6862,THE BROTHERS,"Of an old mansion, grand and broad,"
6863,THE BROTHERS,"With grave, Colonial porticoes."
6864,THE BROTHERS,
6865,THE BROTHERS,"Grown thick around it, dark and deep,"
6866,THE BROTHERS,The locust trees make one vast hush;
6867,THE BROTHERS,Their brawny branches crowd and crush
6868,THE BROTHERS,"Its very casements, and o’ersweep"
6869,THE BROTHERS,Its rotting roofs: their tranquil rush
6870,THE BROTHERS,Haunts all its spacious rooms with sleep.
6871,THE BROTHERS,
6872,THE BROTHERS,Still is it called The Locusts; though
6873,THE BROTHERS,None lives here now. A tale ’s to tell
6874,THE BROTHERS,Of some dark thing that here befell;
6875,THE BROTHERS,"A crime that happened years ago,"
6876,THE BROTHERS,"When past its walls, with shot and shell,"
6877,THE BROTHERS,The war swept on and left it so.
6878,THE BROTHERS,
6879,THE BROTHERS,"For one black night, within it, shame"
6880,THE BROTHERS,"Made revel, while, all here about,"
6881,THE BROTHERS,"With prayer or curse or battle-shout,"
6882,THE BROTHERS,Men died and homesteads leapt in flame:
6883,THE BROTHERS,"Then passed the conquering Northern rout,"
6884,THE BROTHERS,And left it silent and the same.
6885,THE BROTHERS,
6886,THE BROTHERS,Why should I speak of what has been?
6887,THE BROTHERS,Or what dark part I played in all?
6888,THE BROTHERS,Why ruin sits in porch and hall
6889,THE BROTHERS,Where pride and gladness once were seen;
6890,THE BROTHERS,And why beneath this lichened wall
6891,THE BROTHERS,The grave of Margaret is green.
6892,THE BROTHERS,
6893,THE BROTHERS,Heart-broken Margaret! whose fate
6894,THE BROTHERS,Was sadder far than his who won
6895,THE BROTHERS,Her hand--my brother Hamilton--
6896,THE BROTHERS,"Or mine, who learned to know too late;"
6897,THE BROTHERS,"Who learned to know, when all was done,"
6898,THE BROTHERS,And naught I did could expiate.
6899,THE BROTHERS,
6900,THE BROTHERS,To expiate is still my lot!--
6901,THE BROTHERS,"And, like the Ancient Mariner,"
6902,THE BROTHERS,"To show to others how things were,"
6903,THE BROTHERS,"And what I am, still helps me blot"
6904,THE BROTHERS,"A little from that crime’s red blur,"
6905,THE BROTHERS,That on my life is branded hot.
6906,THE BROTHERS,
6907,THE BROTHERS,He was my only brother. She
6908,THE BROTHERS,A sister of my brother’s friend.
6909,THE BROTHERS,"They met, and married in the end."
6910,THE BROTHERS,And I remember well when he
6911,THE BROTHERS,"Brought her rejoicing home, the trend"
6912,THE BROTHERS,Of war moved towards us sullenly.
6913,THE BROTHERS,
6914,THE BROTHERS,And scarce a year of wedlock when
6915,THE BROTHERS,Its red arms tore him from his bride.
6916,THE BROTHERS,With lips by hers thrice sanctified
6917,THE BROTHERS,He left to ride with Morgan’s men.
6918,THE BROTHERS,And I--I never could decide--
6919,THE BROTHERS,Remained behind. It happened then.
6920,THE BROTHERS,
6921,THE BROTHERS,"Long days went by. And, oft delayed,"
6922,THE BROTHERS,A letter came of loving word
6923,THE BROTHERS,"Scrawled by some camp-fire, sabre-stirred,"
6924,THE BROTHERS,"Or by a pine-knot’s fitful aid,"
6925,THE BROTHERS,"When in the saddle, armed and spurred"
6926,THE BROTHERS,And booted for some hurried raid.
6927,THE BROTHERS,
6928,THE BROTHERS,Then weeks went by. I do not know
6929,THE BROTHERS,"How long it was before there came,"
6930,THE BROTHERS,"Blown from the North, the clarion fame"
6931,THE BROTHERS,"Of Morgan, who, with blow on blow,"
6932,THE BROTHERS,Had drawn a line of blood and flame
6933,THE BROTHERS,From Tennessee to Ohio.
6934,THE BROTHERS,
6935,THE BROTHERS,Then letters ceased; and days went on.
6936,THE BROTHERS,"No word from him. The war rolled back,"
6937,THE BROTHERS,And in its turgid crimson track
6938,THE BROTHERS,"A rumor grew, like some wild dawn,"
6939,THE BROTHERS,"All ominous and red and black,"
6940,THE BROTHERS,With news of our lost Hamilton.
6941,THE BROTHERS,
6942,THE BROTHERS,News hinting death or capture. Yet
6943,THE BROTHERS,"No word was sure; till one day,--fed"
6944,THE BROTHERS,"By us,--some men rode up who said"
6945,THE BROTHERS,They’d been with Morgan and had met
6946,THE BROTHERS,"Disaster, and that he was dead,"
6947,THE BROTHERS,My brother.--I and Margaret
6948,THE BROTHERS,
6949,THE BROTHERS,Believed them. Grief was ours too:
6950,THE BROTHERS,But mine was more for her than him:
6951,THE BROTHERS,"Grief, that her eyes with tears were dim:"
6952,THE BROTHERS,"Grief, that became the avenue"
6953,THE BROTHERS,"For love, who crowned the sombre brim"
6954,THE BROTHERS,Of death’s dark cup with rose-red hue.
6955,THE BROTHERS,
6956,THE BROTHERS,"In sympathy,--unconsciously"
6957,THE BROTHERS,"Though it be given,--I hold, doth dwell"
6958,THE BROTHERS,The germ of love that time shall swell
6959,THE BROTHERS,To blossom. Sooner then in me--
6960,THE BROTHERS,When close relations so befell--
6961,THE BROTHERS,That love should spring from sympathy.
6962,THE BROTHERS,
6963,THE BROTHERS,Our similar tastes and mutual bents
6964,THE BROTHERS,Combined to make us intimates
6965,THE BROTHERS,From our first meeting. Different states
6966,THE BROTHERS,Of interest then our temperaments
6967,THE BROTHERS,"Begot. Then friendship, that abates"
6968,THE BROTHERS,"No love, whose soul it represents."
6969,THE BROTHERS,
6970,THE BROTHERS,These led to talks and dreams: how oft
6971,THE BROTHERS,We sat at some wide window while
6972,THE BROTHERS,"The sun sank o’er the hills’ far file,"
6973,THE BROTHERS,Serene; and of the cloud aloft
6974,THE BROTHERS,Made one vast rose; and mile on mile
6975,THE BROTHERS,Of firmament grew sad and soft.
6976,THE BROTHERS,
6977,THE BROTHERS,And all in harmony with these
6978,THE BROTHERS,"Dim clemencies of dusk, afar"
6979,THE BROTHERS,Our talks and dreams went; while the star
6980,THE BROTHERS,Of evening brightened through the trees:
6981,THE BROTHERS,We spoke of home; the end of war;
6982,THE BROTHERS,We dreamed of life and love and peace.
6983,THE BROTHERS,
6984,THE BROTHERS,"How on our walks, in listening lanes"
6985,THE BROTHERS,"Or confidences of the wood,"
6986,THE BROTHERS,We paused to hear the dove that cooed;
6987,THE BROTHERS,"Or gathered wildflowers, taking pains"
6988,THE BROTHERS,To find the fairest; or her hood
6989,THE BROTHERS,Filled with wild fruit that left deep stains.
6990,THE BROTHERS,
6991,THE BROTHERS,"No echo of the drum or fife,"
6992,THE BROTHERS,No hint of conflict entered in
6993,THE BROTHERS,Our thoughts then. Will you call it sin--
6994,THE BROTHERS,Indifference to a nation’s strife?
6995,THE BROTHERS,"What side might lose, what side might win,"
6996,THE BROTHERS,Both immaterial to our life.
6997,THE BROTHERS,
6998,THE BROTHERS,Into the past we did not look:
6999,THE BROTHERS,Beyond what was we did not dream;
7000,THE BROTHERS,While onward rolled the thunderous stream
7001,THE BROTHERS,"Of war, that, in its torrent, took"
7002,THE BROTHERS,One of our own. No crimson gleam
7003,THE BROTHERS,Of its wild course around us shook.
7004,THE BROTHERS,
7005,THE BROTHERS,At last we knew. And when we learned
7006,THE BROTHERS,"How he had fallen, Margaret"
7007,THE BROTHERS,"Wept; and, albeit my eyes were wet,"
7008,THE BROTHERS,Within my soul I half discerned
7009,THE BROTHERS,"A joy that mingled with regret,"
7010,THE BROTHERS,A grief that to relief was turned.
7011,THE BROTHERS,
7012,THE BROTHERS,As time went on and confidence
7013,THE BROTHERS,"Drew us more strongly each to each,"
7014,THE BROTHERS,Why did no intimation reach
7015,THE BROTHERS,Its warning hand into the dense
7016,THE BROTHERS,"Soul-silence, and confuse the speech"
7017,THE BROTHERS,Of love’s unbroken eloquence!
7018,THE BROTHERS,
7019,THE BROTHERS,"But, no! no hint to turn the poise,"
7020,THE BROTHERS,Or check the impulse of our youth;
7021,THE BROTHERS,To chill it with the living truth
7022,THE BROTHERS,As with the awe of God’s own voice;
7023,THE BROTHERS,"No hint, to make our hope uncouth;"
7024,THE BROTHERS,"No word, to warn us from our choice."
7025,THE BROTHERS,
7026,THE BROTHERS,To me a wall seemed overthrown
7027,THE BROTHERS,That social law had raised between;
7028,THE BROTHERS,"And o’er its ruin, broad and green"
7029,THE BROTHERS,"A path went, I possessed alone;"
7030,THE BROTHERS,The sky above seemed all serene;
7031,THE BROTHERS,The land around seemed all my own.
7032,THE BROTHERS,
7033,THE BROTHERS,What shall I say of Margaret
7034,THE BROTHERS,To justify her part in this?
7035,THE BROTHERS,That her young heart was never his?
7036,THE BROTHERS,But had been mine since first we met?
7037,THE BROTHERS,So would you say!--Enough it is
7038,THE BROTHERS,That when he left she loved him yet.
7039,THE BROTHERS,
7040,THE BROTHERS,"So passed the spring, and summer sped;"
7041,THE BROTHERS,And early autumn brought the day
7042,THE BROTHERS,"When she her hand in mine should lay,"
7043,THE BROTHERS,And I should take her hand and wed:
7044,THE BROTHERS,"And still no hint that might gainsay,"
7045,THE BROTHERS,No warning word of quick or dead.
7046,THE BROTHERS,
7047,THE BROTHERS,"The day arrived; and with it born,"
7048,THE BROTHERS,"A battle, sullying the East"
7049,THE BROTHERS,"With boom of cannon, that increased,"
7050,THE BROTHERS,And throb of musket and of horn:
7051,THE BROTHERS,"Until at last, towards dusk, it ceased;"
7052,THE BROTHERS,"And men with faces wild and worn,"
7053,THE BROTHERS,"In fierce retreat, swept past; now groups;"
7054,THE BROTHERS,"Now one by one: now sternly white,"
7055,THE BROTHERS,Or blood-stained; now with looks whose fright
7056,THE BROTHERS,Said all was lost: then sullen troops
7057,THE BROTHERS,"That, beaten, still kept up the fight.--"
7058,THE BROTHERS,Then came the victors: shadowy loops
7059,THE BROTHERS,
7060,THE BROTHERS,"Of men and horse, that left a crowd"
7061,THE BROTHERS,Of officers in hall and porch....
7062,THE BROTHERS,"While through the land, around, the torch"
7063,THE BROTHERS,"Circled, and many a fiery cloud"
7064,THE BROTHERS,Marked out the army’s iron march
7065,THE BROTHERS,"In furrows red that pillage plowed,"
7066,THE BROTHERS,
7067,THE BROTHERS,Here were we wedded.... Ask the years
7068,THE BROTHERS,"How such could be, while over us"
7069,THE BROTHERS,"A sword of wrath swung ominous,"
7070,THE BROTHERS,And on our cheeks its breath struck fierce!--
7071,THE BROTHERS,All I remember is--’t was thus;
7072,THE BROTHERS,And Margaret’s eyes were wet with tears.
7073,THE BROTHERS,
7074,THE BROTHERS,No other cause my memory sees
7075,THE BROTHERS,"Save this, _that_ night was set; and when"
7076,THE BROTHERS,I found my home filled with armed men
7077,THE BROTHERS,With whom were all my sympathies
7078,THE BROTHERS,Of Union--why postpone it then?
7079,THE BROTHERS,So argued conscience into peace.
7080,THE BROTHERS,
7081,THE BROTHERS,"And then it was, when night had passed,"
7082,THE BROTHERS,There came to me an orderly
7083,THE BROTHERS,With word of a Confederate spy
7084,THE BROTHERS,"Just taken; who, with head downcast,"
7085,THE BROTHERS,"Had asked one favor, this: “That I"
7086,THE BROTHERS,Would see him ere he breathed his last.”
7087,THE BROTHERS,
7088,THE BROTHERS,I stand alone here. Heavily
7089,THE BROTHERS,"My thoughts go back. Had I not gone,"
7090,THE BROTHERS,The dead had still been dead! (for none
7091,THE BROTHERS,"Had yet believed his story) he,"
7092,THE BROTHERS,"My dead-deemed brother, Hamilton,"
7093,THE BROTHERS,Who in the spy confronted me.
7094,THE BROTHERS,
7095,THE BROTHERS,"O you who never have been tried,"
7096,THE BROTHERS,How can you judge me!--In my place
7097,THE BROTHERS,"I saw him standing,--who can trace"
7098,THE BROTHERS,"My heart-thoughts then!--I turned aside,"
7099,THE BROTHERS,"A son of some unnatural race,"
7100,THE BROTHERS,And did not speak: and so he died....
7101,THE BROTHERS,
7102,THE BROTHERS,"In hospital or prison, when"
7103,THE BROTHERS,It was he lay; what had forbid
7104,THE BROTHERS,His home return so long: amid
7105,THE BROTHERS,"What hardships he had suffered, then"
7106,THE BROTHERS,"I dared not ask; and when I did,"
7107,THE BROTHERS,"Long afterwards, inquire of men,"
7108,THE BROTHERS,No thing I learned. But this I feel--
7109,THE BROTHERS,He who had so returned to life
7110,THE BROTHERS,"Was not a spy. Through stress and strife,--"
7111,THE BROTHERS,This makes my conscience hard to heal!--
7112,THE BROTHERS,He had escaped: he sought his wife;
7113,THE BROTHERS,He sought his home that should conceal.
7114,THE BROTHERS,
7115,THE BROTHERS,"And Margaret! Oh, pity her!"
7116,THE BROTHERS,"A criminal I sought her side,"
7117,THE BROTHERS,Still thinking love was justified
7118,THE BROTHERS,In all for her--whatever were
7119,THE BROTHERS,"The price: a brother thrice denied,"
7120,THE BROTHERS,Or thrice a brothers murderer.
7121,THE BROTHERS,
7122,THE BROTHERS,Since then long years have passed away.
7123,THE BROTHERS,"And through those years, perhaps, you ’ll ask"
7124,THE BROTHERS,How to the world I wore my mask
7125,THE BROTHERS,Of honesty?--I can but say
7126,THE BROTHERS,Beyond my powers it was a task;
7127,THE BROTHERS,Before my time it turned me gray.
7128,THE BROTHERS,
7129,THE BROTHERS,And when at last the ceaseless hiss
7130,THE BROTHERS,"Of conscience drove, and I betrayed"
7131,THE BROTHERS,"All to her, she knelt down and prayed:"
7132,THE BROTHERS,Then rose: and ’twixt us an abyss
7133,THE BROTHERS,Was opened; and she seemed to fade
7134,THE BROTHERS,Out of my life: I came to miss
7135,THE BROTHERS,The sweet attentions of a bride:
7136,THE BROTHERS,For each appealing heart’s caress
7137,THE BROTHERS,In me her heart assumed a dress
7138,THE BROTHERS,Of dull indifference; till denied
7139,THE BROTHERS,To me was all responsiveness;
7140,THE BROTHERS,And then I knew her love had died.
7141,THE BROTHERS,
7142,THE BROTHERS,"Ah, had she loaded me, perchance,"
7143,THE BROTHERS,"With wild reproach or even hate,"
7144,THE BROTHERS,Such would have helped me hope and wait
7145,THE BROTHERS,Forgiveness and returned romance:
7146,THE BROTHERS,"But ’twixt our souls, instead, a gate"
7147,THE BROTHERS,She closed of silent tolerance.
7148,THE BROTHERS,
7149,THE BROTHERS,"Yet, ’t was for love of her I lent"
7150,THE BROTHERS,My soul to crime.... I question me
7151,THE BROTHERS,"Often, if less entirely"
7152,THE BROTHERS,"I’d loved her, then, in that event"
7153,THE BROTHERS,She had been justified to see
7154,THE BROTHERS,The deed alone stand prominent.
7155,THE BROTHERS,
7156,THE BROTHERS,The deed alone! But love records
7157,THE BROTHERS,"In his own heart, I will aver,"
7158,THE BROTHERS,No depth I did not feel for her
7159,THE BROTHERS,Beyond the plummet-reach of words:
7160,THE BROTHERS,"And though there may be worthier,"
7161,THE BROTHERS,No truer love this world affords
7162,THE BROTHERS,"Than mine was, though it could not rise"
7163,THE BROTHERS,"Above itself. And so ’t was best,"
7164,THE BROTHERS,"Perhaps, that she saw manifest"
7165,THE BROTHERS,"The crime, so I,--as saw her eyes,--"
7166,THE BROTHERS,"Might see; and so, in soul confessed,"
7167,THE BROTHERS,Some life atonement might devise.
7168,THE BROTHERS,
7169,THE BROTHERS,"Sadly my heart one comfort keeps,"
7170,THE BROTHERS,"That, towards her end, she took my hands"
7171,THE BROTHERS,"And said,--as one who understands,--"
7172,THE BROTHERS,“Had I but seen!--But love that weeps
7173,THE BROTHERS,Sees only as its loss commands.”
7174,THE BROTHERS,And sighed.--Beneath this stone she sleeps.
7175,THE BROTHERS,
7176,THE BROTHERS,Yes; I have suffered for that sin:
7177,THE BROTHERS,Yet in no instance would I shun
7178,THE BROTHERS,"What I should suffer. Many a one,"
7179,THE BROTHERS,"Who heard my tale, has tried to win"
7180,THE BROTHERS,Me to believe that Hamilton
7181,THE BROTHERS,"It was not; and, though proven kin,"
7182,THE BROTHERS,
7183,THE BROTHERS,This had not saved him. Still the stain
7184,THE BROTHERS,Of the intention--had I erred
7185,THE BROTHERS,And ’t was not he--had writ the word
7186,THE BROTHERS,Red on my soul that branded Cain:
7187,THE BROTHERS,For still my error had incurred
7188,THE BROTHERS,The fact of guilt that would remain.

7193,THE BROTHERS,And lives with doubt and vain regret;
7194,THE BROTHERS,"And hope and faith, with faces set"
7195,THE BROTHERS,"Upon the past, are never sure;"
7196,THE BROTHERS,"And through their fever, grief, and fret"
7197,THE BROTHERS,The heart may fail that should endure.
7198,THE BROTHERS,
7199,THE BROTHERS,"For in ourselves, however blend"
7200,THE BROTHERS,"The passions that make heaven and hell,"
7201,THE BROTHERS,Is evil not accountable
7202,THE BROTHERS,For most the good we comprehend?
7203,THE BROTHERS,"And through these two,--or ill, or well,--"
7204,THE BROTHERS,Man must evolve his spiritual end.
7205,THE BROTHERS,
7206,THE BROTHERS,It is with deeds that we must ask
7207,THE BROTHERS,"Forgiveness: for, upon this earth,"
7208,THE BROTHERS,Life walks alone from very birth
7209,THE BROTHERS,"With death, hope tells us is a mask"
7210,THE BROTHERS,"For life beyond of vaster worth,"
7211,THE BROTHERS,Where sin no more sets love a task.

7603,UNCERTAINTY,"Mine were the fog, the frosty stalks,"
7604,UNCERTAINTY,"The weak lights on the leafy walks,"
7605,UNCERTAINTY,The shadows shivering with the cold;

7641,LOST LOVE,I loved her so!... Remembering now
7642,LOST LOVE,"My mad grief then, I wonder why"
7643,LOST LOVE,Grief never kills.... I could not die.--
7644,LOST LOVE,She died--I know not how.
7645,LOST LOVE,
7646,LOST LOVE,"Strange, is it not? For she was dear"
7647,LOST LOVE,To me as life once.--A regret

10457,I,A night of rain. The wind is out.
10458,I,And I had wished it otherwise:
10459,I,"A calm, still night; no scudding skies;"
10460,I,"Or, in the scud, above the rout,"
10461,I,The moon; by whose pale light my eyes

10463,I,"To come but will not; lips, that pout"
10464,I,"With seeming anger, all surmise,"
10465,I,When I have said “I love your lies”--
10466,I,Lips I shall kiss before she dies.

10470,II,
10471,II,What force this wind has! As it runs
10472,II,Around each unprotecting tree
10473,II,It seems some beast; and now I see
10474,II,"Its form, its eyes; a woman’s once:--"
10475,II,Dark eyes! that blaze as lionly
10476,II,"As some bayed beast’s, that will not flee"
10477,II,The pine-knots and derides the guns.--
10478,II,Or is it but the thought in me!
10479,II,"The thought of that which is to be,"

10481,II,

10483,III,III
10484,III,
10485,III,And now the trees and whipping rain
10486,III,"Confuse them.... I must drive it hence,"
10487,III,The memory of her eyes! the tense
10488,III,Wild look within them of hard pain!...
10489,III,Yet she must die--with every sense
10490,III,"Strung to beholding knowledge, whence"
10491,III,My heart shall be made whole again.--
10492,III,Here I will wait where night is dense.
10493,III,"Soon she will come, like Innocence,"
10494,III,Thinking her youth is her defense.

10502,IV,"With mossy murmurings its eaves,"
10503,IV,One moment at the iron gate
10504,IV,"She ’ll tarry. Then, with breath abate,"
10505,IV,Come rustling through the autumn leaves.
10506,IV,And I will take both hands and sate
10507,IV,"My mouth on hers and say, “You ’re late”;"
10508,IV,She ’ll laugh to hear I had to wait....

10515,V,The ardor of love’s language you
10516,V,For love’s rose-altar kept alive!
10517,V,Repeat the oaths that rang with dew
10518,V,And starlight!--Tell her she is true
10519,V,As beautiful.--I will contrive
10520,V,To make her think I have no clue
10521,V,To all her falseness. I will woo
10522,V,As once I wooed before I knew.
10523,V,
10524,V,
10525,VI,VI
10526,VI,

10528,VI,The shuffling leaves about our feet;
10529,VI,"Our ruin, as the wood’s, complete,"
10530,VI,Because one woman so hath sinned
10531,VI,And never suffered. She shall meet
10532,VI,No murder in my eyes; no heat
10533,VI,Of fate in holding hand that ’s pinned
10534,VI,"To hers. To make her trust to beat,"
10535,VI,"I ’ll kiss her hand, her hair,--like wheat"
10536,VI,"Of affluent summer,--saying “Sweet.”"
10537,VI,
10538,VI,
10539,VII,VII
10540,VII,
10541,VII,"And should I bungle in this thing,"
10542,VII,This purpose that must see her dead
10543,VII,To cure this fever in my head?--
10544,VII,What other thing is there to bring
10545,VII,Soul satisfaction? when is shed
10546,VII,"No real blood, save what makes red"
10547,VII,The baulked intention?--I will fling
10548,VII,The mask aside!--But hate hath led
10549,VII,Desire too far now to be fed
10550,VII,With failure. I have naught to dread.

10558,VIII,"The giant foam with roar and hiss,"
10559,VIII,I will not cease to coax and be
10560,VIII,The anxious lover. Trusting she
10561,VIII,Will not suspect my farewell kiss
10562,VIII,"Until it turns a curse, and we"
10563,VIII,"Sway for an instant totteringly,"
10564,VIII,And she has shrieked some prayer at me.

10566,VIII,
10567,IX,IX
10568,IX,
10569,IX,O let me see wild terror there
10570,IX,Upon her face! the wilder frown
10571,IX,"Of crime’s apprisal, and renown"
10572,IX,"Of my life’s injury, that bare"
10573,IX,This horror with its bloody crown!--
10574,IX,"No pity, God! For, if her gown,"
10575,IX,"Suspending looseness of her hair,"
10576,IX,Delay the plunge ... the night is brown ...
10577,IX,"My heel must crush her white face down,"

10585,THE PARTING,
10586,THE PARTING,"She passed the thorn-trees, whose gaunt branches tossed"
10587,THE PARTING,"Their spider-shadows round her; and the breeze,"
10588,THE PARTING,"Beneath the ashen moon, was full of frost,"
10589,THE PARTING,"And mouthed and mumbled in the sickly trees,"
10590,THE PARTING,Like some starved hag who sees her children freeze.
10591,THE PARTING,
10592,THE PARTING,Dry-eyed she waited by the sycamore.
10593,THE PARTING,Some stars made misty blotches in the sky.
10594,THE PARTING,And all the wretched willows on the shore
10595,THE PARTING,Looked faded as a jaundiced cheek or eye.
10596,THE PARTING,She felt deep sorrow yet could only sigh.
10597,THE PARTING,
10598,THE PARTING,She heard his skiff grind on the river rocks
10599,THE PARTING,Whistling he came into the shadow made
10600,THE PARTING,By the great tree. He kissed her on her locks;
10601,THE PARTING,And round her form his eager arms were laid.
10602,THE PARTING,Passive she stood her purpose unbetrayed.
10603,THE PARTING,
10604,THE PARTING,"And then she spoke, while still his greeting kiss"
10605,THE PARTING,Stung in her hair. She did not dare to lift
10606,THE PARTING,Her face to his; her anguished eyes to his
10607,THE PARTING,While tears smote crystal in her throat. One rift
10608,THE PARTING,Of weakness humored might set all adrift.
10609,THE PARTING,
10610,THE PARTING,Anger and shame were his. She meekly heard.
10611,THE PARTING,"And then the oar-locks sounded, and her brain"
10612,THE PARTING,Remembered he had said no farewell word;
10613,THE PARTING,And swift emotion swept her; and again
10614,THE PARTING,Left her as silent as a carven pain....
10615,THE PARTING,
10616,THE PARTING,"She, in the old sad farm-house, wearily"
10617,THE PARTING,"Resumed the drudgery of her common lot,"

10661,THE DAUGHTER OF THE SNOW,With his icy-armored leaders;

10813,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Frozen; some of topaz-glister,"
10814,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Vinous; in whose blinding middle
10815,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Blazed an orb of burning bisque.
10816,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10817,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"And I saw where, silvery slanted,"
10818,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,A vast pyramidic heap
10819,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Rose of spar; whereon was planted
10820,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"The acropolis of Sleep,--"
10821,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"God of these:--that, looming higher,"
10822,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Wrought of seeming ice and fire,"
10823,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Where pale rainbow-colors panted,"
10824,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Gleamed above the lunar deep.
10825,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10826,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Robed in white simarre and chiton,"
10827,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Visions filled its every square,"

10832,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Radiance went, that shadowed white, on"
10833,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Temple and on palace stair.
10834,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10835,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Though they called me, I descended"
10836,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Earthward. For great longing drew
10837,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Me and, drawing me, was blended"
10838,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,With your world. I never knew
10839,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"It was Earth, until,--forsaking"
10840,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Heaven,--I beheld it taking,--"
10841,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"A great azure sphere,--its splendid"
10842,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Way along the singing blue.
10843,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10844,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"And when night came, here, above you,--"
10845,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Sleeping by your folded sheep
10846,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"On the hills,--I stooped: whereof you"
10847,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Dreamed: I kissed you in your sleep:
10848,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"I, your destiny, who wrought it"
10849,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"So you knew me: you, who thought it"
10850,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Not so strange that I should love you,"
10851,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,I a spirit of the deep.
10852,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10853,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"’Twas your love that sought and found me,"
10854,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Drew me from that star-life sad;
10855,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Won my soul to yours and bound me
10856,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,With such love as none hath had:
10857,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"I am she, you may remember,"
10858,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,That fair star that seemed an ember
10859,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"O’er you, that you loved.--Around me"
10860,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Wrap your arms now and be glad.
10861,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,
10862,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Look above: what seems a petal,"
10863,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Burning, of a rose; that far"
10864,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Point of radiance, bright as metal,"
10865,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Fiery silver, is your star!"
10866,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Look above you: rise unto it.
10867,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,Let it lead you now who drew it
10868,THE SPIRIT OF THE STAR,"Down to Earth, where shadows settle!--"

10941,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"I saw, midmost the Van, a feathering fire"
10942,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Dilating ivory-wan.--Expectant night
10943,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Tiptoed attentive, fearful to suspire.--"
10944,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Wherefrom arose--what white divinity?
10945,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,What godhead sensed with glory and desire?
10946,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Born for the moment for the eyes of me!
10947,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Then re-absorbed into the brassy gloom
10948,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Of whispering waves that sighed their ecstasy.
10949,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Thou! in whose path harmonious colors bloom,"

10953,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"He is not dead and yet it seems he is,"
10954,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Since all his soul with spirit-rapture glows.--
10955,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,O sylph-like brow! lips like an angel’s kiss!
10956,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,High immortality! whose face was such
10957,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,As starlight in a lily’s loveliness!...
10958,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,The gold that bound thee seemed too base to clutch
10959,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Thy chastity, though clear as golden gum"
10960,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"That almugs sweat, and fragrance to the touch!"
10961,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Thy hair--not hair!--seemed rays, like those that come"
10962,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Strained through the bubble of a chrysolite.--
10963,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,No word I said: thy beauty struck me dumb.
10964,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Thy face, that is upon my soul’s quick sight"
10965,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Eternal seared, hath made of me a shade,"
10966,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,A wandering shadow of the day and night:
10967,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"A seeker ’mid the hoary hills for aid,"
10968,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"The sole society of my sick heart, who"
10969,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Shuns all companionship of man and maid:
10970,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Who, comrade of the mountain blossoms blue,"
10971,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"And intimate of old trees, goes dreaming they,--"
10972,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,As in that legendary world that drew
10973,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Oracles from lips in oaks--, may sometime say"
10974,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Prophetic precepts to it: how were won
10975,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"A spirit loved to love a mortal;--yea,"
10976,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,In vain.--
10977,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"But one day, frog-like in the sun,"
10978,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Beside a cave,--the nightshade vines made rank"
10979,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"And hairy henbane, where huge spiders spun,--"

10981,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Squat something startled, naught save skin and hair;"
10982,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"With eyes wherein dwelt demons; flames, that shrank"
10983,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"And grew;--familiars, who fixed me with glare"
10984,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"As, raising claw-like hands when I drew near,"
10985,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Frog-like he croaked, “Thou fool! go seek her there!"
10986,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Woo her with thy heart’s actions! making clear
10987,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Thy soul’s white passage for her coming feet!--
10988,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,In! in! thou fool! plunge in! Fear naught but fear!”
10989,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,
10990,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Yet I have waited many weeks. Repeat.
10991,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Acts of the heart with passionate offering
10992,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Of love whose anguish makes it seven times sweet.

10994,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"My self alone; my soul unfearing, see!"
10995,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,My soul unto thee!--Shall the clay still cling
10996,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Clogging fulfillment? and achievement be
10997,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Balked still by flesh?--no! let me in--to die,"
10998,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Haply; or, for a moment’s mystery,"
10999,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Gaze in thine eyes: one splendid instant lie
11000,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"In thy white arms and bosom; and thy kiss,"
11001,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,My elemental immortality!--
11002,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Part of thy breathing waves, to laugh or hiss"
11003,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"In foam; or winds, that rock the awful deeps,"
11004,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Or build with song vast temples for thy bliss.
11005,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Wherein, responsive as thy white hand sweeps"
11006,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"The chords of some sad shell, I’ll dream and roam"
11007,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,Through glaucous chambers where the green day sleeps.
11008,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Dead not with death, what secrets hath thy home"
11009,THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN,"Not mine then, epoched in exultant foam?..."

11154,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Vast, a fountain: where he saw"
11155,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Limbs of light without a flaw;
11156,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Breasts and arms of bloom; that waited
11157,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,For his soul to nearer draw.
11158,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,
11159,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Houri faces shimmered there;
11160,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Fluid forms.--It, with a thunder"
11161,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Of wild music, like the hair"
11162,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Of a genie, flamed from under"
11163,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Caverns of the demon-world:
11164,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Filled with voices, high it hurled,"
11165,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Calling him, with beckoning wonder"
11166,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Of cœrulean forms that swirled.
11167,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,
11168,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,And with burning lips and eyes
11169,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"In he plunged: hoarse laughter greeted,"
11170,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Demon laughter: then sad sighs,"
11171,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Dying downward: passion-heated
11172,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Hands seemed drawing him away,"
11173,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Downward: where a rocking ray
11174,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Flamed and swung, and Eblis-sheeted"
11175,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Shadows wandered ghostly gray.

11181,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"Anguish-throated bulbuls sung,"
11182,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"In the silent starlight starting,"
11183,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"One, a Baghdad merchant, led"
11184,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,"By the hoarness of its head,"
11185,THE CAVERNS OF KAF,Found what seemed a mummy: parting

11202,THE SALAMANDER,
11203,THE SALAMANDER,"Once she breathed upon my eyes,"
11204,THE SALAMANDER,Touched the soul that dreamed within me;
11205,THE SALAMANDER,All the magic that might win me

11221,THE SALAMANDER,And most awful beauty! nor
11222,THE SALAMANDER,"Actual, nor yet ideal!--"
11223,THE SALAMANDER,Insubstantial and yet real;
11224,THE SALAMANDER,"Partly flame and partly star,"
11225,THE SALAMANDER,Yet no part of what these are.
11226,THE SALAMANDER,
11227,THE SALAMANDER,I am hers and--woe is mine!...
11228,THE SALAMANDER,Has she drugged me with the sadness
11229,THE SALAMANDER,Of some elemental madness?--
11230,THE SALAMANDER,Like a demigod I pine
11231,THE SALAMANDER,’Twixt the mortal and divine....
11232,THE SALAMANDER,
11233,THE SALAMANDER,"When I see her, lo, she stands"
11234,THE SALAMANDER,In the luminous electre
11235,THE SALAMANDER,Of a star: a smiling spectre
11236,THE SALAMANDER,With white scintillating hands
11237,THE SALAMANDER,Luring to unhallowed lands.
11238,THE SALAMANDER,
11239,THE SALAMANDER,"Then, behold, in fearful file,"
11240,THE SALAMANDER,"A mirage of tower and terrace,"
11241,THE SALAMANDER,"Lawn and mountain range,--that buries"
11242,THE SALAMANDER,"Flame in frost,--looms! mile on mile"
11243,THE SALAMANDER,Of her crescent-glowing Isle:
11244,THE SALAMANDER,
11245,THE SALAMANDER,Where the lurid waters lull
11246,THE SALAMANDER,Shores that roll the rainbow fire;
11247,THE SALAMANDER,"Where, with living lute and lyre,"
11248,THE SALAMANDER,"Rose-red, swiftly as a gull,"
11249,THE SALAMANDER,Glides her star-like galley’s hull.
11250,THE SALAMANDER,
11251,THE SALAMANDER,"And, behold, before I know,"
11252,THE SALAMANDER,"I am where her walls of amber,"
11253,THE SALAMANDER,"Towers of limpid ruby, clamber"
11254,THE SALAMANDER,Over terraces below

11256,THE SALAMANDER,
11257,THE SALAMANDER,Lambent lazuli and shell
11258,THE SALAMANDER,Colonnade her courts of marble;

11262,THE SALAMANDER,
11263,THE SALAMANDER,"Rosy silver seems her skin,"
11264,THE SALAMANDER,"And a flame her arm commanding,"
11265,THE SALAMANDER,"With its gleaming hand, me, standing"
11266,THE SALAMANDER,"At her gates, to enter in,"
11267,THE SALAMANDER,Burning as a Seraphin.
11268,THE SALAMANDER,
11269,THE SALAMANDER,"Lucid darkness are her eyes,"
11270,THE SALAMANDER,Where the frozen fire smolders;
11271,THE SALAMANDER,"And upon her shining shoulders,"
11272,THE SALAMANDER,"Like a tangible glitter, lies"
11273,THE SALAMANDER,Auburn hair like sunset skies.
11274,THE SALAMANDER,
11275,THE SALAMANDER,Mouth of sibilant soft flame;
11276,THE SALAMANDER,"Lilith lips, whose roses lighten"
11277,THE SALAMANDER,With illusive love; and brighten
11278,THE SALAMANDER,With wild passion and the name
11279,THE SALAMANDER,Of desire no man may tame.
11280,THE SALAMANDER,
11281,THE SALAMANDER,"Passion, and the thoughts that wed"
11282,THE SALAMANDER,Love and loathing; such caresses
11283,THE SALAMANDER,Of sweet touch as naught expresses
11284,THE SALAMANDER,"Here on Earth, yet full of dread,"
11285,THE SALAMANDER,"Madness, whereof death is bred."
11286,THE SALAMANDER,
11287,THE SALAMANDER,She hath drawn me to her lips;
11288,THE SALAMANDER,Borne me through her palace portal;
11289,THE SALAMANDER,"And the fire, which is immortal,"
11290,THE SALAMANDER,From me like a garment slips--
11291,THE SALAMANDER,"Ah, the spirit-part’s eclipse!"
11292,THE SALAMANDER,
11293,THE SALAMANDER,As when moon and planet swoon
11294,THE SALAMANDER,"Unto each, my body kindles,"
11295,THE SALAMANDER,"Strangely, while my spirit dwindles,"
11296,THE SALAMANDER,"Like the Earth-o’ershadowed moon,"
11297,THE SALAMANDER,Darkening from lune to lune.
11298,THE SALAMANDER,
11299,THE SALAMANDER,Then she laughs; and leads me where
11300,THE SALAMANDER,"Cloudy, wild, chameleon color"
11301,THE SALAMANDER,"Marbles halls with hues, the duller"
11302,THE SALAMANDER,"For her astral presence there,"
11303,THE SALAMANDER,Beaming white with beaming hair:
11304,THE SALAMANDER,
11305,THE SALAMANDER,"Where, in roses purple pale,--"
11306,THE SALAMANDER,Dropping like a ruby bubble
11307,THE SALAMANDER,"Through the moon dust,--“double double,”"
11308,THE SALAMANDER,"Throbs the crimson nightingale,"
11309,THE SALAMANDER,There she lures me with some tale.
11310,THE SALAMANDER,
11311,THE SALAMANDER,Or to where the scarlet snake
11312,THE SALAMANDER,Coils beneath great flaming flowers;
11313,THE SALAMANDER,Where the musk mimosa bowers
11314,THE SALAMANDER,"Roll their rosy clouds, and make"
11315,THE SALAMANDER,Sunset heavens of each lake.
11316,THE SALAMANDER,
11317,THE SALAMANDER,"Where the bees and moths go by,"
11318,THE SALAMANDER,Fiery diamond; opal-burning
11319,THE SALAMANDER,"Butterflies, and iris-turning"
11320,THE SALAMANDER,"Peacock-painted birds, that vie"
11321,THE SALAMANDER,"With the flow’rs, like fragments fly"
11322,THE SALAMANDER,"Of wild rainbow: Where, in rills,"
11323,THE SALAMANDER,"Down the rocks, that lichens redden,"
11324,THE SALAMANDER,Constellated moss and leaden
11325,THE SALAMANDER,"Fungus glow; and all the hills,"
11326,THE SALAMANDER,"As with flames, the orchid fills."
11327,THE SALAMANDER,
11328,THE SALAMANDER,"Where, in coruscating light,"
11329,THE SALAMANDER,Glare the golden-checkered zinnias;
11330,THE SALAMANDER,"And the bugle-bloomed gloxinias,"
11331,THE SALAMANDER,"Making morning of each height,"
11332,THE SALAMANDER,Float like mists of ruby white.
11333,THE SALAMANDER,
11334,THE SALAMANDER,"There, beneath some blazing vine,"
11335,THE SALAMANDER,Where the liquid moonlight glitters
11336,THE SALAMANDER,"Of a river,--coral litters"
11337,THE SALAMANDER,"Red with grail,--like prisms in wine"
11338,THE SALAMANDER,I have watched the fishes shine.
11339,THE SALAMANDER,
11340,THE SALAMANDER,"Or, o’er sunset-colored moss,"
11341,THE SALAMANDER,Glow-worms trail their beryls; sprinkling
11342,THE SALAMANDER,"Green the smouldering shade; while, twinkling,"
11343,THE SALAMANDER,"With convulsive sapphire gloss,"
11344,THE SALAMANDER,Fireflies rained blue lights across.
11345,THE SALAMANDER,
11346,THE SALAMANDER,"Where the reeds seemed rays of rose,"
11347,THE SALAMANDER,"And white mirrored moons, the lotus--"
11348,THE SALAMANDER,Each a spirit giving notice
11349,THE SALAMANDER,Of the inner light that glows
11350,THE SALAMANDER,Where the under water flows--
11351,THE SALAMANDER,
11352,THE SALAMANDER,Shapes arose of flashing spray:--
11353,THE SALAMANDER,"Where, a wild auroral splendor,"
11354,THE SALAMANDER,"Rolled the forest,--emerald-tender"
11355,THE SALAMANDER,"As the light of breaking day,--"
11356,THE SALAMANDER,Beckoned forms of starry ray.
11357,THE SALAMANDER,
11358,THE SALAMANDER,"Through the violetish light,"
11359,THE SALAMANDER,Winged with nautilus and lily
11360,THE SALAMANDER,"Flame, adown the forests stilly"
11361,THE SALAMANDER,"Vistas, moony whirls of white,"
11362,THE SALAMANDER,Floated shapes with eyes of night.
11363,THE SALAMANDER,
11364,THE SALAMANDER,I must follow where she leads.--
11365,THE SALAMANDER,Blinding portals of her castle
11366,THE SALAMANDER,To my entering feet are facile....
11367,THE SALAMANDER,Love no terrible trumpet needs
11368,THE SALAMANDER,At her gates to bugle deeds....
11369,THE SALAMANDER,
11370,THE SALAMANDER,"Lo, my being never veils"
11371,THE SALAMANDER,Aught from her. To her caresses
11372,THE SALAMANDER,All my heart knows it confesses
11373,THE SALAMANDER,"With a faith that never fails,"
11374,THE SALAMANDER,Though it hears the truth that wails
11375,THE SALAMANDER,"In its soul’s admonishment,"
11376,THE SALAMANDER,Of the curse that sits in session
11377,THE SALAMANDER,In each amorous expression
11378,THE SALAMANDER,Of her love; its violent
11379,THE SALAMANDER,"Flame, by which my life is rent."
11380,THE SALAMANDER,
11381,THE SALAMANDER,I have drained the feverish cup
11382,THE SALAMANDER,Of all darkness. Made a leman
11383,THE SALAMANDER,Of an elemental demon;
11384,THE SALAMANDER,"And my soul lies, staring up,"
11385,THE SALAMANDER,Draining poison at each sup.--
11386,THE SALAMANDER,
11387,THE SALAMANDER,While she smiles on me ’tis well:
11388,THE SALAMANDER,"I shall follow, though she make me"
11389,THE SALAMANDER,What her self is; never wake me
11390,THE SALAMANDER,"From the dream I can not tell,"
11391,THE SALAMANDER,That is neither heaven nor hell:
11392,THE SALAMANDER,
11393,THE SALAMANDER,Where I drink mesmeric gold
11394,THE SALAMANDER,"Of wild vision,--that romances"
11395,THE SALAMANDER,In informing Protean fancies
11396,THE SALAMANDER,"With a beauty never old,"
11397,THE SALAMANDER,And emotion never cold.--
11398,THE SALAMANDER,
11399,THE SALAMANDER,Let me drink and never wake
11400,THE SALAMANDER,From the trances that environ
11401,THE SALAMANDER,"Me, and ’neath the subtle siren"
11402,THE SALAMANDER,"See the demon, like a snake,"
11403,THE SALAMANDER,With destroying eyes that ache.
11404,THE SALAMANDER,
11405,THE SALAMANDER,While the slow laconic look
11406,THE SALAMANDER,"Of her eyes express no censure,"
11407,THE SALAMANDER,"Gazing in them, I adventure,--"
11408,THE SALAMANDER,"Far beyond the wisest book,--"
11409,THE SALAMANDER,Ways her serpent fancy took.
11410,THE SALAMANDER,
11411,THE SALAMANDER,Yet I know I reverence
11412,THE SALAMANDER,One whose gaze in God’s negation;
11413,THE SALAMANDER,"One who, like an emanation"
11414,THE SALAMANDER,"Of all evil, chains my sense"
11415,THE SALAMANDER,With satanic influence.
11416,THE SALAMANDER,
11417,THE SALAMANDER,"Yet, while still I hear her say,"
11418,THE SALAMANDER,“One more kiss before the morning!
11419,THE SALAMANDER,One more bliss for love’s adorning!
11420,THE SALAMANDER,"One more kiss ere break of day,”"
11421,THE SALAMANDER,Still my soul with her must stay.
11422,THE SALAMANDER,
11423,THE SALAMANDER,"Stay, nor know, nor ever see!"
11424,THE SALAMANDER,"Till her basilisk beauty flashes,"
11425,THE SALAMANDER,"And the curse, from out the ashes"
11426,THE SALAMANDER,"Of her passion, fiery,"
11427,THE SALAMANDER,Strikes--destroying utterly.

11452,LYANNA.,
11453,LYANNA.,"Self-exiled so from the sylphs that cluster,"
11454,LYANNA.,"Pulsing with pearl and burning with blue,"

11462,LYANNA.,"For Summer murmured me, “Follow! follow!”"
11463,LYANNA.,Whispered one word that was all of love.--
11464,LYANNA.,"Winged with the speed of the sweeping swallow,"
11465,LYANNA.,I followed the word she had breathed above:
11466,LYANNA.,“Follow! follow!”--the god Apollo

11471,LYANNA.,"Fleet as the winds are fleet, yea, and fleeter"

11473,LYANNA.,"Through the firmament’s blue, in musical metre"

11480,LYANNA.,Thus to the north my wings went maying

11507,LYANNA.,"“Lyanna, I hoop thee with arms of fire!”--"

11524,LYANNA.,
11525,LYANNA.,"Lo, as I spoke, with thoughts that thicken,"

11537,LYANNA.,Brighter and burning blue.
11538,LYANNA.,"And my heart was thine, though it held thee slighter"
11539,LYANNA.,Than hues that the mists of the morning take:
11540,LYANNA.,"And waited and yearned, and the yearning tighter"
11541,LYANNA.,Than tears in the hearts that break.
11542,LYANNA.,
11543,LYANNA.,“‘Lyanna! Lyanna!’ I heard thee ever
11544,LYANNA.,"Calling ‘Lyanna,’ a ripple of flame:"
11545,LYANNA.,‘Lyanna! Lyanna!’ like song forever;
11546,LYANNA.,And I marveled at my name.
11547,LYANNA.,The sound was such--that if stars could sever
11548,LYANNA.,"And silver-syllable a word of beams,"
11549,LYANNA.,So would it sound.--I turned; but never
11550,LYANNA.,"Beheld thee, only in dreams."
11551,LYANNA.,
11552,LYANNA.,“Thou walkedst a beauty afar: a glitter
11553,LYANNA.,"Of gleaming aroma: and I, with moan,"
11554,LYANNA.,"Reached thee my arms: but thy gaze was bitter,"
11555,LYANNA.,Calmer and sterner than stone:
11556,LYANNA.,"Avoiding thou passedst in scorn: a sitter,"
11557,LYANNA.,"I seemed, on the uttermost bounds of bliss:"
11558,LYANNA.,"When, lo! on the wind,--a flame, a flitter"
11559,LYANNA.,"Of fire,--thy laugh, and thy kiss!”--"
11560,LYANNA.,
11561,LYANNA.,"I had won her love. And, behold! the thunder"
11562,LYANNA.,Trumpeted tempest: I heard the seas
11563,LYANNA.,"Lunge at the walls like a roaring wonder,"
11564,LYANNA.,And the rain-wind sing in the trees.--
11565,LYANNA.,Lyanna my bride.--And the heavens asunder
11566,LYANNA.,"Rushed--chasms of glaring storm, where poured"
11567,LYANNA.,"The thunder’s cataracts, rolling under--"
11568,LYANNA.,"And showed me, horde on horde,"
11569,LYANNA.,
11570,LYANNA.,The shouting spirits of storm.--The portal
11571,LYANNA.,"Of sleep was riven; she rose, and saw:"
11572,LYANNA.,"And I said to her soul, “Of the utterly mortal"
11573,LYANNA.,Mine the eternal lot and law.”--
11574,LYANNA.,"“I love thee!” she answered.--And I, “Immortal"
11575,LYANNA.,Am I through thy love!” ... And so we fled....
11576,LYANNA.,"Behold! when they came in the morn, astartle,"
11577,LYANNA.,Men whispered--“Lyanna is dead!”

11592,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Mist-like from her monster womb,"

11612,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Clove a sound, like the notes of a harper:"
11613,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Clove a sound, and the horrors grew"

11615,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"With whirlwinds of blackness that blew,"
11616,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,And storm that was godly in might.
11617,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,And the walls of our dungeon were shattered
11618,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,Like the crust of a fire-wrecked world:
11619,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"As torrents of clouds that are scattered,"

11705,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Song and the bursting buds,"

11712,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Darkness is rent in two,"
11713,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,Conquered and strown.

11716,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,_Voices of the Dawn_
11717,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,
11718,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,Ye in your darkness are
11719,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,Dark and infernal;
11720,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,Subject to death and mar!
11721,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"But in the spaces far,"
11722,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,"Like our effulgent star,"
11723,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,We are eternal.

11725,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,
11726,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,
11727,THE SPIRITS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS,
11728,THE WATER WITCH,THE WATER WITCH
11729,THE WATER WITCH,
11730,THE WATER WITCH,
11731,THE WATER WITCH,See! the milk-white doe is wounded.
11732,THE WATER WITCH,He will follow as it bounds
11733,THE WATER WITCH,"Through the woods. His horn has sounded,"
11734,THE WATER WITCH,"Echoing, for his men and hounds."
11735,THE WATER WITCH,But no answering bugle blew.
11736,THE WATER WITCH,He has lost his retinue
11737,THE WATER WITCH,For the shapely deer that bounded
11738,THE WATER WITCH,Past him when his bow he drew.
11739,THE WATER WITCH,
11740,THE WATER WITCH,Not one hound or huntsman follows.
11741,THE WATER WITCH,Through the underbrush and moss
11742,THE WATER WITCH,Goes the slot; and in the hollows
11743,THE WATER WITCH,"Of the hills, that he must cross,"
11744,THE WATER WITCH,He has lost it. He must fare
11745,THE WATER WITCH,Over rocks where she-wolves lair;
11746,THE WATER WITCH,Wood-pools where the wild-boar wallows:
11747,THE WATER WITCH,So he leaves his hunter there.
11748,THE WATER WITCH,
11749,THE WATER WITCH,Through his mind then flashed an olden
11750,THE WATER WITCH,Legend told him by the monks:--
11751,THE WATER WITCH,"Of a girl, whose hair is golden,"
11752,THE WATER WITCH,Haunting fountains and the trunks
11753,THE WATER WITCH,"Of the woodlands; who, they say,"
11754,THE WATER WITCH,"Is a white doe all the day,"
11755,THE WATER WITCH,But when woods are night-enfolden
11756,THE WATER WITCH,Turns into an evil fay.
11757,THE WATER WITCH,
11758,THE WATER WITCH,Then the story once his teacher
11759,THE WATER WITCH,Told him: of a mountain lake
11760,THE WATER WITCH,"Demons dwell in; vague of feature,"
11761,THE WATER WITCH,"Human-like; but each a snake,"
11762,THE WATER WITCH,She is queen of.--Did he hear
11763,THE WATER WITCH,Laughter at his startled ear?
11764,THE WATER WITCH,"Or a bird?--And now, what creature"
11765,THE WATER WITCH,"Is it,--or the wind,--stirs near?"
11766,THE WATER WITCH,
11767,THE WATER WITCH,"Fever of the hunt! This water,"
11768,THE WATER WITCH,"Falling here, will cool his head."
11769,THE WATER WITCH,"Through the forest, dyed in slaughter,"
11770,THE WATER WITCH,Slants the sunset; ruby-red
11771,THE WATER WITCH,Are the drops that slip between
11772,THE WATER WITCH,"Hollowed hands, while on the green,--"
11773,THE WATER WITCH,Like the couch of some wild daughter
11774,THE WATER WITCH,"Of the forest,--he doth lean."
11775,THE WATER WITCH,
11776,THE WATER WITCH,"But the runnel, bubbling, dripping,"
11777,THE WATER WITCH,Seems to bid him to be gone;
11778,THE WATER WITCH,As with crystal words and tripping
11779,THE WATER WITCH,Steps of sparkle luring on.
11780,THE WATER WITCH,Now a spirit in the rocks
11781,THE WATER WITCH,"Calls him; now a face that mocks,"
11782,THE WATER WITCH,"From behind some boulder slipping,"
11783,THE WATER WITCH,Laughs at him through lilied locks.
11784,THE WATER WITCH,
11785,THE WATER WITCH,"And he follows through the flowers,"
11786,THE WATER WITCH,"Blue and gold, that blossom there;"
11787,THE WATER WITCH,Thridding twilight-haunted bowers
11788,THE WATER WITCH,Where each ripple seems the bare
11789,THE WATER WITCH,Beauty of white limbs that gleam
11790,THE WATER WITCH,Rosy through the running stream;
11791,THE WATER WITCH,"Or bright-shaken hair, that showers"
11792,THE WATER WITCH,Starlight in the sunset’s beam.
11793,THE WATER WITCH,
11794,THE WATER WITCH,"Till, far in the forest, sleeping"
11795,THE WATER WITCH,"Like a luminous darkness, lay"
11796,THE WATER WITCH,"A deep water, wherein, leaping,"
11797,THE WATER WITCH,"Fell the Fountain of the Fay,"
11798,THE WATER WITCH,"With a singing, sighing sound,"
11799,THE WATER WITCH,"As of spirit things around,"
11800,THE WATER WITCH,"Musically laughing, weeping"
11801,THE WATER WITCH,In the air and underground.
11802,THE WATER WITCH,
11803,THE WATER WITCH,Not a ripple o’er it merried:
11804,THE WATER WITCH,"Like the round moon in a cloud,"
11805,THE WATER WITCH,In its rocks the lake lay buried:
11806,THE WATER WITCH,And strange creatures seemed to crowd
11807,THE WATER WITCH,Its dark depths: dim limbs and eyes
11808,THE WATER WITCH,To the surface seemed to rise
11809,THE WATER WITCH,"Spawn-like; or, all formless, ferried"
11810,THE WATER WITCH,Through the water shadow-wise.
11811,THE WATER WITCH,
11812,THE WATER WITCH,"Foliage things with woman faces,"
11813,THE WATER WITCH,"Demon-dreadful, pale and wild"
11814,THE WATER WITCH,As the forms the lightning traces
11815,THE WATER WITCH,On the clouds the storm has piled
11816,THE WATER WITCH,In the darkness.--On the strand--
11817,THE WATER WITCH,What is that which now doth stand?--
11818,THE WATER WITCH,’Tis a woman: and she places
11819,THE WATER WITCH,On his arm a spray-white hand.
11820,THE WATER WITCH,
11821,THE WATER WITCH,Ah! two mystic worlds of sorrow
11822,THE WATER WITCH,"Were her eyes; her hair, a place"
11823,THE WATER WITCH,Whence the moon its gold might borrow;
11824,THE WATER WITCH,And a dream of ice her face:
11825,THE WATER WITCH,Round her hair and throat in rims
11826,THE WATER WITCH,Pearls of foam hung; and through whims
11827,THE WATER WITCH,"Of her robe, as breaks the morrow,"
11828,THE WATER WITCH,Gleamed the rose-light of her limbs.
11829,THE WATER WITCH,
11830,THE WATER WITCH,Who could help but gaze with gladness
11831,THE WATER WITCH,"On such beauty? though within,"
11832,THE WATER WITCH,Deep within the beryl sadness
11833,THE WATER WITCH,"Of those eyes, the serpent sin"
11834,THE WATER WITCH,Seemed to coil.--She placed her cheek
11835,THE WATER WITCH,"Chilly upon his, and weak"
11836,THE WATER WITCH,With love-longing and its madness
11837,THE WATER WITCH,Grew he. Then he heard her speak:--
11838,THE WATER WITCH,
11839,THE WATER WITCH,“Dost thou love me?”--“If surrender
11840,THE WATER WITCH,"Of the soul means love, I love.”"
11841,THE WATER WITCH,“Dost not fear me?”--“Fear?--more slender
11842,THE WATER WITCH,Art thou than a wildwood dove.
11843,THE WATER WITCH,Yet I fear--I fear to lose
11844,THE WATER WITCH,"Thee, thy love.”--“And thou dost choose"
11845,THE WATER WITCH,Aye to be my heart’s defender?”--
11846,THE WATER WITCH,“Take me. I am thine to use.”
11847,THE WATER WITCH,
11848,THE WATER WITCH,"“Follow then.--Ah, love, no lowly"
11849,THE WATER WITCH,Home I give thee.”--With fixed eyes
11850,THE WATER WITCH,To the water’s edge she slowly
11851,THE WATER WITCH,Drew him.... Nor did he surmise
11852,THE WATER WITCH,"Who this creature was, until"
11853,THE WATER WITCH,"O’er his face the foam closed chill,"
11854,THE WATER WITCH,"Whispering, and the lake unholy"
11855,THE WATER WITCH,"Rippled, rippled and was still."
11856,THE WATER WITCH,
11857,THE WATER WITCH,
11858,THE WATER WITCH,
11859,THE WATER WITCH,
11860,THE SUCCUBA,THE SUCCUBA
11861,THE SUCCUBA,
11862,THE SUCCUBA,
11863,THE SUCCUBA,I have dreams where I believe
11864,THE SUCCUBA,"That a queen of some dim palace,"
11865,THE SUCCUBA,"One, whose name is Genevieve,"
11866,THE SUCCUBA,Weighs me with her love or malice:
11867,THE SUCCUBA,She is dead and yet my bride:
11868,THE SUCCUBA,And she glimmers at my side
11869,THE SUCCUBA,Offering a crystal chalice
11870,THE SUCCUBA,"Filled with fire, diamond-dyed."
11871,THE SUCCUBA,
11872,THE SUCCUBA,"I have dreams. Ah, would that I"
11873,THE SUCCUBA,Might forget them!--I remember
11874,THE SUCCUBA,"How her gaze, all icily"
11875,THE SUCCUBA,"Draws me, like a glowing ember,"
11876,THE SUCCUBA,Up her castle-stair’s pale-paved
11877,THE SUCCUBA,"Alabaster, from the waved"
11878,THE SUCCUBA,"Ocean, grayer than November,"
11879,THE SUCCUBA,"Where I linger, soul-enslaved."
11880,THE SUCCUBA,
11881,THE SUCCUBA,Walls of shadow and of night
11882,THE SUCCUBA,"Lit with casements full of fire,"
11883,THE SUCCUBA,Somber red or piercing white:
11884,THE SUCCUBA,"As the wind breathes lower, higher,"
11885,THE SUCCUBA,Round the towers spirit-things
11886,THE SUCCUBA,"Whisper, and the haunted strings"
11887,THE SUCCUBA,"Moan of each huge, plangent lyre"
11888,THE SUCCUBA,Set upon its four chief wings.
11889,THE SUCCUBA,
11890,THE SUCCUBA,In its corridors at tryst
11891,THE SUCCUBA,Flame-eyed phantoms meet. Its sparry
11892,THE SUCCUBA,Halls are misty amethyst:
11893,THE SUCCUBA,Battlemented ’neath the starry
11894,THE SUCCUBA,Skies it looms; the strange unknown
11895,THE SUCCUBA,"Skies where, green as glow-worms, sown,"
11896,THE SUCCUBA,Gloom the stars; the moon hangs barry
11897,THE SUCCUBA,"Beryl, low and large and lone...."
11898,THE SUCCUBA,
11899,THE SUCCUBA,Can it be a witch is she?
11900,THE SUCCUBA,"Or a vampire? she, far whiter"
11901,THE SUCCUBA,Than the spirits of the sea!--
11902,THE SUCCUBA,"She whose eyes are cold, yet brighter"
11903,THE SUCCUBA,Than her throat’s pale jewels. Lo!
11904,THE SUCCUBA,Flame she is though seeming snow:
11905,THE SUCCUBA,"And her love lies tighter, tighter"
11906,THE SUCCUBA,On my heart than utter woe.
11907,THE SUCCUBA,
11908,THE SUCCUBA,"Though I dream, it seems I live;"
11909,THE SUCCUBA,And my heart is sick with sorrow
11910,THE SUCCUBA,Of the love that it must give
11911,THE SUCCUBA,"To her; passion, it must borrow"
11912,THE SUCCUBA,"Of herself, unhallowed, vain;"
11913,THE SUCCUBA,Then return it her again:
11914,THE SUCCUBA,Thus she holds me; and to-morrow
11915,THE SUCCUBA,Still will hold with sweetest pain.
11916,THE SUCCUBA,
11917,THE SUCCUBA,In her garden’s moon-white space
11918,THE SUCCUBA,"Strangest flowers bloom: huge lilies,"
11919,THE SUCCUBA,Each one with a human face;
11920,THE SUCCUBA,Knots of spirit-amaryllis;
11921,THE SUCCUBA,Cactus-bulks with pulpy blooms
11922,THE SUCCUBA,Gnome-like in the silver glooms;
11923,THE SUCCUBA,"And dim deeps of daffadillies,"
11924,THE SUCCUBA,"Fay-like, brimming faint perfumes."
11925,THE SUCCUBA,
11926,THE SUCCUBA,But to me their fragrance seems
11927,THE SUCCUBA,"Poison; and their lambent lustre,"
11928,THE SUCCUBA,"Spun of twilight and of dreams,"
11929,THE SUCCUBA,Poison; and each pearly cluster
11930,THE SUCCUBA,"Hides a serpent’s fang. And I,"
11931,THE SUCCUBA,"Looking from an oriel, sigh;"
11932,THE SUCCUBA,For my soul is fain to muster
11933,THE SUCCUBA,Heart to breathe of them and die.
11934,THE SUCCUBA,
11935,THE SUCCUBA,"Then I feel big eyes, as bright"
11936,THE SUCCUBA,"As the sea-stars. Gray with glitter,"
11937,THE SUCCUBA,"She behind me, moony white,"
11938,THE SUCCUBA,"Smiles, ’mid hangings wherein flitter"
11939,THE SUCCUBA,Loves and deeds of Amadis
11940,THE SUCCUBA,Darkly worked. And then her kiss
11941,THE SUCCUBA,On my mouth falls; sweet and bitter
11942,THE SUCCUBA,With a bliss that is not bliss.
11943,THE SUCCUBA,
11944,THE SUCCUBA,And I kiss her eyes and hair;
11945,THE SUCCUBA,Smooth her tresses till their golden
11946,THE SUCCUBA,Glimmer sparkles. Everywhere
11947,THE SUCCUBA,"Shapes of strange aromas, holden"
11948,THE SUCCUBA,"Of the walls, around us troop;"
11949,THE SUCCUBA,"And in golden loop on loop,--"
11950,THE SUCCUBA,"Of the lull’d eyes vague beholden,--"
11951,THE SUCCUBA,Forms of music o’er us stoop.
11952,THE SUCCUBA,
11953,THE SUCCUBA,"Yet I see beneath it all,"
11954,THE SUCCUBA,"All this sorcery, a devil,"
11955,THE SUCCUBA,"Beautiful, and white, and tall,"
11956,THE SUCCUBA,Broods with shadowy eyes of evil:
11957,THE SUCCUBA,"She, who must resume with morn"
11958,THE SUCCUBA,"Her true shape: a cactus-thorn,"
11959,THE SUCCUBA,"Monstrous, on some lonely level"
11960,THE SUCCUBA,Of that demon-world forlorn.
11961,THE SUCCUBA,
11962,THE SUCCUBA,I have dreams where I believe
11963,THE SUCCUBA,"That a queen of some dim palace,"
11964,THE SUCCUBA,"One, whose name is Genevieve,"
11965,THE SUCCUBA,Weighs me with her love or malice:
11966,THE SUCCUBA,And all night I am her slave
11967,THE SUCCUBA,"There beside the demon wave,"
11968,THE SUCCUBA,Where I drain the loathsome chalice
11969,THE SUCCUBA,"Of her love, that is my grave."

11983,MASKS,"You, Viola, with your beauty,"

11985,MASKS,You must wed: it is your duty.
11986,MASKS,
11987,MASKS,There’s your poniard; for the second
11988,MASKS,In this tazza dropped: the blood
11989,MASKS,On it scarcely hard.... I reckoned
11990,MASKS,Happily that hour we stood
11991,MASKS,"There upon your palace-stairway,"
11992,MASKS,"How, with the Franciscan hood"
11993,MASKS,"Cowled, I said, there was a bare way."
11994,MASKS,
11995,MASKS,In the minster there I found it--
11996,MASKS,"Our revenge. I saw him, wild,"
11997,MASKS,Stalking towards the church: around it
11998,MASKS,"Dogged him, marking how he smiled"
11999,MASKS,In the moonlight where I waited.
12000,MASKS,"When the great clock, beating, dialed"

12005,MASKS,"Vanished in the dark, when, level"
12006,MASKS,"On the long lagoon, did loom,"
12007,MASKS,"Under moonlight-woven arches,"

12009,MASKS,One tall gondolier: no torches.
12010,MASKS,
12011,MASKS,Dusky gondolas kept bringing
12012,MASKS,Revellers: and far the night
12013,MASKS,Rang with instruments and singing.--
12014,MASKS,From the imbricated light
12015,MASKS,"Of the oar-vibrating water,"
12016,MASKS,"Gliding up the stairway, white,"
12017,MASKS,"Velvet-masked,--the count’s own daughter!"
12018,MASKS,
12019,MASKS,"Quick I met her: whispered, “Flora,"
12020,MASKS,"Gaston.--_Mia_, till they go,"

12022,MASKS,"She’ll perceive us--she, below,"

12024,MASKS,Round the inviolable glow
12025,MASKS,"Of her throat--there, dimly darkling:"
12026,MASKS,
12027,MASKS,“That’s Viola!” ... Thus I drew her
12028,MASKS,In the church’s ancient pile--
12029,MASKS,"Under her black mask I knew her,"
12030,MASKS,"By her chin, her lips, her smile."
12031,MASKS,Through one marble-foliated
12032,MASKS,Window fell the moon-rays. While
12033,MASKS,All the maskers passed we waited.
12034,MASKS,
12035,MASKS,I had drawn the dagger. Turning
12036,MASKS,Called her by her name. Some lie
12037,MASKS,"Of a passion sighed, her burning"
12038,MASKS,"Hand in mine; when, stalking by,"
12039,MASKS,"In the square, _his_ form bejeweled"
12040,MASKS,Gleamed. My very blood burned dry
12041,MASKS,With the hate his presence fueled.
12042,MASKS,
12043,MASKS,Our revenge! up-pushing slightly
12044,MASKS,"Cowl, the mask fell, and revealed"
12045,MASKS,"Balka, as the poniard whitely"
12046,MASKS,Flashed. The hollow nave re-pealed
12047,MASKS,One long shriek the loft repeated.
12048,MASKS,"Swift, I stabbed her thrice. She reeled"
12049,MASKS,"Dead. I thought of you, the heated"
12050,MASKS,
12051,MASKS,Horror on my hands; and tarried
12052,MASKS,Still as silence. Drawn aside
12053,MASKS,"On her face the mask hung, married"
12054,MASKS,To its camphor-pallor: wide
12055,MASKS,Eyes with terror--stone. One second
12056,MASKS,I regretted; then defied
12057,MASKS,All remorse. Your promise beckoned;
12058,MASKS,
12059,MASKS,And I left her. Love had pointed
12060,MASKS,Me this way. I walked the way
12061,MASKS,Clear-eyed and ... it has anointed
12062,MASKS,"Us fast lovers?--Do not say,"
12063,MASKS,"Now, that you will go and nun it!"
12064,MASKS,For this man who scorned you?--Nay!--

12074,CARMEN,"In Andalusian afternoons,"
12075,CARMEN,"With ogling eye and compliment,"
12076,CARMEN,Smiled on you as along you went
12077,CARMEN,Some sleepy street of old Seville;
12078,CARMEN,Twirled with a military skill
12079,CARMEN,Moustaches; buttoned uniforms
12080,CARMEN,Of Spanish yellow bowed your charms.
12081,CARMEN,
12082,CARMEN,"Proud, wicked head, and hair blue-black,"
12083,CARMEN,"Whence the mantilla, half thrown back,"
12084,CARMEN,Discovered shoulders and bold breast
12085,CARMEN,Bohemian brown. And you were dressed
12086,CARMEN,In some short skirt of gypsy red
12087,CARMEN,"Of smuggled stuff; and stockings,--dead"
12088,CARMEN,"White silk,--that, worn with many a hole,"

12096,CARMEN,At bashful José’s nose while loud

12099,CARMEN,"Heaved with the swelling of your bust,"
12100,CARMEN,A bunch of white acacia blooms

12109,CARMEN,"Your crimson dress gleamed, spangled fierce;"

12111,CARMEN,"Shone, wrought Morisco; and each shoe,"
12112,CARMEN,"Of Cordovan leather, buckled blue,"
12113,CARMEN,Glanced merriment; and from large arms

12122,CARMEN,"Of mandolin and gay guitar,"
12123,CARMEN,You in the grated patio
12124,CARMEN,Danced: the curled coxcombs’ staring row
12125,CARMEN,"Rang pleased applause. I saw you dance,"
12126,CARMEN,"With wily motion and glad glance,"
12127,CARMEN,"Voluptuous, the wild _romalis_,"
12128,CARMEN,"Where every movement was a kiss,"
12129,CARMEN,"A song, a poem, interwound"
12130,CARMEN,With your Basque tambourine’s dull sound.
12131,CARMEN,"I,--as the ebon castanets"
12132,CARMEN,"Clucked out dry time in unctuous jets,--"
12133,CARMEN,Saw angry José through the grate
12134,CARMEN,"Glare on us, a pale face of hate,"
12135,CARMEN,When some indecent officer
12136,CARMEN,Presumed too lewdly to you there.

12152,AT NINEVEH,The sands of centuries have long been blown;
12153,AT NINEVEH,Yet sooner shall the night forget its stars
12154,AT NINEVEH,"Than love her story:--How, unto his throne,"
12155,AT NINEVEH,"One day she came, where, with his warriors,"
12156,AT NINEVEH,"The King sat in his hall of audience,"
12157,AT NINEVEH,"’Mid pillared trophies of barbaric wars,"
12158,AT NINEVEH,"And, kneeling to him, asked, “O father, whence"

12160,AT NINEVEH,"“O Hadria, love is of the gods, and hence"
12161,AT NINEVEH,"Divine, is only soul-interpreted."
12162,AT NINEVEH,"But why love is, ah, child, we do not know,"
12163,AT NINEVEH,Unless ’t is love that gives us life when dead.”--
12164,AT NINEVEH,"And then his daughter, with a face aglow"
12165,AT NINEVEH,With all the love that clamored in her blood
12166,AT NINEVEH,"Its sweet avowal, lifted arms of snow,"
12167,AT NINEVEH,"And, like Aurora’s rose, before him stood,"
12168,AT NINEVEH,"Saying,--“Since love is of the powers above,"

12175,AT NINEVEH,"“Enough! ho, Rhana, strike me off her head!”"
12176,AT NINEVEH,"And at the mandate, with his limbs half bare"
12177,AT NINEVEH,A slave strode forth. Majestic was his form
12178,AT NINEVEH,"As some young god’s. He, gathering up her hair,"
12179,AT NINEVEH,Wound it three times around his sinewy arm;
12180,AT NINEVEH,Then drew his sword. It for one moment shone
12181,AT NINEVEH,"A semicircling light, and, dripping warm,"
12182,AT NINEVEH,Lifting the head he stood before the throne.
12183,AT NINEVEH,"Then said the despot, “By the horn of Bel!"
12184,AT NINEVEH,This was no child of mine!”--Like chiseled stone
12185,AT NINEVEH,"Stern stood the slave, a son of Israel."
12186,AT NINEVEH,"Then striding towards the monarch, in his eye"
12187,AT NINEVEH,"The wrath of heaven and the hate of hell,"
12188,AT NINEVEH,"Shrieked, “Beast! I loved her! look on us and die!”"
12189,AT NINEVEH,Swifter than fire clove him to the brain.
12190,AT NINEVEH,"Then kissed her face, and, holding it on high,"
12191,AT NINEVEH,"Cried out, “Judge thou, O God, between us twain!”"
