123,PAGE,Postlude
124,PAGE,
125,PAGE,
126,PAGE,Now that I have cooled to you
127,PAGE,"Let there be gold of tarnished masonry,"
128,PAGE,Temples soothed by the sun to ruin
129,PAGE,That sleep utterly.
130,PAGE,"Give me hand for the dances,"
131,PAGE,"Ripples at Philae, in and out,"
132,PAGE,"And lips, my Lesbian,"
133,PAGE,Wall flowers that once were flame.
134,PAGE,
135,PAGE,Your hair is my Carthage
136,PAGE,"And my arms the bow,"
137,PAGE,And our words arrows
138,PAGE,To shoot the stars
139,PAGE,Who from that misty sea
140,PAGE,Swarm to destroy us.
141,PAGE,
142,PAGE,But you there beside me--
143,PAGE,"Oh how shall I defy you,"
144,PAGE,Who wound me in the night
145,PAGE,With breasts shining
146,PAGE,Like Venus and like Mars?
147,PAGE,The night that is shouting Jason
148,PAGE,When the loud eaves rattle
149,PAGE,As with waves above me
150,PAGE,Blue at the prow of my desire.

155,PAGE,First Praise
156,PAGE,
157,PAGE,
158,PAGE,"Lady of dusk wood fastnesses,"
159,PAGE,Thou art my Lady.
160,PAGE,"I have known the crisp splintering leaf-tread with thee on before,"
161,PAGE,"White, slender through green saplings;"
162,PAGE,I have lain by thee on the grey forest floor
163,PAGE,"Beside thee, my Lady."
164,PAGE,
165,PAGE,"Lady of rivers strewn with stones,"
166,PAGE,Only thou art my Lady.
167,PAGE,Where thousand the freshets are crowded like peasants to a fair;
168,PAGE,"Clear skinned, wild from seclusion,"
169,PAGE,They jostle white armed down the tent-bordered thoroughfare
170,PAGE,Praising my Lady.

176,PAGE,
177,PAGE,
178,PAGE,"Elvira, by love's grace"
179,PAGE,There goeth before you
180,PAGE,A clear radiance
181,PAGE,Which maketh all vain souls
182,PAGE,Candles when noon is.
183,PAGE,
184,PAGE,The loud clangour of pretenders
185,PAGE,Melteth before you
186,PAGE,"Like the roll of carts passing,"
187,PAGE,But you come silently
188,PAGE,And homage is given.
189,PAGE,
190,PAGE,Now the little by-path
191,PAGE,Which leadeth to love
192,PAGE,Is again joyful with its many;
193,PAGE,And the great highway
194,PAGE,From love
195,PAGE,Is without passers.

201,PAGE,
202,PAGE,
203,PAGE,I tried to put a bird in a cage.
204,PAGE,O fool that I am!
205,PAGE,For the bird was Truth.
206,PAGE,"Sing merrily, Truth: I tried to put"
207,PAGE,Truth in a cage!
208,PAGE,
209,PAGE,"And when I had the bird in the cage,"
210,PAGE,O fool that I am!
211,PAGE,"Why, it broke my pretty cage."
212,PAGE,"Sing merrily, Truth; I tried to put"
213,PAGE,Truth in a cage!
214,PAGE,
215,PAGE,"And when the bird was flown from the cage,"
216,PAGE,O fool that I am!
217,PAGE,"Why, I had nor bird nor cage."
218,PAGE,"Sing merrily, Truth: I tried to put"
219,PAGE,Truth in a cage!
220,PAGE,Heigh-ho! Truth in a cage.

227,PAGE,
228,PAGE,Come with us and play!
229,PAGE,"See, we have breasts as women!"
230,PAGE,From your tents by the sea
231,PAGE,Come play with us: it is forbidden!
232,PAGE,
233,PAGE,Come with us and play!
234,PAGE,"Lo, bare, straight legs in the water!"
235,PAGE,"By our boats we stay,"
236,PAGE,Then swimming away
237,PAGE,Come to us: it is forbidden!
238,PAGE,
239,PAGE,Come with us and play!
240,PAGE,"See, we are tall as women!"
241,PAGE,Our eyes are keen:
242,PAGE,Our hair is bright:
243,PAGE,Our voices speak outright:
244,PAGE,We revel in the sea's green!
245,PAGE,Come play:
246,PAGE,It is forbidden!

251,PAGE,Immortal
252,PAGE,
253,PAGE,
254,PAGE,"Yes, there is one thing braver than all flowers;"
255,PAGE,Richer than clear gems; wider than the sky;
256,PAGE,Immortal and unchangeable; whose powers
257,PAGE,"Transcend reason, love and sanity!"
258,PAGE,
259,PAGE,"And thou, beloved, art that godly thing!"
260,PAGE,Marvellous and terrible; in glance
261,PAGE,An injured Juno roused against Heaven's King!
262,PAGE,"And thy name, lovely One, is Ignorance."

272,PAGE,To make it right again!

274,PAGE,"I'm sorry, Grace; but then,"
275,PAGE,It's not my fault if you will be a cat.

280,PAGE,An After Song
281,PAGE,
282,PAGE,
283,PAGE,"So art thou broken in upon me, Apollo,"
284,PAGE,Through a splendour of purple garments--
285,PAGE,Held by the yellow-haired Clym√®ne
286,PAGE,To clothe the white of thy shoulders--
287,PAGE,Bare from the day's leaping of horses.
288,PAGE,"This is strange to me, here in the modern twilight."

293,PAGE,Crude Lament
294,PAGE,
295,PAGE,
296,PAGE,"Mother of flames,"
297,PAGE,The men that went ahunting
298,PAGE,Are asleep in the snow drifts.
299,PAGE,You have kept the fire burning!
300,PAGE,Crooked fingers that pull
301,PAGE,"Fuel from among the wet leaves,"
302,PAGE,Mother of flames
303,PAGE,You have kept the fire burning!
304,PAGE,The young wives have fallen asleep
305,PAGE,"With wet hair, weeping,"
306,PAGE,Mother of flames!
307,PAGE,The young men raised the heavy spears
308,PAGE,And are gone prowling in the darkness.
309,PAGE,"O mother of flames,"
310,PAGE,You who have kept the fire burning!
311,PAGE,"Lo, I am helpless!"
312,PAGE,Would God they had taken me with them!
313,PAGE,
314,PAGE,
315,PAGE,
316,PAGE,
317,PAGE,The Ordeal
318,PAGE,
319,PAGE,
320,PAGE,"O Crimson salamander,"
321,PAGE,Because of love's whim
322,PAGE,sacred!
323,PAGE,Swim
324,PAGE,the winding flame
325,PAGE,Predestined to disman him
326,PAGE,And bring our fellow home to us again.
327,PAGE,
328,PAGE,"Swim in with watery fang,"
329,PAGE,Gnaw out and drown
330,PAGE,The fire roots that circle him
331,PAGE,Until the Hell-flower dies down
332,PAGE,And he comes home again.
333,PAGE,
334,PAGE,"Aye, bring him home,"
335,PAGE,"O crimson salamander,"
336,PAGE,That I may see he is unchanged with burning--
337,PAGE,"Then have your will with him,"
338,PAGE,O crimson salamander.
339,PAGE,
340,PAGE,
341,PAGE,
342,PAGE,
343,PAGE,The Death of Franco of Cologne:
344,PAGE,His Prophecy of Beethoven
345,PAGE,
346,PAGE,
347,PAGE,"It is useless, good woman, useless: the spark fails me."
348,PAGE,God! yet when the might of it all assails me
349,PAGE,It seems impossible that I cannot do it.
350,PAGE,"Yet I cannot. They were right, and they all knew it"
351,PAGE,"Years ago, but I--never! I have persisted"
352,PAGE,Blindly (they say) and now I am old. I have resisted
353,PAGE,"Everything, but now, now the strife's ended."
354,PAGE,The fire's out; the old cloak has been mended
355,PAGE,"For the last time, the soul peers through its tatters."
356,PAGE,Put a light by and leave me; nothing more matters
357,PAGE,Now; I am done; I am at last well broken!
358,PAGE,"Yet, by God, I'll still leave them a token"
359,PAGE,That they'll swear it was no dead man writ it;
360,PAGE,"A morsel that they'll mark well the day they bit it,"
361,PAGE,That there'll be sand between their gross teeth to crunch yet
362,PAGE,When goodman Gabriel blows his concluding trumpet.
363,PAGE,Leave me!
364,PAGE,"And now, little black eyes, come you out here!"
365,PAGE,"Ah, you've given me a lively, lasting bout, year"
366,PAGE,After year to win you round me darlings!
367,PAGE,"Precious children, little gambollers! ""farlings"""
368,PAGE,"They might have called you once, ""nearlings"""
369,PAGE,"I call you now, I, first of all the yearlings,"
370,PAGE,"Upon this plain, for I it was that tore you"
371,PAGE,Out of chaos! It was I bore you!
372,PAGE,"Ah, you little children that go playing"
373,PAGE,"Over the five-barred gate, and will still be straying"
374,PAGE,Spite of all that I have ever told you
375,PAGE,Of counterpoint and cadence which does not hold you--
376,PAGE,"No more than chains will for this or that strange reason,"
377,PAGE,But you're always at some new loving treason
378,PAGE,"To be away from me, laughing, mocking,"
379,PAGE,"Witlessly, perhaps, but for all that forever knocking"
380,PAGE,"At this stanchion door of your poor father's heart till--oh, well"
381,PAGE,At least you've shown that you can grow well
382,PAGE,"However much you evade me faster, faster."
383,PAGE,"But, black eyes, some day you'll get a master,"
384,PAGE,"For he will come! He shall, he must come!"
385,PAGE,And when he finishes and the burning dust from
386,PAGE,His wheels settles--what shall men see then?
387,PAGE,"You, you, you, my own lovely children!"
388,PAGE,"Aye, all of you, thus with hands together"
389,PAGE,"Playing on the hill or there in a tether,"
390,PAGE,"Or running free, but all mine! Aye, my very namesakes"
391,PAGE,Shall be his proper fame's stakes.
392,PAGE,And he shall lead you!
393,PAGE,And he shall meed you!
394,PAGE,And he shall build you gold palaces!
395,PAGE,And he shall wine you from clear chalices!
396,PAGE,For I have seen it! I have seen it
397,PAGE,Written where the world-clouds screen it
398,PAGE,From other eyes
399,PAGE,Over the bronze gates of paradise!

405,PAGE,
406,PAGE,
407,PAGE,"Red cradle of the night,"
408,PAGE,In you
409,PAGE,The dusky child
410,PAGE,Sleeps fast till his might
411,PAGE,Shall be piled
412,PAGE,Sinew on sinew.
413,PAGE,
414,PAGE,"Red cradle of the night,"
415,PAGE,The dusky child
416,PAGE,Sleeping sits upright.
417,PAGE,Lo how
418,PAGE,The winds blow now!
419,PAGE,He pillows back;
420,PAGE,The winds are again mild.
421,PAGE,
422,PAGE,"When he stretches his arms out,"
423,PAGE,"Red cradle of the night,"
424,PAGE,The alarms shout
425,PAGE,"From bare tree to tree,"
426,PAGE,Wild
427,PAGE,In afright!
428,PAGE,"Mighty shall he be,"
429,PAGE,"Red cradle of the night,"
430,PAGE,The dusky child!!

437,PAGE,
438,PAGE,"Miserly, is the best description of that poor fool"
439,PAGE,"Who holds Lancelot to have been a morose fellow,"
440,PAGE,Dolefully brooding over the events which had naturally to follow
441,PAGE,The high time of his deed with Guinevere.
442,PAGE,"He has a sick historical sight, if I judge rightly,"
443,PAGE,To believe any such thing as that ever occurred.
444,PAGE,"But, by the god of blood, what else is it that has deterred"
445,PAGE,Us all from an out and out defiance of fear
446,PAGE,"But this same perdamnable miserliness,"
447,PAGE,Which cries about our necks how we shall have less and less
448,PAGE,Than we have now if we spend too wantonly?
449,PAGE,
450,PAGE,"Bah, this sort of slither is below contempt!"
451,PAGE,
452,PAGE,In the same vein we should have apple trees exempt
453,PAGE,"From bearing anything but pink blossoms all the year,"
454,PAGE,"Fixed permanent lest their bellies wax unseemly, and the dear"
455,PAGE,Innocent days of them be wasted quite.
456,PAGE,
457,PAGE,How can we have less? Have we not the deed?
458,PAGE,
459,PAGE,"Lancelot thought little, spent his gold and rode to fight"
460,PAGE,"Mounted, if God was willing, on a good steed."

463,PAGE,
464,PAGE,
465,PAGE,Ad Infinitum
466,PAGE,
467,PAGE,
468,PAGE,Still I bring flowers
469,PAGE,Although you fling them at my feet
470,PAGE,Until none stays
471,PAGE,That is not struck across with wounds:
472,PAGE,Flowers and flowers
473,PAGE,That you may break them utterly
474,PAGE,As you have always done.
475,PAGE,
476,PAGE,Sure happily
477,PAGE,"I still bring flowers, flowers,"
478,PAGE,Knowing how all
479,PAGE,Are crumpled in your praise
480,PAGE,And may not live
481,PAGE,To speak a lesser thing.

491,I,
492,I,Although you do your best to regard me
493,I,"With an air seeming offended,"
494,I,"Never can you deny, when all's ended,"
495,I,"Calm eyes, that you _did_ regard me."
496,I,
497,I,However much you're at pains to
498,I,"Offend me, by which I may suffer,"
499,I,What offence is there can make up for
500,I,The great good he finds who attains you?
501,I,"For though with mortal fear you reward me,"
502,I,"Until my sorry sense is plenished,"
503,I,"Never can you deny, when all's ended,"
504,I,"Calm eyes, that you did regard me."
505,I,
506,I,Thinking thus to dismay me
507,I,"You beheld me with disdain,"
508,I,"But instead of destroying the gain,"
509,I,In fact with doubled good you paid me.
510,I,For though you show them how hardly
511,I,"They keep off from leniency bended,"
512,I,"Never can you deny, when all's ended,"
513,I,"Calm eyes, that you did regard me."

521,II,That you think of me somewise.
522,II,
523,II,The day of departure
524,II,You came full of grieving
525,II,And to see I was leaving
526,II,The tears 'gan to start sure
527,II,With the heavy torture
528,II,Of sorrows unbrightened
529,II,When you lie down at night and
530,II,"When there to you dreams rise,"
531,II,"Ah, Heaven be willing"
532,II,That you think of me somewise.
533,II,
534,II,Deep is my assurance
535,II,"Of you, little green eyes,"
536,II,That in truth you realise
537,II,Something of my durance
538,II,Eyes of hope's fair assurance
539,II,And good premonition
540,II,By virtue of whose condition
541,II,All green colours I prize.
542,II,"Ah, Heaven be willing"
543,II,That you think of me somewise.
544,II,
545,II,Would God I might know you
546,II,To which quarter bended
547,II,And why comprehended
548,II,"When sighings overflow you,"
549,II,And if you must go through
550,II,"Some certain despair,"
551,II,For that you lose his care
552,II,Who was faithful always.
553,II,"Ah, Heaven be willing"
554,II,That you think of me these days.
555,II,
556,II,Through never a moment
557,II,I've known how to live lest
558,II,All my thoughts but as one pressed
559,II,You-ward for their concernment.
560,II,May God send chastisement
561,II,If in this I belie me
562,II,And if it truth be
563,II,My own little green eyes.
564,II,"Ah, Heaven be willing"
565,II,That you think of me somewise.

568,III,III
569,III,
570,III,"Poplars of the meadow,"
571,III,"Fountains of Madrid,"
572,III,Now I am absent from you
573,III,All are slandering me.
574,III,
575,III,Each of you is telling
576,III,How evil my chance is
577,III,"The wind among the branches,"
578,III,The fountains in their welling
579,III,To every one telling
580,III,You were happy to see.
581,III,Now I am absent from you
582,III,All are slandering me.
583,III,
584,III,With good right I may wonder
585,III,For that at my last leaving
586,III,The plants with sighs heaving
587,III,And the waters in tears were.
588,III,"That you played double, never"
589,III,"Thought I this could be,"
590,III,Now I am absent from you
591,III,All are slandering me.
592,III,
593,III,There full in your presence
594,III,"Music you sought to waken,"
595,III,Later I'm forsaken
596,III,Since you are ware of my absence.
597,III,"God, wilt Thou give me patience"
598,III,"Here while suffer I ye,"
599,III,Now I am absent from you
600,III,All are slandering me.
601,III,
602,III,
603,IV,IV
604,IV,
605,IV,"The day draweth nearer,"
606,IV,"And morrow ends our meeting,"
607,IV,Ere they take thee sleeping
608,IV,"Be up--away, my treasure!"
609,IV,
610,IV,"Soft, leave her breasts all unheeded,"
611,IV,Far hence though the master still remaineth!
612,IV,For soon uptil our earth regaineth
613,IV,The sun all embraces dividing.
614,IV,"N'er grew pleasure all unimpeded,"
615,IV,"N'er was delight lest passion won,"
616,IV,And to the wise man the fit occasion
617,IV,Has not yet refused a full measure:
618,IV,"Be up--away, my treasure!"
619,IV,
620,IV,If that my love thy bosom inflameth
621,IV,"With honest purpose and just intention,"
622,IV,To free me from my soul's contention
623,IV,Give over joys the day shameth;
624,IV,"Who thee lameth he also me lameth,"
625,IV,And my good grace builds all in thy good grace;
626,IV,"Be up--away! Fear leaveth place,"
627,IV,"That thou art here, no more unto pleasure,"
628,IV,"Be up--away, my treasure!"
629,IV,
630,IV,"Although thou with a sleep art wresting,"
631,IV,"'Tis rightful thou bringst it close,"
632,IV,That of the favour one meeting shows
633,IV,An hundred may hence be attesting.
634,IV,'Tis fitting too thou shouldst be mindful
635,IV,"That the ease which we lose now, in kind, full"
636,IV,Many a promise holds for our leisure;
637,IV,Ere they take thee sleeping;
638,IV,"Be up--away, my treasure!"
639,IV,
640,IV,
641,IV,
642,IV,
643,IV,Hic Jacet
644,IV,
645,IV,
646,IV,The coroner's merry little children
647,IV,Have such twinkling brown eyes.
648,IV,Their father is not of gay men
649,IV,"And their mother jocular in no wise,"
650,IV,Yet the coroner's merry little children
651,IV,Laugh so easily.
652,IV,
653,IV,They laugh because they prosper.
654,IV,Fruit for them is upon all branches.
655,IV,"Lo! how they jibe at loss, for"
656,IV,Kind heaven fills their little paunches!
657,IV,"It's the coroner's merry, merry children"
658,IV,Who laugh so easily.
659,IV,
660,IV,
661,IV,
662,IV,
663,IV,Contemporania
664,IV,
665,IV,
666,IV,The corner of a great rain
667,IV,Steamy with the country
668,IV,Has fallen upon my garden.
669,IV,
670,IV,I go back and forth now
671,IV,And the little leaves follow me
672,IV,"Talking of the great rain,"
673,IV,"Of branches broken,"
674,IV,And the farmer's curses!
675,IV,
676,IV,But I go back and forth
677,IV,In this corner of a garden
678,IV,And the green shoots follow me
679,IV,Praising the great rain.
680,IV,
681,IV,"We are not curst together,"
682,IV,"The leaves and I,"
683,IV,"Framing devices, flower devices"
684,IV,And other ways of peopling
685,IV,The barren country.
686,IV,
687,IV,Truly it was a very great rain
688,IV,That makes the little leaves follow me.
689,IV,
690,IV,
691,IV,
692,IV,
693,IV,To wish Myself Courage
694,IV,
695,IV,
696,IV,On the day when youth is no more upon me
697,IV,I will write of the leaves and the moon in a tree top!
698,IV,"I will sing then the song, long in the making--"
699,IV,When the stress of youth is put away from me.
700,IV,
701,IV,How can I ever be written out as men say?
702,IV,Surely it is merely an interference with the long song--
703,IV,This that I am now doing.
704,IV,
705,IV,But when the spring of it is worn like the old moon
706,IV,And the eaten leaves are lace upon the cold earth--
707,IV,Then I will rise up in my great desire--
708,IV,Long at the birth--and sing me the youth-song!
