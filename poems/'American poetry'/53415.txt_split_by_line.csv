61,INTRODUCTION,
62,INTRODUCTION,"Each morning, for several months, THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE has published at"
63,INTRODUCTION,"the head of its first column, verses under the caption: “Poems You Ought"
64,INTRODUCTION,to Know.”  It has explained its action by the following quotation from
65,INTRODUCTION,Professor Charles Eliot Norton:
66,INTRODUCTION,
67,INTRODUCTION,"“_Whatever your occupation may be_, _and however crowded your hours"
68,INTRODUCTION,"with affairs_, _do not fail to secure at least a few minutes every"
69,INTRODUCTION,day for refreshment of your inner life with a bit of poetry_.”
70,INTRODUCTION,
71,INTRODUCTION,By publishing these poems THE TRIBUNE hopes to accomplish two things:
72,INTRODUCTION,"first, to inspire a love of poetry in the hearts of many of its readers"
73,INTRODUCTION,who have never before taken time or thought to read the best poems of
74,INTRODUCTION,"this and other centuries and lands; and, secondly, to remind those who"
75,INTRODUCTION,"once loved song, but forgot it among the louder voices of the world, of"
76,INTRODUCTION,the melody that enchanted them in youth.
77,INTRODUCTION,
78,INTRODUCTION,"The title has carried with it its own standard, and the poems have been"
79,INTRODUCTION,kept on a plane above jocularity or mere prettiness of versification;
80,INTRODUCTION,"rather have they tried to teach the doctrines of courage, of nature-love,"
81,INTRODUCTION,of pure and noble melody.  It has been the ambition of those selecting
82,INTRODUCTION,the verses to choose something to lift the reader above the “petty round
83,INTRODUCTION,"of irritating concerns and duties,” and the object will have been"
84,INTRODUCTION,"achieved if it has helped anyone to “play the man,” “to go blithely about"
85,INTRODUCTION,"his business all the day,” with a consciousness of that abounding beauty"
86,INTRODUCTION,in the world of thought which is the common property of all men.
87,INTRODUCTION,
88,INTRODUCTION,"No anthology of English verse can be complete, and none can satisfy all."
89,INTRODUCTION,"The compiler’s individual taste, tempered and guided by established"
90,INTRODUCTION,"authority, is almost the only standard.  This collection has been"
91,INTRODUCTION,"compiled not by one but by many thousands, and their selections here"
92,INTRODUCTION,appear edited and winnowed as the idea of the series seemed to dictate.
93,INTRODUCTION,The book appears at the wide-spread and almost universal request of those
94,INTRODUCTION,who have watched the bold experiment of a great Twentieth-Century
95,INTRODUCTION,American newspaper giving the place of honor in its columns every day to
96,INTRODUCTION,a selection from the poets.
97,INTRODUCTION,
98,INTRODUCTION,"For permission to reprint certain poems by Longfellow, Lowell, Harte,"
99,INTRODUCTION,"Hay, Bayard Taylor, Holmes, Whittier, Parsons, and Aldrich, graciously"
100,INTRODUCTION,"accorded by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., the publishers, thanks are"
101,INTRODUCTION,"gratefully acknowledged.  To Charles Scribner’s Sons, for an extract from"
102,INTRODUCTION,"Lanier’s poems, and, lastly, to the many thousand readers, who, by their"
103,INTRODUCTION,"sympathy, appreciation, and help have encouraged the continuance of the"
104,INTRODUCTION,"daily publication of the poems, similar gratitude is felt."

1826,BY GEOFFREY CHAUCER.,"imprisoned in France.  He was on an embassy to Genoa in 1372, met"

5866,BEN JONSON.,"Ben Jonson was born about the year 1573, at Westminster.  Little is known"
5867,BEN JONSON.,"about his early life, but in 1597 he is found playing and writing for"
5868,BEN JONSON.,"“The Admiral’s Men,” and later for the “Lord Chamberlain’s Servants.”"
5869,BEN JONSON.,"Afterwards he stood in great favor at court, and wrote many of his best"
5870,BEN JONSON.,"plays during that time—the “Alchemist,” “Catiline,” “Bartholomew Fair,”"
5871,BEN JONSON.,"and “Epicoene.”  He died in 1637, after several years of illness, which"
5872,BEN JONSON.,affected his wit and brilliancy in such a manner that many of his later
5873,BEN JONSON.,plays were not heard to the end.  He is buried in Westminster Abbey.  He
5874,BEN JONSON.,also wrote some prose and some of the most beautiful lyrics of the
5875,BEN JONSON.,English language.
