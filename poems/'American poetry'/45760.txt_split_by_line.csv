523,ACT I,
524,ACT I,_Berengere._ Whose end may be--
525,ACT I,
526,ACT I,_Camarin._                      Dawn and the dewy lark!
527,ACT I,And passing of all presage from you.
528,ACT I,
529,ACT I,_Berengere_ (_sits_).               No:
530,ACT I,"For think, Yolanda's look when by the cypress"
531,ACT I,We read the verses! And my dream that I
532,ACT I,Should with a cross--inscrutable is sleep!--
533,ACT I,Bring her deep bitterness.
534,ACT I,
535,ACT I,_Camarin._                 Dreams are a brood
536,ACT I,Born of the night and not of destiny.
537,ACT I,"She guesses not our guilt, and Renier"
538,ACT I,Clasps to his breast ambition as a bride--
539,ACT I,Ambition for Amaury.
540,ACT I,
541,ACT I,_Berengere._         None can say.
542,ACT I,"He's much with this Venetian, our guest."
543,ACT I,Though Venice gyves us more with tyranny
544,ACT I,Than would the Saracen.
545,ACT I,
546,ACT I,_Camarin._              But through this lady
547,ACT I,"Of the Pisani, powerful in Venice,"
548,ACT I,He hopes to lift again his dynasty
549,ACT I,"Up from decay; and to restore this island,"
550,ACT I,"This venture-dream of the seas, unto his house."
551,ACT I,"'Tis clear, my Berengere!"
552,ACT I,
553,ACT I,"_Berengere._              Then, _her_ design?"
554,ACT I,And what the requital that entices her?
555,ACT I,
556,ACT I,(_Rises._)
557,ACT I,
558,ACT I,"Evil will come of it, to us some evil,"
559,ACT I,Or to Yolanda and Amaury's love.
560,ACT I,"But, there; the women."
561,ACT I,
562,ACT I,_Camarin._             And too brief their stay.
563,ACT I,What signal for to-night?
564,ACT I,
565,ACT I,_Berengere._              Be in the garden.
566,ACT I,Over the threshold yonder I will wave
567,ACT I,"The candle-sign, when all are passed to sleep."
568,ACT I,
569,ACT I,_Camarin._ And with the beam I shall mount up to you
570,ACT I,Quicker than ecstasy.
571,ACT I,
572,ACT I,_Berengere._          I am as a leaf
573,ACT I,Before the wind and raging of your love.
574,ACT I,Go--go.
575,ACT I,
576,ACT I,_Camarin._ But to return unto your breast!
577,ACT I,
578,ACT I,(_He leaves her by the divan._)
579,ACT I,
580,ACT I,(_The women re-enter with silver
581,ACT I,lighted lamps; behind them are_
582,ACT I,HASSAN _and the slave_ SMARDA.
583,ACT I,"_They wait for_ BERENGERE, _who has"
584,ACT I,"stood silent, to speak._)"
585,ACT I,
586,ACT I,"_Berengere_ (_looking up_). Ah, you are come; I had forgotten."
587,ACT I,"And it is time for sleep.--Hassan, the gates:"
588,ACT I,Close them.
589,ACT I,
590,ACT I,"_Hassan._   And chain them, lady?"
591,ACT I,
592,ACT I,_Berengere._                      Wait no longer.
593,ACT I,Lord Renier will not come.
594,ACT I,
595,ACT I,_Hassan._                  No word of him?
596,ACT I,
597,ACT I,"_Berengere._ None, though he yesterday left Nicosie"
598,ACT I,With the priest Moro.
599,ACT I,
600,ACT I,_Hassan._             Lady--
601,ACT I,
602,ACT I,_Berengere._                 Wait no longer.
603,ACT I,"Come, women, with your lamps and light the way."
604,ACT I,
605,ACT I,(_The women go by the steps._
606,ACT I,BERENGERE _follows._)
607,ACT I,
608,ACT I,_Hassan_ (_staring after her_). The reason of this mood in her?
609,ACT I,The reason?
610,ACT I,Something is vile. Lady Yolanda weeps
611,ACT I,In secret; all for what?--unless because
612,ACT I,Of the Paphian--or this Venetian.
613,ACT I,"(_Seeing_ SMARDA.) Now,"
614,ACT I,Slave! Scythian! You linger?
615,ACT I,
616,ACT I,_Smarda._                    I am bidden--
617,ACT I,My mistress.
618,ACT I,
619,ACT I,"_Hassan._    Spa! Thy mistress hath, I think,"
620,ACT I,Something of hell in her and has unpacked
621,ACT I,A portion in this castle. Is it so?
622,ACT I,
623,ACT I,_Smarda._ My lady is of Venice.
624,ACT I,
625,ACT I,"_Hassan._                       Strike her, God."
626,ACT I,Her smirk admits it.
627,ACT I,
628,ACT I,_Smarda._            Touch me not!
629,ACT I,
630,ACT I,_Hassan._                          I'll wring
631,ACT I,"Thy tongue out sudden, if it now has lies."
632,ACT I,What of thy lady and Lord Renier?
633,ACT I,
634,ACT I,_Smarda._                         Off!
635,ACT I,
636,ACT I,"(RENIER _enters behind, with_ MORO.)"
637,ACT I,
638,ACT I,"_Hassan._ Thy lady and Lord Renier, I say!"
639,ACT I,What do they purpose?
640,ACT I,
641,ACT I,_Smarda._             Fool-born! look around.
642,ACT I,
643,ACT I,_Hassan._ Not till----
644,ACT I,
645,ACT I,"_Smarda._              Lord Renier, help."
646,ACT I,
647,ACT I,_Hassan._                                 What do you say?
648,ACT I,
649,ACT I,"(_Turns, and stares amazed._)"
650,ACT I,
651,ACT I,A fool I am....
652,ACT I,
653,ACT I,_Renier._       Where is my wife?
654,ACT I,
655,ACT I,"_Hassan._                         Why, she...."
656,ACT I,This slave stung me to pry.
657,ACT I,
658,ACT I,_Renier._                   Where is my wife?
659,ACT I,
660,ACT I,"_Hassan._ A moment since, was here--the women with her."
661,ACT I,She asked for your return.
662,ACT I,
663,ACT I,_Renier._                  And wherefore did?
664,ACT I,
665,ACT I,_Hassan._ You jeer me.
666,ACT I,
667,ACT I,_Renier._              Answer.
668,ACT I,
669,ACT I,_Hassan._                      Have you not been gone?
670,ACT I,
671,ACT I,_Renier._ Not--overfar. Where is Yolanda?--Well?
672,ACT I,No matter; find my chamber till I come.
673,ACT I,"Of my arrival, too, no word to any."
674,ACT I,
675,ACT I,"(HASSAN _goes, confused._)"
676,ACT I,
677,ACT I,"You, Moro, have deferred me; now, no more."
678,ACT I,"Whether it is suspicion eats in me,"
679,ACT I,"Mistrust and fret and doubt--of whom I say not,"
680,ACT I,Or whether desire and unsubduable
681,ACT I,To see Amaury sceptred--I care not.
682,ACT I,
683,ACT I,(_To_ SMARDA.)
684,ACT I,
685,ACT I,"Slave, to your lady who awaits me, say"
686,ACT I,I'm here and now have chosen.
687,ACT I,
688,ACT I,_Moro._                       Do not!
689,ACT I,
690,ACT I,_Renier._                             Chosen.
691,ACT I,
692,ACT I,(SMARDA _goes._)
693,ACT I,
694,ACT I,None can be great who will not hush his heart
695,ACT I,"To hold a sceptre, and Amaury must."
696,ACT I,He is Lusignan and his lineage
697,ACT I,Will drown in him Yolanda's loveliness.
698,ACT I,
699,ACT I,_Moro._ It will not.
700,ACT I,
701,ACT I,_Renier._            Then at least I shall uncover
702,ACT I,What this Venetian hints.
703,ACT I,
704,ACT I,_Moro._                   Hints?
705,ACT I,
706,ACT I,_Renier._                        I must know.
707,ACT I,
708,ACT I,_Moro._ 'Tis of your wife?--Yolanda?
709,ACT I,
710,ACT I,_Renier._                            Name them not.
711,ACT I,They've shut from me their souls.
712,ACT I,
713,ACT I,"_Moro._                           My lord, not so;"
714,ACT I,But you repulse them.
715,ACT I,
716,ACT I,"_Renier._              When they pity. No,"
717,ACT I,Something has gone from me or never was
718,ACT I,Within my breast. I love not--am unlovable.
719,ACT I,"Amaury is not so,"
720,ACT I,And this Venetian Vittia Pisani----
721,ACT I,
722,ACT I,_Moro._ Distrust her!
723,ACT I,
724,ACT I,_Renier._             She has power.
725,ACT I,
726,ACT I,_Moro._                              But not truth.
727,ACT I,And yesterday a holy relic scorned.
728,ACT I,
729,ACT I,_Renier._ She loves Amaury. Wed to her he will
730,ACT I,Be the elected Governor of Cyprus.
731,ACT I,"The throne, then, but a step."
732,ACT I,
733,ACT I,_Moro._                       But all too great.
734,ACT I,And think; Yolanda is to him as heaven:
735,ACT I,He will not yield her.
736,ACT I,
737,ACT I,"_Renier._              Then he must. And she,"
738,ACT I,"The Venetian, has ways to it--a secret"
739,ACT I,To pierce her from his arms.
740,ACT I,
741,ACT I,"_Moro._                      Sir, sir?--of what?"
742,ACT I,
743,ACT I,"_Renier._ I know not, of some shame."
744,ACT I,
745,ACT I,_Moro._                              Shame!
746,ACT I,
747,ACT I,_Renier._                                   Why do you clutch me?
748,ACT I,
749,ACT I,_Moro._ I--am a priest--and shame----
750,ACT I,
751,ACT I,_Renier._                             You have suspicion?
752,ACT I,
753,ACT I,(VITTIA _enters unnoted._)
754,ACT I,
755,ACT I,"Of whom?--Of whom, and what?"
756,ACT I,
757,ACT I,"_Vittia_ (_lightly_).        My lord, of women."
758,ACT I,
759,ACT I,(RENIER _starts and turns._)
760,ACT I,
761,ACT I,So does the Holy Church instill him.
762,ACT I,
763,ACT I,_Renier._                          You
764,ACT I,"Come softly, lady of Venice."
765,ACT I,
766,ACT I,_Vittia._                    Streets of sea
767,ACT I,In Venice teach us.
768,ACT I,
769,ACT I,"_Renier._           Of what women, then?"
770,ACT I,My wife? Yolanda?
771,ACT I,
772,ACT I,"_Vittia._         By the freedom due us,"
773,ACT I,What matters it? In Venice our lords know
774,ACT I,That beauty has no master.
775,ACT I,
776,ACT I,"_Renier._                  Has no.... That,"
777,ACT I,That too has something hid.
778,ACT I,
779,ACT I,_Vittia._                   Suspicious lord!
780,ACT I,Yet Berengere Lusignan is his wife!
781,ACT I,And soon Yolanda--But for that I'm here.
782,ACT I,You sent for me.
783,ACT I,
784,ACT I,_Renier_ (_sullen_). I sent.
785,ACT I,
786,ACT I,_Vittia._                    To say you've chosen?
787,ACT I,And offer me irrevocable aid
788,ACT I,To win Amaury?
789,ACT I,
790,ACT I,_Renier._      All is vain in me
791,ACT I,Before the fever for it.
792,ACT I,
793,ACT I,"_Vittia._                Then, I shall."
794,ACT I,It must be done. My want is unafraid.
795,ACT I,Hourly I am expecting out of Venice
796,ACT I,Letters of power.
797,ACT I,And what to you I pledge is he shall be
798,ACT I,Ruler of Cyprus and these Mediterranean
799,ACT I,Blue seas that rock ever against its coast.
800,ACT I,That do I pledge ... but more.
801,ACT I,
802,ACT I,_Renier._                           Of rule?... Then what?
803,ACT I,
804,ACT I,_Vittia_ (_going up to him_). Of shame withheld--dishonour unrevealed.
805,ACT I,
806,ACT I,(_He half recoils and stands._
807,ACT I,SMARDA _enters hastily to them._)
808,ACT I,
809,ACT I,_Smarda._ My lady--
810,ACT I,
811,ACT I,_Vittia._           Speak.
812,ACT I,
813,ACT I,_Smarda._                 _She!_
814,ACT I,
815,ACT I,_Vittia._                        Who? Yolanda? comes?
816,ACT I,"She's not asleep as you averred to me,"
817,ACT I,"Was not asleep, but comes?... My lord--!"
818,ACT I,
819,ACT I,"_Renier._                                I'll stay,"
820,ACT I,Stay and confront her.
821,ACT I,
822,ACT I,_Vittia._              Ignorantly? No.
823,ACT I,
824,ACT I,_Renier._ I'll question her.
825,ACT I,
826,ACT I,"_Vittia._                    Blindly, and peril all?"
827,ACT I,
828,ACT I,"_Renier._ I will return. You put me off, and off."
829,ACT I,
830,ACT I,"(_By the loggia, with_ MORO,"
831,ACT I,_he goes; the slave slips out_.
832,ACT I,"YOLANDA _enters, sadly her gaze on"
833,ACT I,"the floor. She walks slowly, but"
834,ACT I,"becoming conscious starts, sees_"
835,ACT I,"VITTIA, _and turns to withdraw._)"
836,ACT I,
837,ACT I,_Vittia._ Your pardon--
838,ACT I,
839,ACT I,_Yolanda._              I can serve you?
840,ACT I,
841,ACT I,_Vittia._                                If you seek
842,ACT I,"The women, they are gone."
843,ACT I,
844,ACT I,_Yolanda._                I do not seek them.
845,ACT I,
846,ACT I,_Vittia._ Nor me?
847,ACT I,
848,ACT I,_Yolanda._        Nor any.--Yet I would I might
849,ACT I,With seeking penetrate the labyrinth
850,ACT I,Of your intent.
851,ACT I,
852,ACT I,"_Vittia._       I thank you. And you shall,"
853,ACT I,To-night--if you have love.
854,ACT I,
855,ACT I,_Yolanda._                  That thread were vain.
856,ACT I,
857,ACT I,"_Vittia._ I say, if you have love."
858,ACT I,
859,ACT I,_Yolanda._                         Of guile?
860,ACT I,
861,ACT I,_Vittia._                                    Of her
862,ACT I,"You hold as mother, and who is Amaury's."
863,ACT I,
864,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Were it so simple, no design had ever"
865,ACT I,"Laired darkly in you, but to my eyes been clear"
866,ACT I,As shallows under Morpha's crystal wave.
867,ACT I,
868,ACT I,_Vittia._ Unproven you speak so.
869,ACT I,
870,ACT I,_Yolanda._                       And proven would.
871,ACT I,
872,ACT I,"_Vittia._ If so, then--save her."
873,ACT I,
874,ACT I,_Yolanda._                       Who? What do you--?
875,ACT I,
876,ACT I,_Vittia_ (_with irony_).                             Mean?
877,ACT I,It is not clear?
878,ACT I,
879,ACT I,_Yolanda._       Save her?
880,ACT I,
881,ACT I,_Vittia._                  The surety flies
882,ACT I,Out of your cheek and dead upon your heart:
883,ACT I,Yet you are innocent--oh innocent?--
884,ACT I,O'er what abyss she hangs!
885,ACT I,
886,ACT I,_Yolanda._                 O'er no abyss.
887,ACT I,
888,ACT I,_Vittia._ But to her lord is constant!
889,ACT I,
890,ACT I,_Yolanda_ (_desperate_).               She is constant.
891,ACT I,
892,ACT I,_Vittia._ And to his bed is true?
893,ACT I,
894,ACT I,_Yolanda._                        True.
895,ACT I,
896,ACT I,_Vittia._                               And this baron
897,ACT I,"Of Paphos--Camarin--is but her _friend_,"
898,ACT I,And deeply yours--as oft you feign to shield her?
899,ACT I,
900,ACT I,_Yolanda._ He is no more.
901,ACT I,
902,ACT I,"_Vittia._                 Your heart belies your lips,"
903,ACT I,Knows better than believing what you say.
904,ACT I,
905,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Were, were he then ... (_struggles_) Lord Renier knows"
906,ACT I,it not!
907,ACT I,And never must. I have misled his thought
908,ACT I,"From her to me. The danger thus may pass,"
909,ACT I,The open shame.
910,ACT I,"Sir Camarin departed, her release"
911,ACT I,From the remorse and fettering will seem
912,ACT I,Sweet as a vista into fairyland.
913,ACT I,For none e'er will betray her.
914,ACT I,
915,ACT I,_Vittia._                      None?
916,ACT I,
917,ACT I,_Yolanda._                           Your tone...!
918,ACT I,(_Realising with gradual horror._) The still insinuation! You would
919,ACT I,do it!
920,ACT I,This is the beast then of the labyrinth?
921,ACT I,And this your heart is?
922,ACT I,
923,ACT I,"_Vittia._               No, not ever: no."
924,ACT I,"But now, if you deny me."
925,ACT I,
926,ACT I,"_Yolanda._               Speak as a woman,"
927,ACT I,If there is Womanhood in you to speak.
928,ACT I,The name of Berengere Lusignan must
929,ACT I,"Go clean unto the years, fair and unsullied."
930,ACT I,Nor must the bloody leap
931,ACT I,"Of death fall on her from Lord Renier's sword,"
932,ACT I,A death too ready if he but suspect.
933,ACT I,"No, she is holy!"
934,ACT I,And holy are my lips
935,ACT I,Remembering that they may call her mother!
936,ACT I,"All the bright world I breathe because of her,"
937,ACT I,"Laughter and roses, day-song of the sea,"
938,ACT I,Not bitterness and loneliness and blight!
939,ACT I,"All the bright world,"
940,ACT I,"Of voices, dear as waking to the dead--"
941,ACT I,Voices of love and tender earthly hopes--
942,ACT I,"O, all the beauty I was once forbid!"
943,ACT I,"Yes, yes!--"
944,ACT I,"She lifted me, a lonely convent weed,"
945,ACT I,"A cloister thing unvisited of dew,"
946,ACT I,Withering and untended and afar
947,ACT I,"From the remembered ruin of my home,"
948,ACT I,And here has planted me in happiness.
949,ACT I,"Then, for her, all I am!"
950,ACT I,
951,ACT I,_Vittia._                Or--hope to be?
952,ACT I,
953,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ The price, say, of your silence.--I am weary."
954,ACT I,
955,ACT I,_Vittia._ And would be rid of me.
956,ACT I,
957,ACT I,"_Yolanda._                        The price, the price."
958,ACT I,
959,ACT I,_Vittia._ It is (_low and ashamed_) that you renounce Amaury's love.
960,ACT I,
961,ACT I,(_A pause._)
962,ACT I,
963,ACT I,_Yolanda._ Amaury's love.... You then would rend me there
964,ACT I,Where not Eternity could heal the wound
965,ACT I,Though all the River of God might be for balm!
966,ACT I,Cruelty like to this you could not do?
967,ACT I,
968,ACT I,(_Waits a moment._)
969,ACT I,
970,ACT I,A swallow on the battlements to-day
971,ACT I,Fell from the hawk: you soothed and set it free.
972,ACT I,"This, then, you would not--!"
973,ACT I,
974,ACT I,_Vittia._                    Yes.
975,ACT I,
976,ACT I,_Yolanda._                        You cannot!
977,ACT I,
978,ACT I,_Vittia._                                     Yes.
979,ACT I,
980,ACT I,_Yolanda_ (_wrung for a moment then calm_).
981,ACT I,"I had forgotten, you are of Venice--Venice"
982,ACT I,Whose burdening is vast upon this land.
983,ACT I,Good-night.
984,ACT I,
985,ACT I,_Vittia._   And you despise me!
986,ACT I,
987,ACT I,_Yolanda._                      More am sick
988,ACT I,That love of him has led your thought so low.
989,ACT I,To-morrow--
990,ACT I,
991,ACT I,_Vittia._   Not to-morrow! But you must
992,ACT I,Choose and at once.
993,ACT I,
994,ACT I,_Yolanda._          Then----
995,ACT I,
996,ACT I,(_They start and listen.
997,ACT I,Approaching hoofs are heard._)
998,ACT I,
999,ACT I,Vittia.                    Ah! Amaury?--It is?
1000,ACT I,His speed upon the road? now at the gates?
1001,ACT I,
1002,ACT I,(_The fall of chains is heard._)
1003,ACT I,
1004,ACT I,"What then, what is your purpose--to renounce"
1005,ACT I,"And force him from you, or to have me breathe"
1006,ACT I,To Renier Lusignan the one word
1007,ACT I,That will transmute his wrong to madness?
1008,ACT I,"Say quickly. Centuries have stained these walls,"
1009,ACT I,But never a wife; never----
1010,ACT I,
1011,ACT I,(_Enter_ BERENGERE.)
1012,ACT I,
1013,ACT I,_Yolanda._                  Mother?...
1014,ACT I,
1015,ACT I,_Berengere._                           Amaury
1016,ACT I,"Has spurred to us, Yolanda, from his post,"
1017,ACT I,Secret and sudden. But ... what has befallen?
1018,ACT I,
1019,ACT I,(_Looks from one to the other._)
1020,ACT I,
1021,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ He comes here, mother?"
1022,ACT I,
1023,ACT I,_Berengere._                      At once.
1024,ACT I,
1025,ACT I,_Yolanda._                                 No!
1026,ACT I,
1027,ACT I,"_Vittia_ (_coldly, to_ YOLANDA).               Then to-night"
1028,ACT I,Must be the end.
1029,ACT I,
1030,ACT I,"_Yolanda._       Go, go."
1031,ACT I,
1032,ACT I,_Berengere_ (_as Vittia passes out_). What thing is this?
1033,ACT I,
1034,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Mother, I cannot have him--here--Amaury!"
1035,ACT I,Defer him but a little--till to-morrow.
1036,ACT I,I cannot see him now.
1037,ACT I,
1038,ACT I,_Berengere._          This is o'erstrange.
1039,ACT I,
1040,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Help me to think. Go to him, go, and say"
1041,ACT I,Some woman thing--that I am ill--that I
1042,ACT I,"Am at confession--penance--that--Ah, say"
1043,ACT I,But anything!
1044,ACT I,
1045,ACT I,_Berengere._    Yolanda!
1046,ACT I,
1047,ACT I,_Yolanda._               Say.... No use.
1048,ACT I,Too late.
1049,ACT I,
1050,ACT I,_Berengere._ His step?
1051,ACT I,
1052,ACT I,"_Yolanda._             Oh, unmistakable;"
1053,ACT I,Along the corridor. There!
1054,ACT I,
1055,ACT I,(_The curtains are thrown back._)
1056,ACT I,
1057,ACT I,_Amaury_ (_at the threshold._) My Yolanda!
1058,ACT I,
1059,ACT I,"(_Hastens down and takes her,"
1060,ACT I,"passive, into his arms._ BERENGERE"
1061,ACT I,_goes._)
1062,ACT I,
1063,ACT I,"My, my Yolanda!"
1064,ACT I,"To touch you is as triumph to the blood,"
1065,ACT I,Is as the boon of battle to the strong!
1066,ACT I,
1067,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Amaury, no; release me and say why"
1068,ACT I,You come: The Saracens----?
1069,ACT I,
1070,ACT I,_Amaury._                   Not of them now!
1071,ACT I,
1072,ACT I,(_Bends back her head._)
1073,ACT I,
1074,ACT I,But of some tribute incense to this beauty!
1075,ACT I,Dear as the wind wafts from undying shrines
1076,ACT I,Of mystery and myrrh!
1077,ACT I,I'd have the eloquence of quickened moons
1078,ACT I,"Pouring upon the midnight magical,"
1079,ACT I,"To say all I have yearned,"
1080,ACT I,"Now, with your head pillowed upon my breast!"
1081,ACT I,"Slow sullen speech come to my soldier lips,"
1082,ACT I,"Rough with command, and impotent of softness?"
1083,ACT I,Come to my lips! or fill so full my eyes
1084,ACT I,"That the unutterable, shall seem as sweet"
1085,ACT I,"To my Yolanda. (_Lifting her face, with surprise._)"
1086,ACT I,But how now? tears?
1087,ACT I,
1088,ACT I,_Yolanda._                         Amaury----
1089,ACT I,
1090,ACT I,_Amaury._ What have I done? Too pitiless have pressed
1091,ACT I,You to this coat of steel?
1092,ACT I,
1093,ACT I,"_Yolanda._                 No, no."
1094,ACT I,
1095,ACT I,"_Amaury._                          My words,"
1096,ACT I,"Or silence, then?"
1097,ACT I,
1098,ACT I,"_Yolanda._        Amaury, no, but sweet,"
1099,ACT I,"Sweet as the roses of Damascus crusht,"
1100,ACT I,Your silence is! and sweeter than the dream
1101,ACT I,"Of April nightingale on Troados,"
1102,ACT I,"Or gushing by the springs of Chitria,"
1103,ACT I,"Your every word of love! Yet--yet--ah, fold me,"
1104,ACT I,"Within your arms oblivion and hold me,"
1105,ACT I,"Fast to your being press me, and there bless me"
1106,ACT I,With breathèd power of your manhood's might.
1107,ACT I,Amaury!...
1108,ACT I,
1109,ACT I,_Amaury._ This I cannot understand.
1110,ACT I,
1111,ACT I,_Yolanda_ (_freeing herself_). Nothing--a folly--groundless frailty.
1112,ACT I,
1113,ACT I,"_Amaury._ You've been again at some old tale of sorrow,"
1114,ACT I,
1115,ACT I,(_Goes to the lectern._)
1116,ACT I,
1117,ACT I,Pining along the pages of a book--
1118,ACT I,"This, telling of that Italy madonna"
1119,ACT I,Whose days were sad--I have forgotten how.
1120,ACT I,Is it not so?
1121,ACT I,
1122,ACT I,"_Yolanda._    No, no. The tears of women"
1123,ACT I,"Come as the air and sighing of the night,"
1124,ACT I,We know not whence or why.
1125,ACT I,
1126,ACT I,"_Amaury._                  Often, perhaps."
1127,ACT I,I am not skilled to tell. But these--not these!
1128,ACT I,They are of trouble known.
1129,ACT I,
1130,ACT I,_Yolanda._                 Yet now forget them.
1131,ACT I,
1132,ACT I,_Amaury._ It will not leave my heart that somehow--how
1133,ACT I,I cannot fathom--Camarin----
1134,ACT I,
1135,ACT I,"_Yolanda_ (_lightly, to stop him_). No farther!"
1136,ACT I,
1137,ACT I,_Amaury._ That Camarin of Paphos is their cause.
1138,ACT I,Tell me----
1139,ACT I,
1140,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Yes, that I love thee!"
1141,ACT I,
1142,ACT I,_Amaury._                          Tell me----
1143,ACT I,
1144,ACT I,_Yolanda._                                     Love thee!
1145,ACT I,As sea the sky! and as the sky the wind!
1146,ACT I,And as the wind the forest! As the forest--
1147,ACT I,"What does the forest love, Amaury? I"
1148,ACT I,Can think of nothing!
1149,ACT I,
1150,ACT I,_Amaury._             Tell me then you have
1151,ACT I,"Never a moment of you yielded to him,"
1152,ACT I,That never he has touched too long this hand--
1153,ACT I,"Till evermore he must, even as I--"
1154,ACT I,Nor once into your eyes too deep has gazed!
1155,ACT I,You falter? darken?
1156,ACT I,
1157,ACT I,_Yolanda._          Would he ne'er had come
1158,ACT I,"Into these halls! that it were beautiful,"
1159,ACT I,Holy to hate him as the Lost can hate.
1160,ACT I,
1161,ACT I,_Amaury._ But 'tis not?
1162,ACT I,
1163,ACT I,_Yolanda._               God shall judge him.
1164,ACT I,
1165,ACT I,_Amaury._                                     And not you?
1166,ACT I,
1167,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Though he is weak, there is within him--"
1168,ACT I,
1169,ACT I,_Amaury._                                            That
1170,ACT I,Which women trust? and you?
1171,ACT I,
1172,ACT I,(BERENGERE _enters. He turns to
1173,ACT I,her._)
1174,ACT I,
1175,ACT I,Mother?
1176,ACT I,
1177,ACT I,"_Berengere._                        A runner,"
1178,ACT I,A soldier of your troop within the forts
1179,ACT I,Has come with word.
1180,ACT I,
1181,ACT I,_Amaury_ (_starting_). Mother!
1182,ACT I,
1183,ACT I,_Berengere._                   It is ill news?
1184,ACT I,I've seen that battle-light in you before.
1185,ACT I,'Tis of the Saracens? you ride to-night
1186,ACT I,Into their peril?
1187,ACT I,
1188,ACT I,"_Amaury._               Come, the word, the word!"
1189,ACT I,
1190,ACT I,_Berengere._ Only this token.
1191,ACT I,
1192,ACT I,_Amaury._               The spur? the spur? (_Takes it._) They then
1193,ACT I,Are landing!
1194,ACT I,
1195,ACT I,"_Yolanda._    How, Amaury; tell your meaning!"
1196,ACT I,
1197,ACT I,_Amaury._ The galleys of the Saracens have found
1198,ACT I,Anchor and land to-night near Keryneia.
1199,ACT I,My troops are ready and await me--
1200,ACT I,"So, no delay."
1201,ACT I,
1202,ACT I,"_Yolanda._     I pray you (_strangely, with terror_) do not go."
1203,ACT I,
1204,ACT I,_Amaury._ Yolanda!
1205,ACT I,
1206,ACT I,_Yolanda._          If I am left alone--!
1207,ACT I,
1208,ACT I,_Amaury._                                 Yolanda!
1209,ACT I,
1210,ACT I,_Yolanda_ (_sinking to a seat_). I meant it not--a breath of
1211,ACT I,fear--no more.
1212,ACT I,"Go, go."
1213,ACT I,
1214,ACT I,_Amaury._ I know you not to-night. Farewell.
1215,ACT I,
1216,ACT I,(_He kisses her and hurries off....
1217,ACT I,A silence._)
1218,ACT I,
1219,ACT I,_Berengere._ Yolanda----
1220,ACT I,
1221,ACT I,"_Yolanda._                Mother, I will go to sleep."
1222,ACT I,
1223,ACT I,(_She rises._)
1224,ACT I,
1225,ACT I,_Berengere._ A change is over you--a difference
1226,ACT I,Drawn as a veil between us.
1227,ACT I,
1228,ACT I,_Yolanda._                  I am weary.
1229,ACT I,
1230,ACT I,_Berengere._ You love me?
1231,ACT I,
1232,ACT I,"_Yolanda._                As, O mother, I love him,"
1233,ACT I,"With love impregnable to every ill,"
1234,ACT I,As Paradise is.
1235,ACT I,
1236,ACT I,_Berengere._     Then--
1237,ACT I,
1238,ACT I,"_Yolanda._              I pray, no more."
1239,ACT I,To-night I am flooded with a deeper tide
1240,ACT I,Than yet has flowed into my life--and through it
1241,ACT I,Sounds premonition: so I must have calm.
1242,ACT I,
1243,ACT I,(_She embraces_ BERENGERE; _goes
1244,ACT I,slowly up steps and off._)
1245,ACT I,
1246,ACT I,_Berengere_ (_chilled_). What fear--if it is fear--has so unfixed her?
1247,ACT I,It is suspicion--Then I must not meet
1248,ACT I,"Him here to-night--or if to-night, no more."
1249,ACT I,Her premonition!--and my dream that I
1250,ACT I,Should with a cross bring her deep bitterness.
1251,ACT I,
1252,ACT I,"(_Thinks a moment, then takes the"
1253,ACT I,crucifix from her neck._)
1254,ACT I,
1255,ACT I,"Had Renier but come, perhaps I might ..."
1256,ACT I,
1257,ACT I,(_Lays it on table._)
1258,ACT I,
1259,ACT I,O were I dead this sinning would awake me?...
1260,ACT I,"And yet I care not (_dully._) ... No, I will forget."
1261,ACT I,
1262,ACT I,(_Goes firmly from door to
1263,ACT I,door and looks out each. Then
1264,ACT I,"lifts, uniting, the cross-shaped"
1265,ACT I,candlestick; and waving it at the
1266,ACT I,"loggia, turns holding it before"
1267,ACT I,her._)
1268,ACT I,
1269,ACT I,"Soon he will come up from the cool, and touch"
1270,ACT I,Away my weakness with mad tenderness.
1271,ACT I,Soon he will ... Ah!
1272,ACT I,
1273,ACT I,(_Has seen with terror the
1274,ACT I,candlestick's structure._)
1275,ACT I,
1276,ACT I,The cross!... My dream!... Yolanda!
1277,ACT I,
1278,ACT I,(_Lets it fall._)
1279,ACT I,
1280,ACT I,"Mercy of God, move in me!... Sacrilege!"
1281,ACT I,
1282,ACT I,
1283,ACT I,"(_Sinks feebly to the divan, and"
1284,ACT I,"bows, overcome._)"
1285,ACT I,
1286,ACT I,_Camarin_ (_appearing after a pause an the loggia_).
1287,ACT I,"My Berengere, a moment, and I come!"
1288,ACT I,
1289,ACT I,"(_Enters, locking the grating"
1290,ACT I,"behind him, Then he hurries down"
1291,ACT I,and leans to lift her face._)
1292,ACT I,
1293,ACT I,"_Berengere._ No, no! nor ever, ever again, for ever!"
1294,ACT I,
1295,ACT I,(_Shrinks._)
1296,ACT I,
1297,ACT I,Go from me and behind leave no farewell....
1298,ACT I,
1299,ACT I,"_Camarin._ This is--illusion. In the dew I've waited,"
1300,ACT I,And the night's song of you is in my brain--
1301,ACT I,A song that seems----
1302,ACT I,
1303,ACT I,_Berengere._          Withhold from words. At last
1304,ACT I,"Fate is begun! See, with the cross it was"
1305,ACT I,I waved you hither. Leave me--let me pass
1306,ACT I,Out of this sin--and to repentance--after.
1307,ACT I,
1308,ACT I,"_Camarin._ I cannot, cannot!"
1309,ACT I,
1310,ACT I,"_Berengere._                 Pity, then, my fear."
1311,ACT I,"This moment were it known would end with murder,"
1312,ACT I,"Or did it not, dishonour still would kill!"
1313,ACT I,"Leave, leave."
1314,ACT I,
1315,ACT I,"_Camarin._    To-morrow, then; but not to-night!"
1316,ACT I,
1317,ACT I,(_He goes behind and puts his arms
1318,ACT I,around her._)
1319,ACT I,
1320,ACT I,"Give me thy being once again, thy beauty."
1321,ACT I,For it I'm mad as bacchanals for wine.
1322,ACT I,
1323,ACT I,"(YOLANDA, _entering an the balcony,"
1324,ACT I,"hears, and would retreat, but sees_"
1325,ACT I,RENIER _come to the grating._)
1326,ACT I,
1327,ACT I,Once more be to me all that woman may!
1328,ACT I,Let us again take rapture wings and rise
1329,ACT I,"Up to our world of love, guilt would unsphere."
1330,ACT I,Let us live over days that passed as streams
1331,ACT I,"Limpid by lotus-banks unto the sea,"
1332,ACT I,O'er all the whispered nights that we have clasped
1333,ACT I,Knowing the heights and all the deeps of passion!
1334,ACT I,"But speak, and we shall be amid the stars."
1335,ACT I,
1336,ACT I,(RENIER _draws a dagger and leaves
1337,ACT I,the grating. With a low cry_
1338,ACT I,YOLANDA _staggers down: the Two
1339,ACT I,"rise, fearful._)"
1340,ACT I,
1341,ACT I,_Berengere._ Yolanda!
1342,ACT I,
1343,ACT I,"_Yolanda._            Mother, mother!... Ah, his eyes!"
1344,ACT I,
1345,ACT I,_Berengere._ What brings you here--to spy upon me?
1346,ACT I,
1347,ACT I,_Yolanda._                                         Listen!...
1348,ACT I,"Think not of me--no, hush--but of the peril"
1349,ACT I,Arisen up.... Your husband!
1350,ACT I,
1351,ACT I,_Camarin._                  Renier?
1352,ACT I,
1353,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Was at that grating--heard. And from its sheath,"
1354,ACT I,"A dagger--! Ah, he will come."
1355,ACT I,
1356,ACT I,_Berengere_ (_weakly_).          What does she say?
1357,ACT I,
1358,ACT I,"_Yolanda._ Find calmness now, and some expedient."
1359,ACT I,
1360,ACT I,(_She struggles to think._)
1361,ACT I,
1362,ACT I,_Berengere._ I cannot die.

1671,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Has not returned.
1672,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,

1708,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_They start._ VITTIA _enters from
1709,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,castle._)
1710,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1711,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Lady, I will go in."
1712,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1713,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Alessa._           And I; to wait.
1714,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1715,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_They go._)
1716,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1717,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_suddenly_). But I to see Amaury.
1718,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1719,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Vittia._                                    What?
1720,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1721,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Stops._)
1722,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1723,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._                                         To see,"
1724,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Vittia Visani, who withholds Amaury----"
1725,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Who came last night at dusk, as well you know."
1726,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1727,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"(_They face, opposed._)"
1728,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1729,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,What have you told him?
1730,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1731,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Vittia._               Hah?
1732,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1733,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._                   Insolence, false"
1734,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And feigning! But no matter; lies are brief.
1735,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I'll go myself to him.
1736,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1737,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Vittia._              To be repelled?
1738,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1739,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(BERENGERE _enters._)
1740,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1741,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._ If he could trust you--but he could not.
1742,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1743,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Vittia._                                           Knowing
1744,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,A Paphian ere this has fondled two?
1745,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1746,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._ You hear, mother? (_To Vittia._) Out of my way at once."
1747,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1748,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Berengere._ Stay, stay! She has not told him! nothing!... Yes,"
1749,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I too have been aware and kept you blind.
1750,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"But, nothing! for he still is overworn."
1751,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And now his wound----
1752,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1753,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                      Wound! he is wounded?
1754,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1755,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                                          He sleeps.
1756,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1757,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._ And is in danger--jeopardy?
1758,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1759,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                           In none;
1760,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,If the leech Tremitus has any skill;
1761,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And that you know.
1762,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1763,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._         I thank ... Madonna ... thee!
1764,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1765,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(VITTIA _laughs and goes._)
1766,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1767,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"But you, mother, are come at last to say"
1768,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Your promises, broken two days, are kept?"
1769,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You've spoken? won Lord Renier to wisdom?
1770,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Pled him to silence which alone can save us?
1771,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Dear mother----?
1772,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1773,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._     Do not call me so again.
1774,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1775,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Turns away._)
1776,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1777,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I have not--and I will not.
1778,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1779,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                  Oh!
1780,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1781,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                    I cannot....
1782,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1783,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._ But can leave me so laden here within
1784,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,This gulf's dishonour? Never!... So return
1785,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And pledge him but to wait!
1786,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"For this Venetian has now, I bode,"
1787,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Something of evil more,"
1788,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,When once Amaury hears all that has passed.
1789,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Return!
1790,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1791,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._ I cannot.
1792,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1793,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda_ (_proudly_). Then hear, hear me! I"
1794,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Too am a woman, and the woman wants,"
1795,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,The beauty and ache and dream and glow and urge
1796,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of an unreckoned love are mine as yours.
1797,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I will not lose Amaury; but will tell him
1798,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Myself the truth.
1799,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1800,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Berengere._      Then--I'll not stay for death,"
1801,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And wait for shame. But now with Camarin
1802,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Will go from here.
1803,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1804,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._         Mother!
1805,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1806,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._               To some retreat
1807,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Away!
1808,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1809,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._ Where still pursuit would follow! even,"
1810,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"I fear, Amaury's!--"
1811,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And overtake you though it were as far
1812,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"As the sea foams, or past the sandy void"
1813,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of stricken Africa. It would be vain.
1814,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Vain, and I cannot have you. No, but listen----"
1815,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1816,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"(_Breaks off seeing_ RENIER, _on"

1820,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1821,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ She troubles you too much.
1822,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1823,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                         My lord?
1824,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1825,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                                     Too much.
1826,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You cherish her and reap unchastity
1827,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,For gratitude--unchastity against
1828,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Our very son who was betrothed to her.
1829,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Yet see her shameless.
1830,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1831,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere_ (_dully_). No; I think you wrong her.
1832,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1833,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(YOLANDA _moves apart._)
1834,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1835,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ Nobly you pity! But it will not veil her.
1836,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Rather the convent and the crucifix,"
1837,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Matin and Vesper in a round remote,"
1838,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"And senseless beads, for such.--But what more now"
1839,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Is she demanding?
1840,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1841,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._      Little.
1842,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1843,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                 Not the means
1844,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Still to deceive Amaury?
1845,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1846,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._             Renier ... no.
1847,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1848,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Speaks loathly._)
1849,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1850,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"But I have a request that, if you grant,"
1851,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Will lead peace back to us ... and from us draw
1852,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,This fang of fate.
1853,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1854,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._          Ah.
1855,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1856,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._           Yes.
1857,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1858,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier_ (_slowly_).        And we might be
1859,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,As those that wedded love?
1860,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1861,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._               Perhaps.
1862,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1863,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                           That--love!
1864,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1865,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_A pause._)
1866,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1867,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Then it shall be, at once ... But no, I first"
1868,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Have a confession.
1869,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1870,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._       You?
1871,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1872,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._               A pang!--For days

1874,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Takes her hand._)
1875,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1876,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Before I found Yolanda on the breast
1877,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of Camarin of Paphos----
1878,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I suffered in the furnace of suspicion
1879,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,The fume and suffocation of the thought
1880,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,That you were the guilty one--you my own wife.
1881,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1882,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"(_She recoils to_ YOLANDA, _who"

1884,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1885,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"I did; but rue, rue it!..."
1886,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,... Yet--it is just
1887,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,That you recoil even as now you do
1888,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,From stain upon your wedded constancy....
1889,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,But Time that is e'er-pitiful may pass
1890,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Soon over it--
1891,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And leave only forgiveness. And perhaps
1892,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Then I shall win you as I never have.--
1893,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Now the request.
1894,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1895,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._     That now ... I cannot plead.
1896,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1897,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Sees_ YOLANDA _harden. Is

1901,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Amaury may not know of this ... not know
1902,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,This trouble fallen from a night or evil--
1903,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Pitiless on us as a meteor's ash.
1904,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1905,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ Not of it? he? not know?
1906,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1907,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                       Trust to me.
1908,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1909,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                                       How!
1910,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And to this wanton's perfidy to bind
1911,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Him witless to her--with a charm perhaps--
1912,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Or, past releasing, with a philtre? She"
1913,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Whom now he holds pure as a spirit sped
1914,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"From immortality, or the fair fields"
1915,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Of the sun, to be his bride?"
1916,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1917,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._                   Sir, no!... She means"
1918,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Not I shall wed him! (_Winningly._) Only that you spare
1919,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To separate us with this horror; that
1920,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"You trust me to dispel his love, to pall"
1921,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And chill his passion from me. For I crave
1922,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Only one thing--innocence in his sight.
1923,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Believe!--believe!
1924,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1925,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._          I will--that you are mad.
1926,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Yet madder I, if to this coil my brain"
1927,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Were blind.
1928,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1929,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._ As it will be! with deadlier dark,"
1930,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,If you attend me not!
1931,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And may have destiny you cannot know.
1932,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,But you will heed?
1933,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,For somewhere in you there is tenderness.
1934,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Once when you chafed in fever and I bore
1935,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,White orange blossoms dewy to your pillow
1936,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"You touched my hand gently, as might a father."
1937,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1938,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Caresses his._)
1939,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1940,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Once on the tower when alone at dusk
1941,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"I sang--I know not why--of lost delights,"
1942,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of vanished roses that are ere recalling
1943,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"May to the world, you came and suddenly"
1944,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Lifted my brow up silent to your kiss.
1945,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Ah, you remember; you will hear me?"
1946,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1947,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                           No!
1948,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Though you are cunning.--Thus you wove the mesh
1949,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,About Amaury--till he could not move
1950,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Beyond you.
1951,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1952,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._ For his sake I ask it.
1953,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1954,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                          For
1955,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,No sake but to o'ersway him with your eyes
1956,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"In secret, thus, and with"
1957,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Your hair that he believes an aureole
1958,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Brought with you out of Heaven.
1959,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1960,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._                          Again--wrong.
1961,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1962,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Renier._ So deem you and, my Berengere, I grieve,"
1963,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Desiring much your peace.
1964,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1965,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._              It grieves you not.
1966,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1967,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ Then not! and half I fear--you here?--it should not.
1968,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,There's midnight in this thing and mystery.
1969,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Does she not love--Camarin?
1970,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1971,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_trembling_).    Say no more.
1972,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Be all--all as you will.
1973,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1974,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                That brings you low:
1975,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,But brings to me no light--only again
1976,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,The stumbling in suspicion.
1977,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1978,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                  It should not.
1979,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,

1988,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1989,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Renier._ What, what?"
1990,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1991,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Berengere._          My lord, she knows not what she says."
1992,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,The unaccustomed wind of these ill hours
1993,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Has torn tranquillity from her and reason.
1994,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
1995,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda_ (_realising_). Yes, as she says--tranquillity and reason."
1996,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,

2009,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._             Life is fear.
2010,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,No step was ever taken in the world
2011,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"But from a brink of danger, or in flight"
2012,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,From happiness whose air is ever sin.
2013,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,It sickens me.
2014,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,

2017,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._           Nothing; a pain

2019,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2020,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._         And it is all through him

2033,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,A flawless courtesy! as 'twere a king's.
2034,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Can he not smile too on his handiwork?
2035,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Our days were merciful and he has made
2036,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Each moment's beat a blow upon the breast.
2037,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Honour was here and innocence lies now
2038,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,A sacrifice that pain cannot consume.
2039,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2040,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Pauses._)
2041,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2042,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._ Or death.
2043,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2044,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._           Then have you not, unshameable!"
2045,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,A help for it or healing? you who know
2046,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,So well the world and its unwonted ways!
2047,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"A man would have, a man."
2048,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2049,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._               And I am barren.
2050,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,My brain an arid waste under remorse.
2051,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Only--one thing it yields--the love of her
2052,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,My love has made unholy.
2053,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2054,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._               While to me
2055,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"The shame is left, and silence--no defence,"
2056,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"When it is told Amaury, ""See her you"
2057,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Blest with betrothal and the boon of faith,"
2058,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Chose as the planet-mate of your proud star!
2059,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"While, in the battle,"
2060,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You with the weal of Cyprus on your brow
2061,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Dared momently peril,"
2062,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"We found her"" ... Ah, the memory is fire!----"
2063,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I will not bear it.
2064,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2065,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._          Then how? What?... You must.
2066,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Though for your suffering I am pitiful.
2067,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You must! (_Takes her wrist._)
2068,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"For to one thing, one only now I'm bent----"
2069,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,That Berengere be saved.
2070,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2071,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._             To-day ... no more.
2072,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2073,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._ Suspicion and the peril-feet of shame
2074,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I must keep from her still.
2075,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2076,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                  Though driven o'er
2077,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,My heart they trample the lone flower of hope.
2078,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2079,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"(_Shaking off his hand, then,"
2080,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,unnaturally wrought up._)
2081,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2082,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And even now perhaps Amaury hears
2083,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2084,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And turns away in horror!
2085,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2086,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Camarin._                What? Come, come."
2087,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Enough is here without----
2088,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2089,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_as before_). I'll go to him!
2090,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Despite of them! in to his side and say
2091,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,That I am innocent--as the first dawn
2092,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And dew of Eden!... Yes!
2093,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2094,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._               A frenzy! Mere
2095,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Folly! you wander!
2096,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2097,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_listening_). Whose that anguish? whose?
2098,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2099,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._ Amaury still is many leagues away--
2100,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2101,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Hassan appears._)
2102,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2103,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,At Keryneia! Do you hear me?
2104,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2105,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                   Hassan!
2106,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2107,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Is numb as he hurries down from
2108,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,the castle to her. A pause; then
2109,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,her voice falls hoarsely._)
2110,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2111,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"I hear you, speak. His wounds I know. The rest!"
2112,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,They've told him?
2113,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2114,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Hassan._         The Venetian, who nurst him"
2115,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Last night, pouring his potions--"
2116,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,She and Lord Renier. They broke his sleep.
2117,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,He listened to them as one in a grave.
2118,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Then they besought of him
2119,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Some oath against you, were they right: he would not."
2120,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Now he has risen,"
2121,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Silent and pale and suffering in leash.
2122,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,He's coming here.
2123,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2124,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Camarin._        Why, you are mad!"
2125,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2126,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                          Be still.
2127,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2128,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._ Amaury was not then delayed? is--here?
2129,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2130,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Voices are heard perturbed within
2131,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"the castle. Then_ AMAURY, _putting"
2132,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"aside_ RENIER _and_ TREMITUS,"
2133,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_followed by_ VITTIA _and others,"
2134,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,enters down._)
2135,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2136,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._ I'll not return unto my couch though twice
2137,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,These wounds and all your wants were urging it!
2138,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Yolanda! my Yolanda!--Never, never!"
2139,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2140,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Takes her to him._)
2141,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2142,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Until I prove you that a word against
2143,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Her that I hold here in my arms is more
2144,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To me than any peril.
2145,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2146,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Tremitus._           But, sir--!... Aeih!"
2147,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,My precious physic wasted!
2148,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2149,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._                  Till I prove it!
2150,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,For ... my Yolanda!...
2151,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You who are purity if Mary still
2152,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Is mother of God and lighteth Paradise!
2153,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You in whose presence I am purged as one
2154,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Bathing a thousand years in angel song!
2155,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"They say, you, who are stainless to my eyes"
2156,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"As is the sacring-bell to holy ears,"
2157,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,So undefiled even the perfect lily
2158,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Pendant upon your breast fears to pollute it!
2159,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Listen, they tell me you--A fool, a fool"
2160,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Would know it unbelievable and laugh.
2161,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2162,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ As now a fool is doing?
2163,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2164,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Amaury._                         O, sir, pardon."
2165,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"You are my father, and, I must believe,"
2166,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Mean well this monster breath's unchastity,"
2167,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,As does this lady (_of_ VITTIA) who has gently nursed me.
2168,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,But you were tricked; it was illusion swum
2169,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Before your sleep. Therefore my purpose is
2170,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Now to forget it.
2171,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2172,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Tremitus._       Aeih! and to return
2173,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Now to my drugs.
2174,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2175,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._        Stand off!--As dogs forget
2176,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,The lash in hunger of the wonted bone?
2177,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2178,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Laughs angrily._)
2179,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2180,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._ A poison so incredible and dark
2181,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You cannot duped innoculate me with.
2182,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Trust in my veins makes of it but more love.
2183,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And to dispel your minds (_goes to_ CAMARIN) I'll clasp his hand
2184,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Whom you have so accused.
2185,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2186,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Vittia._                 O do, my lord!"
2187,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2188,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Smiles disdainfully._)
2189,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2190,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,And then embrace him in whose arms three nights
2191,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Ago she was embraced.
2192,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2193,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_to her_). Can you so say!
2194,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2195,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Vittia._ Yes, and will add----"
2196,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2197,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Amaury._                       Lady of Venice, nothing!"
2198,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"But this to all, I answer!--"
2199,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"There is my mother, see,"
2200,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Wounded with wonder of this plight, and pity."
2201,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Yolanda has dwelt by her
2202,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,As the fawn
2203,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,By the white doe on mount Chionodes.
2204,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I would as quick believe that she had given
2205,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Her holiness up to contamination
2206,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,As that Yolanda----
2207,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2208,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._          Amaury, enough!... I know!"
2209,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2210,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._ As quickly!
2211,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2212,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._            Then ... quell this delirium!
2213,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2214,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_A pause._)
2215,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2216,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Out of your thought forever let it fall,"
2217,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Hear no more of it, ever!"
2218,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Be deaf to it as to a taunt of doom,"
2219,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"In triple mail to every peaceless word,"
2220,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Granite against even its memory.
2221,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Say that you will, and now!..."
2222,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2223,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                      So that you may
2224,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Allure him yet to wed you?
2225,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2226,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._                  Sir!
2227,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2228,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                       She would.
2229,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2230,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._ No, no! But let him.... Then I will go far"
2231,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Away from here to any alien air,"
2232,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"To opiate India, a lost sea-isle!"
2233,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To the last peak of arid Caucasus.
2234,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2235,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ With Camarin of Paphos?
2236,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2237,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                        With whoever
2238,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Your peace and this compelling pain ... Ah no!
2239,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2240,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Renier._ With him, with him, I say?..."
2241,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2242,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._                                You drive and drain her.
2243,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To me her words shall be--me and no other.
2244,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,So my Yolanda now dissolve the cling
2245,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of this invisible but heavy hydra;
2246,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I've striven with it till no more I can.
2247,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,If any tare has been unseemly sown
2248,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Upon the April vision of our love,"
2249,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Say it at once that I may rend and fling it
2250,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Away from us. Say it!
2251,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2252,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._             Vainly implored.--
2253,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Yet ask her this, If she three nights ago----"
2254,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2255,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._ I will not so insult her----
2256,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2257,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Tremitus._                             Aeih----
2258,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2259,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                                        Insult?
2260,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,She knows what I would bid and does she hurl
2261,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Her soul in any disavowal?
2262,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2263,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._                     I
2264,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Will speak to her alone. Go all of you
2265,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,There to the fountain.
2266,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2267,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Yolanda._             Yes, Amaury, then"
2268,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,One searching of my face shall free your fear.
2269,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Alone, alone."
2270,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2271,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._     Still to befool him!
2272,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2273,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda_ (_warningly_).           Choose!
2274,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,I cannot suffer more of this.
2275,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2276,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._                     Nor I
2277,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To breathe ever the burning of this mist
2278,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Of anguish and insatiate accusal.--
2279,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"This wound upon my throat, fever it not"
2280,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"With longer fire of doubt, Yolanda."
2281,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2282,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._                          Ah!
2283,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2284,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Berengere._ I am not well. I will go to my chamber.
2285,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2286,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_She passes into the castle._)
2287,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2288,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._ But I never until this guiler grants
2289,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"I found her in the arms of Camarin,"
2290,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Drinking the frenzied wine of passion he
2291,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Poured from his soul.
2292,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2293,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Amaury._             Yolanda?
2294,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2295,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Renier._                      She is silent;
2296,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Dumb to deny it.
2297,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2298,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Amaury._        But she will, she will."
2299,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,You've driven her with dread and awe.
2300,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2301,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Vittia_ (_lightly_).                 And truth?
2302,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2303,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"_Amaury._ Have wounded her. But do not fear, Yolanda,"
2304,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Fiercely disown.
2305,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2306,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._       Amaury ... it is true.
2307,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2308,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_He staggers slowly back._)
2309,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2310,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"No, no; I have not been faithless to you--"
2311,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Even a moment
2312,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,To the divinity of love high-altared
2313,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Here in my breast! to the immutable
2314,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Beauty of it!... look, look not on me so--"
2315,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"As I had struck, murdered a little child!"
2316,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,Or palsied one who put a hand to help me;
2317,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Or through eternity had desecrated,"
2318,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Vainly, virginity and trust and truth!"
2319,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"No, my Amaury! I ... do you not see?"
2320,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2321,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,(_Hysterically._)
2322,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2323,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"Not faithless, hear! it is not true! not true!"
2324,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,But only this----
2325,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2326,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._ Yolanda!
2327,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2328,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Yolanda._           I----
2329,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2330,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,_Camarin._                Yolanda!
2331,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,
2332,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,"(_A moment, then she sinks down,"
2333,SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED.,her face in her hands._ AMAURY

2337,CAMARIN.),CAMARIN.)
2338,CAMARIN.),
2339,CAMARIN.),_Amaury._ The day you first set step in Lusignan
2340,CAMARIN.),An image of the Magdalen within
2341,CAMARIN.),The chapel yonder fell--presaging this.
2342,CAMARIN.),"Only your death, your death or mine stands pale"

2348,CAMARIN.),"_Amaury._ Out, quickly."
2349,CAMARIN.),
2350,CAMARIN.),_Camarin._               Do your will. I'll put no more
2351,CAMARIN.),"To the guilt I bear, or to the misery"
2352,CAMARIN.),That guilt has brought upon you.
2353,CAMARIN.),
2354,CAMARIN.),_Amaury._                        Coward!

2357,CAMARIN.),
2358,CAMARIN.),_Amaury._ You play a part! (_Raves._) And 'tis that you may live
2359,CAMARIN.),Still in the love that you a thief have stolen.
2360,CAMARIN.),"So, with your steel----!"
2361,CAMARIN.),
2362,CAMARIN.),_Camarin._               It stays within its sheath.
2363,CAMARIN.),
2364,CAMARIN.),_Amaury._ Then I will not be thwarted though I must
2365,CAMARIN.),"Crush you as one a viper with his heel,"

2691,THE SAME DAY.,
2692,THE SAME DAY.,Unblushingly to one who knows--though by

2694,THE SAME DAY.,
2695,THE SAME DAY.,(_Turns away._)

2770,THE SAME DAY.,For a proof to her of any tie soever.
2771,THE SAME DAY.,
2772,THE SAME DAY.,
2773,THE SAME DAY.,(_He puts it on_ VITTIA'S _finger._)
2774,THE SAME DAY.,
2775,THE SAME DAY.,But now--for the sails make home along the sea--
2776,THE SAME DAY.,Now of my mother.
2777,THE SAME DAY.,
2778,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._         More, my lord?"
2779,THE SAME DAY.,
2780,THE SAME DAY.,_Amaury._                        This only;
2781,THE SAME DAY.,
2782,THE SAME DAY.,(SMARDA _glides in._)
2783,THE SAME DAY.,
2784,THE SAME DAY.,To-morrow ... Scythian!
2785,THE SAME DAY.,
2786,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._               Who! My lord?...
2787,THE SAME DAY.,
2788,THE SAME DAY.,"(_Sees the slave's look, which"
2789,THE SAME DAY.,stirs him._)
2790,THE SAME DAY.,
2791,THE SAME DAY.,Smarda!
2792,THE SAME DAY.,Why are you here?... Those papers--but your lips!
2793,THE SAME DAY.,
2794,THE SAME DAY.,(_Takes the papers._)
2795,THE SAME DAY.,
2796,THE SAME DAY.,Not these alone have brought you thus; then what?
2797,THE SAME DAY.,
2798,THE SAME DAY.,(_Follows_ SMARDA'S _eye._)
2799,THE SAME DAY.,
2800,THE SAME DAY.,Of lord Amaury?
2801,THE SAME DAY.,
2802,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._       Of his mother.
2803,THE SAME DAY.,
2804,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                       How!
2805,THE SAME DAY.,
2806,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._ She swooned of terror at the castle gate.
2807,THE SAME DAY.,She lies in danger. Hear--'twas as she fled
2808,THE SAME DAY.,The lord of Lusignan.
2809,THE SAME DAY.,
2810,THE SAME DAY.,_Amaury._             My father?
2811,THE SAME DAY.,
2812,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._                        He.
2813,THE SAME DAY.,"And you are sought below, I heard it said:"
2814,THE SAME DAY.,Some officer of Famagouste--and men.
2815,THE SAME DAY.,
2816,THE SAME DAY.,(AMAURY _turns dazed and goes._)
2817,THE SAME DAY.,
2818,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia_      (_with fervour, then--yet awed_)."
2819,THE SAME DAY.,This is again fortune!... fortune!
2820,THE SAME DAY.,
2821,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._                          Lady?
2822,THE SAME DAY.,
2823,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._ Is! though an instant since it seemed disaster.
2824,THE SAME DAY.,
2825,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._ And how?
2826,THE SAME DAY.,
2827,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._          Yolanda, does she know?"
2828,THE SAME DAY.,
2829,THE SAME DAY.,_Smarda._                                  Nothing.
2830,THE SAME DAY.,Nothing. She was returning from the rocks
2831,THE SAME DAY.,Where nest the windy gulls (_gloatingly_)
2832,THE SAME DAY.,As I came hither. I stole there at noon
2833,THE SAME DAY.,To see her suffer.
2834,THE SAME DAY.,
2835,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._          Then.--I can compel her.
2836,THE SAME DAY.,"She will come here. Go to the curtains, see."
2837,THE SAME DAY.,"If she is near, the Paphian is in"
2838,THE SAME DAY.,"The bower by the cypress: go, tell him,"
2839,THE SAME DAY.,_The loggia--at once ..._ Ah!
2840,THE SAME DAY.,
2841,THE SAME DAY.,(YOLANDA _enters._)
2842,THE SAME DAY.,
2843,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda_ (_to herself_).      ""Ah"" indeed."
2844,THE SAME DAY.,
2845,THE SAME DAY.,(_Her look of purpose changes to
2846,THE SAME DAY.,one of distrust. But she firmly
2847,THE SAME DAY.,"fronts to_ VITTIA, _as the slave"
2848,THE SAME DAY.,slips out._)
2849,THE SAME DAY.,
2850,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._   My gratitude! I wished, and you are here."
2851,THE SAME DAY.,
2852,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._ And--for some reason of less honour--you.
2853,THE SAME DAY.,
2854,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._   I, a dear guest? fa!"
2855,THE SAME DAY.,
2856,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                       Were you! and not one
2857,THE SAME DAY.,This ne'er-before-envenomed air would banish.
2858,THE SAME DAY.,(_Slowly_) One whose abiding
2859,THE SAME DAY.,These walls would loathe aloud--had they a tongue
2860,THE SAME DAY.,To utter.
2861,THE SAME DAY.,
2862,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._ Yet I may be mistress of them,"
2863,THE SAME DAY.,Ere all is done--since still it is my purpose.
2864,THE SAME DAY.,
2865,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._ Gulfs wide as the hate of God for infamy
2866,THE SAME DAY.,Would lie preventing; so there is no fear.
2867,THE SAME DAY.,
2868,THE SAME DAY.,(_Sits._)
2869,THE SAME DAY.,
2870,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._ A prophesy!
2871,THE SAME DAY.,
2872,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._             A deeper than disdain.
2873,THE SAME DAY.,
2874,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._ Or than your love of Camarin of Paphos!
2875,THE SAME DAY.,
2876,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda._ Which you would feign, but cannot."
2877,THE SAME DAY.,
2878,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._                                     Still, before"
2879,THE SAME DAY.,"Evening is done, you will become his wife?"
2880,THE SAME DAY.,
2881,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda._   If, ere it come, all under Lusignan"
2882,THE SAME DAY.,Do not look scorn on Vittia Pisani.
2883,THE SAME DAY.,
2884,THE SAME DAY.,(_Rises._)
2885,THE SAME DAY.,
2886,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._ What! how?
2887,THE SAME DAY.,
2888,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._            Plentiful scorn! (_With joy._) A thing may still
2889,THE SAME DAY.,Be done to lift my hope out of this ruin!
2890,THE SAME DAY.,To bring Amaury grateful to my feet!
2891,THE SAME DAY.,And I will do it.
2892,THE SAME DAY.,
2893,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._         Tell?... vowing him first
2894,THE SAME DAY.,To win his father's lenience?... No ... I see!
2895,THE SAME DAY.,You would when she who's guilty
2896,THE SAME DAY.,And this enamoured Paphian are fled!
2897,THE SAME DAY.,
2898,THE SAME DAY.,(YOLANDA _turns pale._)
2899,THE SAME DAY.,
2900,THE SAME DAY.,When they are fled! ha ... And it is too late.
2901,THE SAME DAY.,
2902,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._ Too--? You by some trick--a trick have--!
2903,THE SAME DAY.,
2904,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                                              Hindered? Little
2905,THE SAME DAY.,"I needed ... Her wings are flightless. She is ill,"
2906,THE SAME DAY.,Verging--go learn!--to death.
2907,THE SAME DAY.,
2908,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                    No!
2909,THE SAME DAY.,
2910,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                         To the grave.
2911,THE SAME DAY.,"And you alone, she knows, can put it far--"
2912,THE SAME DAY.,Since she is numbed and drained
2913,THE SAME DAY.,"Momently by the terror of her husband,"
2914,THE SAME DAY.,Whose every pulse seems to her a suspicion.
2915,THE SAME DAY.,
2916,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._ And it is you ... you who have urged again
2917,THE SAME DAY.,His doubt that would have sunk!
2918,THE SAME DAY.,
2919,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                       It was enough
2920,THE SAME DAY.,Merely to sigh--and fear her innocence
2921,THE SAME DAY.,Can only seem simple again as dew
2922,THE SAME DAY.,If you wed freely Camarin of Paphos.
2923,THE SAME DAY.,
2924,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda._   And that, you could! though in her heart remorse"
2925,THE SAME DAY.,Trampled and tore!
2926,THE SAME DAY.,"Though with the wounds of battle he you ""love"""
2927,THE SAME DAY.,Is livid still.
2928,THE SAME DAY.,
2929,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._       And grieves?--Be comforted!
2930,THE SAME DAY.,For _he_ is--now security has come.
2931,THE SAME DAY.,
2932,THE SAME DAY.,(_Shows ring;_ YOLANDA _falls
2933,THE SAME DAY.,back._)
2934,THE SAME DAY.,
2935,THE SAME DAY.,"As _he_ is, do not fear."
2936,THE SAME DAY.,
2937,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._               Amaury!... Oh!
2938,THE SAME DAY.,"He is not! no, Amaury!... He? so soon?--"
2939,THE SAME DAY.,"Ah, you are merciless!"
2940,THE SAME DAY.,
2941,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._              Only aware
2942,THE SAME DAY.,How to compel your pity to my ends;
2943,THE SAME DAY.,For you will spare his mother.
2944,THE SAME DAY.,
2945,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda._                     Yielding--still,"
2946,THE SAME DAY.,And past all season of recovery?
2947,THE SAME DAY.,Shattering love for ever at my feet?
2948,THE SAME DAY.,"No, you are duped. For empty, cold are the veins"
2949,THE SAME DAY.,Now of submission in me; numb and dead
2950,THE SAME DAY.,"The pleading of it. And upon you, back,"
2951,THE SAME DAY.,I cast the burden of your cruelty.
2952,THE SAME DAY.,
2953,THE SAME DAY.,(_Slowly._)
2954,THE SAME DAY.,
2955,THE SAME DAY.,And--if she dies in terror of the lips
2956,THE SAME DAY.,Of Renier Lusignan--on your peace
2957,THE SAME DAY.,The guilt be!
2958,THE SAME DAY.,
2959,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._     No.
2960,THE SAME DAY.,
2961,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._   The heaping mass of horror!
2962,THE SAME DAY.,
2963,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia_ (_moved_). No, on her own; for she has sinned."
2964,THE SAME DAY.,
2965,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                                           And suffered!
2966,THE SAME DAY.,But you----
2967,THE SAME DAY.,
2968,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._   I say her own. I've done no crime.
2969,THE SAME DAY.,And you will wed him.
2970,THE SAME DAY.,
2971,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._            Were I Venetian!
2972,THE SAME DAY.,But am not; so remorse has come in you!
2973,THE SAME DAY.,There at the gates that guard your rest you hear
2974,THE SAME DAY.,"Dim now the risen phantom cries of it,"
2975,THE SAME DAY.,The presage beat of them like hungry hands
2976,THE SAME DAY.,That will o'erwhelm you!
2977,THE SAME DAY.,All that I could to spare her I have done;
2978,THE SAME DAY.,All that was duty and of love the most.
2979,THE SAME DAY.,But you it was who struck and kindled first
2980,THE SAME DAY.,Within Lord Renier fire of suspicion.
2981,THE SAME DAY.,Then yours the penance!
2982,THE SAME DAY.,
2983,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._               Liar!... ah ... enough.
2984,THE SAME DAY.,
2985,THE SAME DAY.,(_Recovers herself._)
2986,THE SAME DAY.,
2987,THE SAME DAY.,A babe I am so to be fed with fright.
2988,THE SAME DAY.,You--well I know--will not desert her thus
2989,THE SAME DAY.,To ... the medusa of his doubt.
2990,THE SAME DAY.,
2991,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                      I will not.
2992,THE SAME DAY.,
2993,THE SAME DAY.,(_With exultance._)
2994,THE SAME DAY.,
2995,THE SAME DAY.,"Will, will not, will not, will not!"
2996,THE SAME DAY.,But you it is--
2997,THE SAME DAY.,For in the worst that live there still is heaven!--
2998,THE SAME DAY.,Must null his doubt and ease the sobbing ebb
2999,THE SAME DAY.,And flood of her sick spirit; you who must
3000,THE SAME DAY.,Go to his fear and with persuasion say
3001,THE SAME DAY.,That it is folly of him and of you
3002,THE SAME DAY.,"So to suspect her, since in Camarin's"
3003,THE SAME DAY.,Arms I was found. You will!
3004,THE SAME DAY.,
3005,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                   And--then go pray?
3006,THE SAME DAY.,
3007,THE SAME DAY.,(_Draws out the papers scornfully._)
3008,THE SAME DAY.,
3009,THE SAME DAY.,Rather I'll bring you this:--Authority
3010,THE SAME DAY.,Sent me of Venice
3011,THE SAME DAY.,"To make Amaury lordly over Cyprus,"
3012,THE SAME DAY.,Or to abase him even of Famagouste;
3013,THE SAME DAY.,Which I will do--
3014,THE SAME DAY.,
3015,THE SAME DAY.,(_Goes to her._)
3016,THE SAME DAY.,
3017,THE SAME DAY.,"Unless I have the pledge that you will wed,"
3018,THE SAME DAY.,"Though not to be his wife and free to leave him,"
3019,THE SAME DAY.,"This Paphian,"
3020,THE SAME DAY.,"And with him from Lusignan hence will pass,"
3021,THE SAME DAY.,
3022,THE SAME DAY.,(CAMARIN _appears on loggia._)
3023,THE SAME DAY.,
3024,THE SAME DAY.,And he has come now for your answer.
3025,THE SAME DAY.,
3026,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                           Here!
3027,THE SAME DAY.,In league with you! in this!
3028,THE SAME DAY.,
3029,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                    Most loyally;
3030,THE SAME DAY.,"And ready skilfully to disavow,"
3031,THE SAME DAY.,"With every force, your innocence--if you"
3032,THE SAME DAY.,Attempt betrayal!--
3033,THE SAME DAY.,"Enter, my lord of Paphos--"
3034,THE SAME DAY.,
3035,THE SAME DAY.,
3036,THE SAME DAY.,(CAMARIN _enters desperately._)
3037,THE SAME DAY.,
3038,THE SAME DAY.,I have spoken.
3039,THE SAME DAY.,She has not pledged to wed you--though the life
3040,THE SAME DAY.,"Of Berengere Lusignan fall for it,"
3041,THE SAME DAY.,And though Amaury ... But you may avail.

3047,THE SAME DAY.,
3048,THE SAME DAY.,"_Camarin._ As an anchorite for immortality,"
3049,THE SAME DAY.,"Venetian, I covet this--covet!"
3050,THE SAME DAY.,Yet ... I will not entreat it of her.
3051,THE SAME DAY.,
3052,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                             What!
3053,THE SAME DAY.,
3054,THE SAME DAY.,"_Camarin._ I swore in dread, but will not!"
3055,THE SAME DAY.,
3056,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                                  Now!
3057,THE SAME DAY.,
3058,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda_ (_low_).                              Madonna!
3059,THE SAME DAY.,
3060,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._ Now you refuse?
3061,THE SAME DAY.,
3062,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                He does--he does!
3063,THE SAME DAY.,
3064,THE SAME DAY.,_Vittia._                                   The whole?
3065,THE SAME DAY.,
3066,THE SAME DAY.,"_Yolanda._ Lady of Venice, yes; for very shame!"
3067,THE SAME DAY.,
3068,THE SAME DAY.,(_With grave joy._)
3069,THE SAME DAY.,
3070,THE SAME DAY.,"Bitterly tho' it be, he must, for shame!"
3071,THE SAME DAY.,Though he would waste the air of the world to keep
3072,THE SAME DAY.,The breath still in the veins
3073,THE SAME DAY.,"Of her his love so wronged,"
3074,THE SAME DAY.,He cannot ask me more than breast can bear
3075,THE SAME DAY.,Knowing I have already borne for her
3076,THE SAME DAY.,Infection worse than fetid marshes send
3077,THE SAME DAY.,From Mesaoria--
3078,THE SAME DAY.,Have lost the sky of love that I had arched
3079,THE SAME DAY.,"And all the stars of it. See, he is dumb!--"
3080,THE SAME DAY.,He cannot.
3081,THE SAME DAY.,
3082,THE SAME DAY.,_Camarin_ (_coldly_). No; but to your heart I leave her
3083,THE SAME DAY.,And to your pity.
3084,THE SAME DAY.,
3085,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._        Say not pity to me!
3086,THE SAME DAY.,
3087,THE SAME DAY.,(_The word overwhelms her anew._)
3088,THE SAME DAY.,
3089,THE SAME DAY.,"Am I not needy, fain of it, and can"

3091,THE SAME DAY.,What have I left
3092,THE SAME DAY.,Of joy to ripple in me or of light
3093,THE SAME DAY.,To sway me to forgetting--I to whom
3094,THE SAME DAY.,"Dawn was enchanted incense once, and day,"
3095,THE SAME DAY.,"The least of earth, an ides of heaven bliss."
3096,THE SAME DAY.,What to me left! to me!
3097,THE SAME DAY.,Who shepherded each happy flock of waves
3098,THE SAME DAY.,"Running with silvery foaming there to shore,"
3099,THE SAME DAY.,Who numbered the little leaves with laughing names
3100,THE SAME DAY.,"Out of my love,"
3101,THE SAME DAY.,"And quickened the winds with quicker winds of hope,"
3102,THE SAME DAY.,"That now are spent ... as summer waters,"
3103,THE SAME DAY.,Leaving my breast a torrent's barren bed.
3104,THE SAME DAY.,Pity and pity! ever pity! No.
3105,THE SAME DAY.,
3106,THE SAME DAY.,(_Enter_ HASSAN.)
3107,THE SAME DAY.,
3108,THE SAME DAY.,A nun to pity I will be no more.
3109,THE SAME DAY.,"But you, cruel Venetian ... Ah, ah,"
3110,THE SAME DAY.,Mother of God! is there no gentleness

3119,THE SAME DAY.,Then to compel you.
3120,THE SAME DAY.,
3121,THE SAME DAY.,"_Vittia._           Still, there is none."

3138,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                          Well?
3139,THE SAME DAY.,
3140,THE SAME DAY.,_Hassan._ There is a means--a might.
3141,THE SAME DAY.,
3142,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                           Well?

3145,THE SAME DAY.,
3146,THE SAME DAY.,_Hassan._                      To compel her.

3148,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._ To ... what?
3149,THE SAME DAY.,
3150,THE SAME DAY.,_Hassan._               If you will dare it.
3151,THE SAME DAY.,
3152,THE SAME DAY.,_Yolanda._                                   Will--?

3154,THE SAME DAY.,_Hassan._                                            I swear.
3155,THE SAME DAY.,

3158,THE SAME DAY.,_Hassan._                                        Then ... let me but
3159,THE SAME DAY.,Seize her and shut her fast an hour within

3367,ACT IV,"on one of them, halfway up, stands a stone image of the"

3563,ACT IV,_Amaury._          Set down the bier.
3564,ACT IV,
3565,ACT IV,(_It is placed._)
3566,ACT IV,
3567,ACT IV,_Moro._                               Lone rest!
3568,ACT IV,Then bliss Afar for ever!
3569,ACT IV,
3570,ACT IV,_Amaury_ (_rises_).       Be it so!
3571,ACT IV,
3572,ACT IV,(_Turning; brokenly._)
3573,ACT IV,
3574,ACT IV,"But unto any, mother, who have brought thee"
3575,ACT IV,"Low to this couch, be never ease again."
3576,ACT IV,"To any who have put thy life out, never!"
3577,ACT IV,But in them be the burning that has seemed
3578,ACT IV,To shrivel thee--whether with pain or fear!
3579,ACT IV,"And be appeaseless tears,"
3580,ACT IV,Salt tears that rust the fountain of the heart.
3581,ACT IV,
3582,ACT IV,(_Sinks to a seat. A pause._)
3583,ACT IV,
3584,ACT IV,"_Moro._ My son, relentless words."
3585,ACT IV,
3586,ACT IV,_Amaury_ (_up again_).            To the relentless!
3587,ACT IV,
3588,ACT IV,_Moro._ God hear you not!
3589,ACT IV,
3590,ACT IV,_Amaury._                  Then is He not my God.
3591,ACT IV,
3592,ACT IV,"_Moro._ Enough, enough. (_To the rest._) But go and for her soul"
3593,ACT IV,Freight all of you this tide of night with prayer.
3594,ACT IV,
3595,ACT IV,_Amaury._ Never!
3596,ACT IV,
3597,ACT IV,_Moro._    I bid.
3598,ACT IV,
3599,ACT IV,_Amaury._         And I forbid those who
3600,ACT IV,Have prized her not!
3601,ACT IV,"For though nought's in the world but prayer may move,"
3602,ACT IV,Still but the lips that loved her
3603,ACT IV,Should for her any sin beseeching lift.
3604,ACT IV,
3605,ACT IV,(_Looking at_ YOLANDA.)
3606,ACT IV,
3607,ACT IV,They and no other!
3608,ACT IV,
3609,ACT IV,"_Yolanda._         And, you mean----?"
3610,ACT IV,
3611,ACT IV,_Amaury._                             Not one.
3612,ACT IV,
3613,ACT IV,"_Yolanda._ Then, mother----"
3614,ACT IV,
3615,ACT IV,(_Goes to bier._)
3616,ACT IV,
3617,ACT IV,_Amaury._                    That name again?
3618,ACT IV,
3619,ACT IV,_Yolanda._                                    While I have breath.
3620,ACT IV,"(_Nobly._) Yes, though you hold me purgeless of that sin"
3621,ACT IV,Only the pale arch-angels may endure
3622,ACT IV,Trembling to muse on!
3623,ACT IV,"Or though yon image of the Magdalen,"
3624,ACT IV,Whose alabaster broke amid her tears
3625,ACT IV,"And her torn hair, forbade me with a voice."
3626,ACT IV,"And you, whose heart is shaken"
3627,ACT IV,"As in a tomb a taper's flame, would know"
3628,ACT IV,I speak with love.
3629,ACT IV,
3630,ACT IV,_Camarin._         Unswerving love.
3631,ACT IV,
3632,ACT IV,"_Amaury._                           Then, by"
3633,ACT IV,"Christ, and the world that craves His blood, I think"
3634,ACT IV,"She, if she would, or you, could point to me,"
3635,ACT IV,"Or you, Vittia Pisani,"
3636,ACT IV,The reason of this sudden piteous death
3637,ACT IV,"Hard on the haunted flight before my father,"
3638,ACT IV,Whose lips refuse.
3639,ACT IV,
3640,ACT IV,_Camarin._         She knows no shred of it.
3641,ACT IV,
3642,ACT IV,_Amaury._ You lie to say it.
3643,ACT IV,
3644,ACT IV,"_Camarin._                   Then will, still--if there"
3645,ACT IV,Is need.
3646,ACT IV,
3647,ACT IV,_Amaury._ Because you love her?
3648,ACT IV,
3649,ACT IV,"_Yolanda._                      Peace, peace, peace."
3650,ACT IV,
3651,ACT IV,_Amaury._ A hollow word for what had never being.
3652,ACT IV,
3653,ACT IV,_Yolanda._ Look on her face and see.
3654,ACT IV,
3655,ACT IV,_Amaury_ (_at bier_).                Upon her face!
3656,ACT IV,Where not oblivion the void of death
3657,ACT IV,"Has hid away, or can, the agony"
3658,ACT IV,Of her last terror--but it trembles still.
3659,ACT IV,"I tell you, no. Grief was enough, but now"
3660,ACT IV,Through it has risen mystery that chokes
3661,ACT IV,As a miasma from Iscariot's tomb.
3662,ACT IV,And till this pall of doubt be rent away
3663,ACT IV,No earth shall fall and quicken with her dust!
3664,ACT IV,But I will search her face ... till it reveals.
3665,ACT IV,
3666,ACT IV,_Camarin._ He raves.
3667,ACT IV,
3668,ACT IV,_Amaury._            Iscariot! yes!
3669,ACT IV,
3670,ACT IV,"_Yolanda._                          Again, peace, peace!"
3671,ACT IV,
3672,ACT IV,_Amaury._ That you may palter!
3673,ACT IV,
3674,ACT IV,_Yolanda_ (_gently_).          That she may not grieve.
3675,ACT IV,
3676,ACT IV,(_Goes again to bier._)
3677,ACT IV,
3678,ACT IV,For--if 'tis near--her soul with this is wrung.
3679,ACT IV,Near! would it were to hear me and impart
3680,ACT IV,"Its yearning and regret to us who live,"
3681,ACT IV,Its dim unhappiness and hollow want.
3682,ACT IV,"Yes, mother, were you now about us, vain,"
3683,ACT IV,Invisible and without any voice
3684,ACT IV,To tell us of you!
3685,ACT IV,Were you and now could hear through what of cold
3686,ACT IV,"Or silence wrap you, oh, so humanly"
3687,ACT IV,And seeming but a veil--
3688,ACT IV,Then would you hear me say--(_suddenly aghast_)
3689,ACT IV,"Ah, God!"
3690,ACT IV,
3691,ACT IV,_Amaury._                             Yolanda!
3692,ACT IV,
3693,ACT IV,(_She starts back from the bier._)
3694,ACT IV,
3695,ACT IV,Yolanda!
3696,ACT IV,
3697,ACT IV,"_Renier._   Girl, what rends you?"
3698,ACT IV,
3699,ACT IV,_Yolanda._                        Saw you not?
3700,ACT IV,
3701,ACT IV,(_Rushes to bier and shakes it._)
3702,ACT IV,
3703,ACT IV,Mother! you hear me? mother!
3704,ACT IV,
3705,ACT IV,_Renier._                    Girl!
3706,ACT IV,
3707,ACT IV,_Yolanda._                         She breathes!
3708,ACT IV,
3709,ACT IV,(_Consternation. Some fall to their
3710,ACT IV,knees._)
3711,ACT IV,
3712,ACT IV,_Vittia._ What? What?
3713,ACT IV,
3714,ACT IV,_Yolanda._            Mother! Her breast! Mother! She moves!
3715,ACT IV,
3716,ACT IV,_Amaury._ God! God!
3717,ACT IV,
3718,ACT IV,_Yolanda._          Stand off from her ... Mother!
3719,ACT IV,
3720,ACT IV,_Camarin._                                         Her eyes!...
3721,ACT IV,They open! open!
3722,ACT IV,
3723,ACT IV,_Yolanda._       Mother!...
3724,ACT IV,
3725,ACT IV,_Amaury._                   See; her lips!
3726,ACT IV,"They strive to speak! O faintly, O so faint!"
3727,ACT IV,Can you not hear?
3728,ACT IV,
3729,ACT IV,_Berengere._      Yolanda!
3730,ACT IV,
3731,ACT IV,_Yolanda._                 Mother!
3732,ACT IV,
3733,ACT IV,_Berengere._                       Renier!
3734,ACT IV,
3735,ACT IV,"_Renier._ Yes, yes?"
3736,ACT IV,
3737,ACT IV,_Berengere._          Yolanda--
3738,ACT IV,
3739,ACT IV,_Renier._                       Speak!
3740,ACT IV,
3741,ACT IV,"_Berengere._                           Christ, save me ... Christ!"
3742,ACT IV,"Yolanda's innocent, and I ... 'twas I."
3743,ACT IV,
3744,ACT IV,_Amaury._ What? what is it she says?
3745,ACT IV,
3746,ACT IV,_Berengere._                          Camarin! Ah!
3747,ACT IV,
3748,ACT IV,"(_She shudders and dies, amid"

3760,ACT IV,"Compel Lord Renier back! he cannot live,"
3761,ACT IV,You only could against Camarin now!
3762,ACT IV,"Wait not to question, but obey me! if"
3763,ACT IV,"You ever--! (_As he rushes in_) Holy Magdalen, defend him!"
3764,ACT IV,
3765,ACT IV,(RENIER _falls back._)

3770,ACT IV,"_Vittia._                   Fool!--Camarin, strike!"
3771,ACT IV,
3772,ACT IV,_Yolanda._ He's wounded!
3773,ACT IV,

3871,JAEL,"I slew him, that Sisera, prince of the host Thou dost hate."
3872,JAEL,"But fear of his blood is upon me, about me is breathen"
3873,JAEL,His spirit--by night and by day come voices that wait.
3874,JAEL,
3875,JAEL,Athirst and affrightened he fled from the star-wrought waters of
3876,JAEL,Kishon.
3877,JAEL,His face was as wool when he swooned at the door of my tent.
3878,JAEL,"The Lord hath given him into the hand of perdition,"
3879,JAEL,I smiled--but he saw not the face of my cunning intent.
3880,JAEL,
3881,JAEL,He thirsted for water: I fed him the curdless milk of the cattle.
3882,JAEL,He lay in the tent under purple and crimson of Tyre.
3883,JAEL,He slept and he dreamt of the surge and storming of battle.
3884,JAEL,Ah ha! but he woke not to waken Jehovah's ire.
3885,JAEL,
3886,JAEL,He slept as he were a chosen of Israel's God Almighty.
3887,JAEL,A dog out of Canaan!--thought he I was woman alone?
3888,JAEL,I slipt like an asp to his ear and laughed for the sight he
3889,JAEL,Would give when the carrion kites should tear to his bone.
3890,JAEL,
3891,JAEL,"I smote thro' his temple the nail, to the dust a worm did I bind him."
3892,JAEL,My heart was a-leap with rage and a-quiver with scorn.
3893,JAEL,And I danced with a holy delight before and behind him--
3894,JAEL,I that am called blessed o'er all who're of Judah born.
3895,JAEL,
3896,JAEL,"""Aye, come, I will show thee, O Barak, a woman is more than a warrior,"""
3897,JAEL,I cried as I lifted the door wherein Sisera lay.

3899,JAEL,"I, Jael, who am subtle to find for the Lord a way!"""
3900,JAEL,
3901,JAEL,"""Above all the daughters of men be blest--of Gilead or Asshur,"""
3902,JAEL,"Sang Deborah, prophetess, under her waving palm."
3903,JAEL,"""Behold her, ye people, behold her the heathen's abasher;"

3910,JAEL,"In songs of his triumph--ye women, why do ye not say?"""
3911,JAEL,

3913,JAEL,"And stood, until Egypt pressed in to be drowned unto death."
3914,JAEL,"My breasts were as fire with the glory, the rocks that were under"
3915,JAEL,My feet grew quick with the gloating that beat in my breath.
3916,JAEL,
3917,JAEL,"At night I stole out where they cast him, a sop to the jackal and"
3918,JAEL,raven.
3919,JAEL,But his bones stood up in the moon and I shook with affright.
3920,JAEL,The strength shrank out of my limbs and I fell a craven
3921,JAEL,Before him--the nail in his temple gleamed bloodily bright.
3922,JAEL,
3923,JAEL,Jehovah! Jehovah! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen?
3924,JAEL,"I slew him, that Sisera, prince of the host Thou dost hate."

3927,JAEL,
3928,JAEL,"I fly to the desert, I fly to the mountain--but they will not hide me."
3929,JAEL,His gods haunt the winds and the caves with vengeance that cries
3930,JAEL,For judgment upon me; the stars in their courses deride me--
3931,JAEL,The stars Thou hast hung with a breath in the wandering skies.
3932,JAEL,
3933,JAEL,Jehovah! Jehovah! I slew him the scourge and sting of Thy Nation.
3934,JAEL,"Take from me his spirit, take from me the voice of his blood."
3935,JAEL,"With madness I rave--by day and by night, defamation!"
3936,JAEL,"Jehovah, release me! Jehovah! if still Thou art God!"

6125,RETURN,It was here I came--the thistle

6150,RETURN,They stood in the same shy poses
6151,RETURN,"Last year, as if to entrance"
6152,RETURN,The stately mulleins to waken

6159,RETURN,"Again I've come to remember,"
6160,RETURN,Again for musing returned
6161,RETURN,"To the searing fields assuaging,"

8918,ACT III,_Third Fol._                             He utters right.
8919,ACT III,Why should we but to follow a mere shepherd
8920,ACT III,Famish--over a hundred desert hills?
8921,ACT III,The prophecy portending him the throne--
8922,ACT III,"Folly, not fate! though it is Samuel's."
8923,ACT III,I'll trust in it no more.
8924,ACT III,
8925,ACT III,_First Fol._                Nor I.
8926,ACT III,
8927,ACT III,_Third Fol._                       And Saul
8928,ACT III,Has driven us from waste to waste--pressed us
8929,ACT III,"Even unto the Philistines for shelter,"
8930,ACT III,And now unto this crag. And is not David's
8931,ACT III,"Thought but of Michal, not of smiting him"
8932,ACT III,"And, with a host, of leaping to the kingdom?"
8933,ACT III,
8934,ACT III,(DAVID _stirs to rise._)
8935,ACT III,
8936,ACT III,_First Fol._ He moves; peace!
8937,ACT III,
8938,ACT III,_Third Fol._                  Let him.
8939,ACT III,
8940,ACT III,_Second Fol._                          Peace.
8941,ACT III,
8942,ACT III,_Third Fol._                                  And fawning too?
8943,ACT III,
8944,ACT III,"_David_ (_sufferingly_). Men--men, we must have news. Perpetual,"
8945,ACT III,"Implacable they stare unto each other,"
8946,ACT III,This rock and stony sky.... We must have news.
8947,ACT III,
8948,ACT III,(_Rises and comes down to them.
8949,ACT III,They are silent._)
8950,ACT III,
8951,ACT III,Longer is death. 'Tis over many days
8952,ACT III,Of sighing--and remembered verdancy;
8953,ACT III,Nor any dew comes here or odour up.
8954,ACT III,Who will go now and bring us word of Saul?
8955,ACT III,
8956,ACT III,"_Third Fol._ Have not Abishai, Abiathar,"
8957,ACT III,And others gone?
8958,ACT III,
8959,ACT III,_David._           Bravely.
8960,ACT III,
8961,ACT III,_Third Fol._                And none returned!
8962,ACT III,
8963,ACT III,_David._ Not one of all.
8964,ACT III,
8965,ACT III,"_Third Fol._ Well, then, we are not swine;"
8966,ACT III,And life's but once.... So we will follow you
8967,ACT III,"No longer hungered and rewarded never,"
8968,ACT III,But perilously ever.
8969,ACT III,
8970,ACT III,_David._               It is well.
8971,ACT III,
8972,ACT III,(_He looses a bracelet from his
8973,ACT III,arm._)
8974,ACT III,
8975,ACT III,This was a gift from Saul. In it is ease.
8976,ACT III,
8977,ACT III,"(_Gives it to_ THIRD FOLLOWER, _who"
8978,ACT III,goes._)
8979,ACT III,
8980,ACT III,This ring was Jonathan's. The jewel tells
8981,ACT III,Still of the sunny haven of his heart.
8982,ACT III,Upon my hand he pressed it--the day we leapt
8983,ACT III,Deeper than friends into each other's love.
8984,ACT III,
8985,ACT III,"(_Gives it to_ FIRST, _who goes._)"
8986,ACT III,
8987,ACT III,This chain----
8988,ACT III,
8989,ACT III,_Second Fol._   I want it not.
8990,ACT III,
8991,ACT III,_David._                       You have not thought;
8992,ACT III,'Tis riches--such as Sidon marts and Tyre
8993,ACT III,Would covet.
8994,ACT III,
8995,ACT III,_Second Fol._ I care not.
8996,ACT III,
8997,ACT III,_David._                   None else is left.
8998,ACT III,
8999,ACT III,_Second Fol._ No matter.
9000,ACT III,
9001,ACT III,_David._                 Then----?
9002,ACT III,
9003,ACT III,_Second Fol._                      There was of Gibeah
9004,ACT III,A woman--dear to me. Her face at night ...
9005,ACT III,Weeping among my dreams....
9006,ACT III,The prophesy
9007,ACT III,Is unfulfilled and vain!
9008,ACT III,
9009,ACT III,_David._                   And you would go?
9010,ACT III,
9011,ACT III,_Second Fol._ The suffering--this cliff.
9012,ACT III,
9013,ACT III,_David._                                 I understand.
9014,ACT III,"(_Motions._) So, without any blame, go--to content."
9015,ACT III,
9016,ACT III,"(_The_ SECOND, _faltering, goes._)"
9017,ACT III,
9018,ACT III,"(_Quietly._) A desolation left, of rock and air,"
9019,ACT III,Of barren sea and bitterness as vast.
9020,ACT III,"Thou hast bereft me, Saul!... and Michal, thou!"
9021,ACT III,
9022,ACT III,"(_He moves up cliff, gazes off,"
9023,ACT III,then kneels as to pray._)
9024,ACT III,
9025,ACT III,My flesh cries for oblivion--to sink
9026,ACT III,Unwaking away into the night ... where is
9027,ACT III,"No tears, but only tides of sleep...."
9028,ACT III,"No, crieth"
9029,ACT III,"Not for oblivion and night, but for"
9030,ACT III,"Rage and revenge! Saul! Saul!... My spirit, peace."
9031,ACT III,I must revenge's call within me quell
9032,ACT III,Though righteously it quivers and aflame.
9033,ACT III,"As pants the hart for the water-brook, so I!"
9034,ACT III,
9035,ACT III,(_He bows his head_.... MICHAL
9036,ACT III,_enters in rags with the lad. She
9037,ACT III,sees_ DAVID _rise and wander into
9038,ACT III,"cave, right._)"
9039,ACT III,
9040,ACT III,"_Michal._ This is the place, then, this?"
9041,ACT III,
9042,ACT III,"_Lad._                                   Yes, princess."
9043,ACT III,
9044,ACT III,_Michal._                                               Here
9045,ACT III,So long in want and sickness he hath hid?
9046,ACT III,Under the livid day and lonelier night?
9047,ACT III,
9048,ACT III,"_Lad._ I brought him water, often."
9049,ACT III,
9050,ACT III,_Michal._                          Little lad!
9051,ACT III,But he has heard no word from me?--not how
9052,ACT III,"My father, Saul, frantic of my repentance,"
9053,ACT III,"Had unto Phalti, a new lord, betrothed me?"
9054,ACT III,How then I fled to win unto these wilds?
9055,ACT III,
9056,ACT III,_Lad._ He heard not anything--only the tales
9057,ACT III,"I told of Moab, my own land.... But, oh!"
9058,ACT III,
9059,ACT III,(DAVID _plays within._)
9060,ACT III,
9061,ACT III,It is his harp.
9062,ACT III,
9063,ACT III,_Michal._         And strains that weep o'er me!...
9064,ACT III,I'll speak to him ... and yet must be unknown!
9065,ACT III,A leper? as a leper could I...?
9066,ACT III,
9067,ACT III,_Lad._                            Why
9068,ACT III,Must he not know you?
9069,ACT III,
9070,ACT III,"_Michal._               Ask me not, lad, now;"
9071,ACT III,But go a little.
9072,ACT III,
9073,ACT III,_Lad._             Yes.
9074,ACT III,
9075,ACT III,(_He sets down the water-skin and goes._)
9076,ACT III,
9077,ACT III,"_Michal_ (_delaying, then in a loud voice_). Unclean! Unclean!"
9078,ACT III,
9079,ACT III,(_Conceals her face in her hair._)
9080,ACT III,
9081,ACT III,_David._ Who crieth here?
9082,ACT III,
9083,ACT III,_Michal._                 Unclean!
9084,ACT III,
9085,ACT III,_David_ (_appearing_).               Who cries unclean?
9086,ACT III,"Poor leper in these wilds, who art thou?"
9087,ACT III,
9088,ACT III,_Michal._                                  One
9089,ACT III,"Outcast and faint, forlorn!"
9090,ACT III,
9091,ACT III,_David._                      Then you have come
9092,ACT III,To one more bitter outcast than yourself--
9093,ACT III,"One who has less than this lone void to give,"
9094,ACT III,"This sterile solitude and sun, this scene"
9095,ACT III,Of leaden desolation that makes mad;
9096,ACT III,"Who has no ease but cave or shading rock,"
9097,ACT III,"Or the still moon, or stars that glide the night."
9098,ACT III,One over whom----
9099,ACT III,
9100,ACT III,"_Michal._          Yet, pity!"
9101,ACT III,
9102,ACT III,_David._                      The pale hours
9103,ACT III,Flow dead into eternity.
9104,ACT III,
9105,ACT III,"_Michal._                  Ah, yet...!"
9106,ACT III,
9107,ACT III,"_David._ My cloak, then, for thy tattered limbs. Or, no--"
9108,ACT III,This chain of Ophir for thy every need.
9109,ACT III,"Once it was dear, but should be so no more."
9110,ACT III,"(_Flinging it to her_). Have it, and with it vanish memory"
9111,ACT III,Out of my breast----
9112,ACT III,
9113,ACT III,"_Michal._             No, no."
9114,ACT III,
9115,ACT III,_David._                      And from me fall
9116,ACT III,Link upon link her loveliness that bound.
9117,ACT III,
9118,ACT III,"_Michal._ Oh, do not!"
9119,ACT III,
9120,ACT III,_David._                                Woman...?
9121,ACT III,
9122,ACT III,_Michal._                                 Nothing. A chain like this
9123,ACT III,I once beheld wind undulantly bright
9124,ACT III,O'er Michal the king's daughter.
9125,ACT III,
9126,ACT III,"_David._                           Woman, the king's?"
9127,ACT III,
9128,ACT III,_Michal._ Pity!
9129,ACT III,
9130,ACT III,_David._        Who are you?
9131,ACT III,
9132,ACT III,_Michal._                    Stay! Unclean!
9133,ACT III,
9134,ACT III,_David._                                    A spy?
9135,ACT III,A spy of Saul and hypocrite have crept
9136,ACT III,Hither to learn...?
9137,ACT III,
9138,ACT III,_Michal._             Have heed--unclean!
9139,ACT III,
9140,ACT III,"_David._                                  How, then"
9141,ACT III,Wandering came you here?
9142,ACT III,
9143,ACT III,_Michal._                  Unclean! Unclean!
9144,ACT III,
9145,ACT III,"_David._ My brain is overfull of fever, mad."
9146,ACT III,"Almost and I had touched thy peril, held"
9147,ACT III,Thy hideous contagion.
9148,ACT III,
9149,ACT III,_Michal._                Wrong!
9150,ACT III,
9151,ACT III,_David._                        Then who
9152,ACT III,"Art thou to know and speak of her, of Michal?"
9153,ACT III,
9154,ACT III,_Michal._ One who has served the king.
9155,ACT III,
9156,ACT III,_David._                               And you have seen
9157,ACT III,"Michal, you have beheld her?"
9158,ACT III,
9159,ACT III,"_Michal._                      Once, when she"
9160,ACT III,In face was fairer and in heart than now
9161,ACT III,They say she is.
9162,ACT III,
9163,ACT III,_David._           And heard her speak?
9164,ACT III,
9165,ACT III,_Michal._                               A night
9166,ACT III,Under the leaves of Gibeah--when she
9167,ACT III,Sang with another--David.
9168,ACT III,
9169,ACT III,_David._                    Say no more.
9170,ACT III,
9171,ACT III,"_Michal._ And from afar, under the moon, blew faint"
9172,ACT III,The treading of the wine-presses with song.
9173,ACT III,"David she loved, but anger-torn betrayed,"
9174,ACT III,Unworthy of him.
9175,ACT III,
9176,ACT III,"_David._           Speak of her no more,"
9177,ACT III,"Nor of her cruelty, unless to pray"
9178,ACT III,He she has ruined may forget her.
9179,ACT III,
9180,ACT III,_Michal._                           Yet
9181,ACT III,If deep she should repent?--if deep she should?
9182,ACT III,
9183,ACT III,(_A cry interrupts. They start._)
9184,ACT III,
9185,ACT III,"David. A jackal? (_Listens._) No, the signal! Word at last!"
9186,ACT III,(_To_ MICHAL). He who is near may prove to thee less kind.
9187,ACT III,
9188,ACT III,(_She goes. He leaps up the cliff._)
9189,ACT III,
9190,ACT III,Abishai? Abiathar?... It is!
9191,ACT III,But staggering and wounded? breathless? torn?
9192,ACT III,"The priest with bloody ephod, too, and wild?"
9193,ACT III,
9194,ACT III,"(_Watching, then springing to meet"
9195,ACT III,them as they reel in._)
9196,ACT III,
9197,ACT III,"Abishai, what is it that you bring?"
9198,ACT III,"Abiathar, up! answer!"
9199,ACT III,
9200,ACT III,_Abiathar._             Water!
9201,ACT III,
9202,ACT III,_David._                       Up!
9203,ACT III,
9204,ACT III,(_He brings the water-skin. They
9205,ACT III,drain it fiercely._)
9206,ACT III,
9207,ACT III,"What is it now so fevered from you stares,"
9208,ACT III,"And breathing, too, abhorrence? Gasp it out."
9209,ACT III,
9210,ACT III,_Abiathar._ I stifle--in a universe--he still--
9211,ACT III,Has breath in.
9212,ACT III,
9213,ACT III,_David._         Saul?
9214,ACT III,
9215,ACT III,_Abiathar._            Ill scathe him! Scorpions
9216,ACT III,Of terror and remorse sting in his soul!
9217,ACT III,
9218,ACT III,"_David._ If you have tidings, not in words so wild."
9219,ACT III,
9220,ACT III,"_Abiathar._ Then ask, and hate shall calm me."
9221,ACT III,
9222,ACT III,_David._                                      Ask?
9223,ACT III,
9224,ACT III,"_Abiathar._                                        On, on!"
9225,ACT III,Seek if he lives!
9226,ACT III,
9227,ACT III,_David._            Who?
9228,ACT III,
9229,ACT III,_Abiathar._              Seek if prophecy
9230,ACT III,Founts yet in Judah!
9231,ACT III,
9232,ACT III,_David._               Samuel...?
9233,ACT III,
9234,ACT III,_Abiathar._                       Is dead!
9235,ACT III,Dead--and of tidings more calamitous.
9236,ACT III,
9237,ACT III,(_A pause._)
9238,ACT III,
9239,ACT III,_David_ (_hoarsely_). Tell on. I hear.
9240,ACT III,
9241,ACT III,_Abiathar._                          Saul gloating to believe
9242,ACT III,"The priests who gathered sacredly at Nob,"
9243,ACT III,"Plotted assisting you, hath had them----"
9244,ACT III,
9245,ACT III,_David._                                   No...!
9246,ACT III,
9247,ACT III,"_Abiathar._ Slain at the hands of Doeg--murdered, all!"
9248,ACT III,
9249,ACT III,_David._ But he--your father?
9250,ACT III,
9251,ACT III,_Abiathar._                   Was among them; fell.
9252,ACT III,
9253,ACT III,(_He stands motionless._)
9254,ACT III,
9255,ACT III,"_David_ (_gently_). Abiathar, my friend!... Appeaseless Saul!"
9256,ACT III,
9257,ACT III,"_Abiathar._ Hear all, hear all! Thy father, too, and mother,"
9258,ACT III,"Even thy kindred, out of Israel"
9259,ACT III,"Are driven into Moab; and this king,"
9260,ACT III,"Delirious still for blood as a desert pard,"
9261,ACT III,"With Merab, whelp of him, and many armed,"
9262,ACT III,Is near us now--a-quiver at Engeddi
9263,ACT III,For your destruction:
9264,ACT III,
9265,ACT III,(DAVID _struggles for control._)
9266,ACT III,
9267,ACT III,And yet you will not strike.
9268,ACT III,
9269,ACT III,"_David_ (_low_). No, but of Michal, tell me good at once,"
9270,ACT III,"Lest unendurable this lot, I may----"
9271,ACT III,Mounting o'er every oath into revenge.
9272,ACT III,
9273,ACT III,_Abiathar._ Ha--Michal!
9274,ACT III,
9275,ACT III,_David._                She withholds her father's wrath?
9276,ACT III,
9277,ACT III,_Abiathar._ She's well.
9278,ACT III,
9279,ACT III,_David._                Not if you say no more.
9280,ACT III,
9281,ACT III,_Abiathar._                                     I know
9282,ACT III,Nothing of her.
9283,ACT III,
9284,ACT III,_David._          Your look belies.
9285,ACT III,
9286,ACT III,_Abiathar._                         Perhaps:
9287,ACT III,As did her love.
9288,ACT III,
9289,ACT III,_David._           That is for me.
9290,ACT III,
9291,ACT III,"_Abiathar._                        Well, what?"
9292,ACT III,A woman who betrays?
9293,ACT III,
9294,ACT III,"_David._               Speak, not evade;"
9295,ACT III,And judge her when earth has no mystery.
9296,ACT III,
9297,ACT III,_Abiathar._ Then from your craving put her--wide; she is
9298,ACT III,Unworthy any tremor of your veins.
9299,ACT III,
9300,ACT III,"_David._ Dawn-lilies under dew are then unworthy,"
9301,ACT III,And nesting doves are horrible to heaven.
9302,ACT III,I will not so believe. Your reason?
9303,ACT III,
9304,ACT III,_Abiathar._                                              Saul
9305,ACT III,"Has given her--and she will wed him, aye--"
9306,ACT III,"To Phalti, a new lord."
9307,ACT III,
9308,ACT III,_David._                 Untrue of her!
9309,ACT III,
9310,ACT III,_Abiathar._ Cry. Yet you will believe it.

9312,ACT III,_David._                                  Not until
9313,ACT III,The parable of verdant spring is hushed
9314,ACT III,"Ever of bloom, to prove it. Never till"

9352,ACT III,
9353,ACT III,_David._                 We are discovered--near

9378,ACT III,
9379,ACT III,_David._ Almost I am beyond this tolerance.
9380,ACT III,
9381,ACT III,_Abiathar._ In truth. Therefore it is you rise and shake
9382,ACT III,Out of his power the sceptre!

9453,ACT III,It came as never before--as drunkenness.
9454,ACT III,
9455,ACT III,_Abner._ Then--safe to leave him?
9456,ACT III,
9457,ACT III,_Doeg._                           Will he brook denial?

9586,ACT III,
9587,ACT III,_Merab._ What is your mien? you will not?
9588,ACT III,
9589,ACT III,_David._                                  Twice the words--
9590,ACT III,Full from her lips--and to betray her father.
9591,ACT III,
9592,ACT III,(ABIATHAR _discovers_ SAUL.)
9593,ACT III,

9595,ACT III,
9596,ACT III,_David._                       Odious utterly!
9597,ACT III,As yonder sea of death and bitter salt!
9598,ACT III,"As foam-girt Joppa of idolatry,"

9603,ACT III,"Morning would move with horror of it, noon"
9604,ACT III,"A livid sepulchre of shame span o'er,"
9605,ACT III,And night shrink to remember day had been!
9606,ACT III,
9607,ACT III,_Merab._ You scorn--you scorn me?
9608,ACT III,

9610,ACT III,

9612,ACT III,
9613,ACT III,(_She laughs shrilly._)
9614,ACT III,
9615,ACT III,Perchance you had not heard that Jonathan
9616,ACT III,Knows to the Philistines you fled--and loathes you!
9617,ACT III,
9618,ACT III,_David._ I have not heard.
9619,ACT III,
9620,ACT III,"_Merab._                   Nor have not, ah? how Michal"

9777,ACT IV,"side, the teraphim, or image of divination; on the other"
9778,ACT IV,side a stairway mounts to the roof. Above is the night and
9779,ACT IV,vague lightning amid a moan of wind. During the act comes

9949,ACT IV,Him I would question.

10138,ACT IV,_David._            Hither coming?
10139,ACT IV,
10140,ACT IV,_Adah._                            She!
10141,ACT IV,
10142,ACT IV,(_The gate is thrown open
10143,ACT IV,fiercely._)
10144,ACT IV,
10145,ACT IV,"_Merab_ (_entering_). Woman and witch, did Adriel, my husband,"
10146,ACT IV,
10147,ACT IV,(_Sees_ DAVID.)
10148,ACT IV,
10149,ACT IV,Come to you with the king?
10150,ACT IV,
10151,ACT IV,"_David._                   Unnatural,"
10152,ACT IV,"Unkind, most cruel sister!"
10153,ACT IV,
10154,ACT IV,_Merab_ (_shrinks_).       You are here?
10155,ACT IV,
10156,ACT IV,"_David._ Once me you would have poisoned, but the coil"
10157,ACT IV,Within your bosom I beheld. And now
10158,ACT IV,Michal your sister is the victim.
10159,ACT IV,
10160,ACT IV,_Merab._                          I--
10161,ACT IV,Know not your meaning.
10162,ACT IV,
10163,ACT IV,"_David._               The battle burning yonder,"
10164,ACT IV,"If it adversely veers, the king has planned"
10165,ACT IV,Michal is not to live lest she may hap
10166,ACT IV,Unto my arms.
10167,ACT IV,
10168,ACT IV,_Merab._      That Michal shall be slain?
10169,ACT IV,
10170,ACT IV,(_The tumult again._)
10171,ACT IV,
10172,ACT IV,"_David._ Almighty, smite, and save to Thee thy people!"
10173,ACT IV,And save Thy altars unto Israel!

10183,ACT IV,
10184,ACT IV,"_Merab._                   Girl, Adah, draw the bar."

10190,ACT IV,and the gate._)
10191,ACT IV,
10192,ACT IV,_Doeg._ What place is this? Why do you bar that gate?
10193,ACT IV,"Merab, 'tis you? Why do you gaze, rigid?"
10194,ACT IV,"And this is the blind witch, Miriam?"
10195,ACT IV,
10196,ACT IV,_David._                             It is.
10197,ACT IV,
10198,ACT IV,(_He throws off the cloak._)
10199,ACT IV,
10200,ACT IV,_Doeg._ Lured? I am snared? a trap?
10201,ACT IV,
10202,ACT IV,_David._                            Where have you Michal?
10203,ACT IV,
10204,ACT IV,_Doeg_ (_drawing_). No closer!
10205,ACT IV,
10206,ACT IV,_David._                       If she is an atom harmed----!
10207,ACT IV,Where is she?
10208,ACT IV,
10209,ACT IV,"_Doeg._      I was the servant of the king,"
10210,ACT IV,I but obey him.
10211,ACT IV,
10212,ACT IV,_David._        And thy horrible heart.
10213,ACT IV,"Then speak, or unto frenzy I am driven."
10214,ACT IV,
10215,ACT IV,_Doeg._ I'll drive you there with----
10216,ACT IV,
10217,ACT IV,(_Breaks off with low laugh._)
10218,ACT IV,
10219,ACT IV,_David._                              Tell it!
10220,ACT IV,
10221,ACT IV,_Doeg._                                        Unto your
10222,ACT IV,Soft sympathy--and passion? (_Laughs._) She is dead.
10223,ACT IV,
10224,ACT IV,"_David_ (_immovable, then repressed_)."
10225,ACT IV,"If it is so, the lightning, that is wrath"
10226,ACT IV,"Within the veins of God, should sink its fang"
10227,ACT IV,Into thy bosom and sear out thy heart.
10228,ACT IV,"If it is so, this momentary calm,"
10229,ACT IV,"This silence pouring overfull the world,"
10230,ACT IV,Would rush and in thee cry until thy bones
10231,ACT IV,Broken of guilt are crumbled in thy groans.
10232,ACT IV,"Dead, she is dead?"
10233,ACT IV,
10234,ACT IV,"_Miriam._          No, David, my lord, he lies!"
10235,ACT IV,
10236,ACT IV,"(_Strangely, as in a trance._)"
10237,ACT IV,
10238,ACT IV,"To wound you, lies!"

10241,ACT IV,
10242,ACT IV,_Miriam._                     I see her eyes!
10243,ACT IV,
10244,ACT IV,(_All listen amazed._)
10245,ACT IV,
10246,ACT IV,I see her in a vision. She is near----
10247,ACT IV,Is in a cave--is bound--and is alone.
10248,ACT IV,I will go to her--quickly bring her.
10249,ACT IV,
10250,ACT IV,_Doeg._                              Not
10251,ACT IV,
10252,ACT IV,(_Lunges at her._)
10253,ACT IV,
10254,ACT IV,If this shall reach you.
10255,ACT IV,
10256,ACT IV,"_David._                 Ah, to pierce a woman!"
10257,ACT IV,
10258,ACT IV,(MIRIAM _finds her way out._)
10259,ACT IV,
10260,ACT IV,"You've plotted, have been false and bloody, foul,"
10261,ACT IV,And as a pestilence of midnight marsh
10262,ACT IV,Have oozed corruption into all around you.
10263,ACT IV,"The kingdom thro' you is in brokenness,"
10264,ACT IV,"Within its arteries you flow, poison,"
10265,ACT IV,"Incentive of irruption and unrest,"
10266,ACT IV,"Of treachery and disaffection's sore,"
10267,ACT IV,Till even the stars that light it seem as tares
10268,ACT IV,Sown hostile o'er the nightly vale of heaven.

10277,ACT IV,(_He rushes in; they engage_; DOEG

10287,ACT IV,
10288,ACT IV,"(_Sees_ DOEG _and stops, pale._)"
10289,ACT IV,
10290,ACT IV,_David._ Fetter him.
10291,ACT IV,
10292,ACT IV,_Abiathar._           Only fetter? (_His dagger out_) the murderer
10293,ACT IV,Of priestly sanctity and of my father?
10294,ACT IV,
10295,ACT IV,_David._ Abiathar! You know obedience?
10296,ACT IV,
10297,ACT IV,(DOEG _is sullenly bound and led
10298,ACT IV,"aside. Then a panic is heard afar,"
10299,ACT IV,"and dim laments._ DAVID, _who has"

10301,ACT IV,up._)
10302,ACT IV,
10303,ACT IV,Listen! that cry!
10304,ACT IV,
10305,ACT IV,_A voice._        Woe! woe!
10306,ACT IV,
10307,ACT IV,_David._                    What is its wail?
10308,ACT IV,
10309,ACT IV,_The Voice._ The battle's lost!
10310,ACT IV,
10311,ACT IV,_David._                        Abiathar--?
10312,ACT IV,
10313,ACT IV,_The Voice._                                Saul flees!
10314,ACT IV,
10315,ACT IV,"_David._ Abiathar, is lost?"
10316,ACT IV,
10317,ACT IV,_Abiathar._                 I fear it.
10318,ACT IV,
10319,ACT IV,_David._                               Then (_pointing to_ DOEG)
10320,ACT IV,"Off with his armour for me, I will go"
10321,ACT IV,"Forth and may backward, backward bend defeat."
10322,ACT IV,Duty to Saul is over.
10323,ACT IV,
10324,ACT IV,_Adriel._             You must not.
10325,ACT IV,A fruitless intrepidity it were.
10326,ACT IV,
10327,ACT IV,_Abiathar._ Remember your anointing!

10332,ACT IV,
10333,ACT IV,(DAVID _has turned and sees her
10334,ACT IV,enter with_ MIRIAM.)
10335,ACT IV,

10346,ACT IV,
10347,ACT IV,_Michal._              David! look on me.
10348,ACT IV,
10349,ACT IV,_David._ My words must be alone with her--alone.

10356,ACT IV,
10357,ACT IV,(_He is silent._)
10358,ACT IV,
10359,ACT IV,I ask not anything but to be heard--
10360,ACT IV,Though once I would not hear. Has all of life
10361,ACT IV,No glow for me?
10362,ACT IV,
10363,ACT IV,_David._        Betrayers should have none.
10364,ACT IV,
10365,ACT IV,_Michal._ I was a woman--the entanglement
10366,ACT IV,Of duty amid love we have no skill
10367,ACT IV,"To loosen, but with passion."
10368,ACT IV,
10369,ACT IV,_David._                     You too late
10370,ACT IV,Remember it is so.
10371,ACT IV,
10372,ACT IV,_Michal._          Nobility
10373,ACT IV,All unbelievable it seemed that you
10374,ACT IV,Could innocently wait on time to tide
10375,ACT IV,"You to the kingdom. Then forgive, I plead."
10376,ACT IV,
10377,ACT IV,"_David._ But in the wilderness, your perfidy!"
10378,ACT IV,
10379,ACT IV,"_Michal._ Doubt of it welleth thro' your voice. No, no,"
10380,ACT IV,To save you strove I----!
10381,ACT IV,
10382,ACT IV,_David._                  Michal?
10383,ACT IV,
10384,ACT IV,_Michal._                         Not to betray!
10385,ACT IV,"From Saul, my father, penitent I fled,"
10386,ACT IV,Seeking you in Engeddi's wild.
10387,ACT IV,
10388,ACT IV,_David._                       And Phalti?
10389,ACT IV,
10390,ACT IV,_Michal._ 'Twas wedding him I loathed.
10391,ACT IV,
10392,ACT IV,_David._                               Say true!
10393,ACT IV,
10394,ACT IV,_Michal._                                        This knife
10395,ACT IV,Unfailingly into my breast had sunk
10396,ACT IV,"And spared me, had not flight."
10397,ACT IV,
10398,ACT IV,_David._                       This--this can be?
10399,ACT IV,
10400,ACT IV,(_A great joy dawning in him._)
10401,ACT IV,
10402,ACT IV,"Beyond all hope it is, even as day's"
10403,ACT IV,Wide empery outspans our littleness.
10404,ACT IV,A tithing of thy loveliness were beauty
10405,ACT IV,"Enough for earth. Yet it is mine, is mine?"
10406,ACT IV,
10407,ACT IV,_Michal._ David--for ever!
10408,ACT IV,
10409,ACT IV,(_She starts toward his arms. But

10417,ACT IV,What have you?
10418,ACT IV,
10419,ACT IV,_Adriel._      Saul--is slain!
10420,ACT IV,
10421,ACT IV,_Michal._                      My father?
10422,ACT IV,
10423,ACT IV,_Adriel._                                 Slain!
10424,ACT IV,And Jonathan----
10425,ACT IV,
10426,ACT IV,_David._          No!
10427,ACT IV,
10428,ACT IV,_Adriel._             Fell beside him down ...
10429,ACT IV,The fray was fast--Israel fled--the foe
10430,ACT IV,"Fierce after Saul, whom Jonathan defended."
10431,ACT IV,
10432,ACT IV,_Michal._ My father!
10433,ACT IV,
10434,ACT IV,_David._             And my brother Jonathan!
10435,ACT IV,If I believe it will not miracle
10436,ACT IV,Alone bring joy again unto my pain?
10437,ACT IV,
10438,ACT IV,"(_The wailing again, and deeper"
10439,ACT IV,groans._)
10440,ACT IV,
10441,ACT IV,"O Israel, the Infinite has touched"
10442,ACT IV,Thy glory and it changes to a shroud!
10443,ACT IV,"Thy splendour is as vintage overspilt,"
10444,ACT IV,"For Saul upon the mountains low is lying,"
10445,ACT IV,"And Jonathan beside him, beautiful"
10446,ACT IV,Beyond the mar of battle and of death.
10447,ACT IV,"Yea, kingly Jonathan! And I would give"
10448,ACT IV,The beating of my life into his veins.
10449,ACT IV,Willing for it would I be drouth and die!...
10450,ACT IV,
10451,ACT IV,(_As the wails re-arise._)
10452,ACT IV,
10453,ACT IV,"Peaks, mountains of Gilboa! let no more"
10454,ACT IV,"Dew be upon you, and as sackcloth let"
10455,ACT IV,"Clouds cover you, and ashes be your soil,"
10456,ACT IV,Until I bring upon Philistia
10457,ACT IV,"And Gath and Askalon extinguishing,"
10458,ACT IV,And sorrow--and immensity of tears!

10460,ACT IV,(MICHAL _goes to him. He folds her
10461,ACT IV,in his arms._)
10462,ACT IV,
10463,ACT IV,But we must calm the flowing of this grief.
10464,ACT IV,"Though yet we cannot mind us to remember,"
10465,ACT IV,Love will as sandal-breath and trickling balm
10466,ACT IV,"O'erheal us in the unbegotten years,"
10467,ACT IV,Too headlong must not be our agony.
10468,ACT IV,"Hush now thy woundedness, my Michal, now."
