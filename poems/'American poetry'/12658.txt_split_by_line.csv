37,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
38,PREFACE.,
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,"Some small part of this book being personally censorious, and in that"
41,PREFACE.,"part the names of real persons being used without their assent, it seems"
42,PREFACE.,fit that a few words be said of the matter in sober prose. What it seems
43,PREFACE.,well to say I have already said with sufficient clarity in the preface
44,PREFACE.,"of another book, somewhat allied to this by that feature of its"
45,PREFACE.,"character. I quote from ""Black Beetles in Amber:"""
46,PREFACE.,
47,PREFACE.,"""Many of the verses in this book are republished, with considerable"
48,PREFACE.,"alterations, from various newspapers. Of my motives in writing and in"
49,PREFACE.,"now republishing I do not care to make either defence or explanation,"
50,PREFACE.,except with reference to those who since my first censure of them have
51,PREFACE.,passed away. To one having only a reader's interest in the matter it may
52,PREFACE.,easily seem that the verses relating to those might properly have been
53,PREFACE.,"omitted from this collection. But if these pieces, or indeed, if any"
54,PREFACE.,"considerable part of my work in literature, have the intrinsic worth"
55,PREFACE.,"which by this attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed, their"
56,PREFACE.,"permanent suppression is impossible, and it is only a question of when"
57,PREFACE.,and by whom they will be republished. Some one will surely search them
58,PREFACE.,out and put them in circulation.
59,PREFACE.,
60,PREFACE.,"""I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work"
61,PREFACE.,collected in his lifetime; and this seems to me especially true of one
62,PREFACE.,"whose work, necessarily engendering animosities, is peculiarly exposed"
63,PREFACE.,to challenge as unjust. That is a charge that can best be examined
64,PREFACE.,before time has effaced the evidence. For the death of a man of whom
65,PREFACE.,I have written what I may venture to think worthy to live I am no way
66,PREFACE.,"responsible; and however sincerely I may regret it, I can hardly consent"
67,PREFACE.,that it shall affect my literary fortunes. If the satirist who does not
68,PREFACE.,"accept the remarkable doctrine that, while condemning the sin he should"
69,PREFACE.,"spare the sinner, were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous"
70,PREFACE.,with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship.
71,PREFACE.,
72,PREFACE.,"""Persuaded of the validity of all this I have not hesitated to reprint"
73,PREFACE.,"even certain 'epitaphs' which, once of the living, are now of the dead,"
74,PREFACE.,as all the others must eventually be. The objection inheres in all forms
75,PREFACE.,of applied satire--my understanding of whose laws and liberties is at
76,PREFACE.,least derived from reverent study of the masters. That in respect of
77,PREFACE.,matters herein mentioned I have but followed their practice can be shown
78,PREFACE.,"by abundant instance and example."""
79,PREFACE.,
80,PREFACE.,In arranging these verses for publication I have thought it needless
81,PREFACE.,"to classify them according to character, as ""Serious,"" ""Comic,"""
82,PREFACE.,"""Sentimental,"" ""Satirical,"" and so forth. I do the reader the honor to"
83,PREFACE.,think that he will readily discern the nature of what he is reading;
84,PREFACE.,and I entertain the hope that his mood will accommodate itself without
85,PREFACE.,disappointment to that of his author.

587,I.,I.
588,I.,
589,I.,
590,I.,I know not if it was a dream. I viewed
591,I.,"A city where the restless multitude,"
592,I.,Between the eastern and the western deep
593,I.,"Had roared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude."
594,I.,
595,I.,Colossal palaces crowned every height;
596,I.,Towers from valleys climbed into the light;
597,I.,"O'er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes"
598,I.,"Hung in the blue, barbarically bright."
599,I.,
600,I.,"But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day"
601,I.,"Touched the black masses with a grace of gray,"
602,I.,Dim spires of temples to the nation's God
603,I.,Studding high spaces of the wide survey.
604,I.,
605,I.,Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep
606,I.,"Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep,"
607,I.,"Yet whispered of an hour-when sleepers wake,"
608,I.,"The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep."
609,I.,
610,I.,The gardens greened upon the builded hills
611,I.,Above the tethered thunders of the mills
612,I.,With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet
613,I.,+  By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills.
614,I.,
615,I.,"A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space,"
616,I.,Looked on the builder's blocks about his base
617,I.,And bared his wounded breast in sign to say:
618,I.,"""Strike! 't is my destiny to lodge your race."
619,I.,
620,I.,"""'T was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed"
621,I.,"Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed"
622,I.,"Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness,"
623,I.,"While on their foeman's offal they caroused."""
624,I.,
625,I.,Ships from afar afforested the bay.
626,I.,Within their huge and chambered bodies lay
627,I.,The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed
628,I.,The hardy argosies to far Cathay.
629,I.,
630,I.,Beside the city of the living spread--
631,I.,Strange fellowship!--the city of the dead;
632,I.,"And much I wondered what its humble folk,"
633,I.,"To see how bravely they were housed, had said."
634,I.,
635,I.,"Noting how firm their habitations stood,"
636,I.,Broad-based and free of perishable wood--
637,I.,How deep in granite and how high in brass
638,I.,"The names were wrought of eminent and good,"
639,I.,
640,I.,"I said: ""When gold or power is their aim,"
641,I.,"The smile of beauty or the wage of shame,"
642,I.,Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare
643,I.,"When they would conquer an abiding fame."""
644,I.,
645,I.,From the red East the sun--a solemn rite--
646,I.,Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height
647,I.,Above the dead; and then with all his strength
648,I.,Struck the great city all aroar with light!
649,I.,
650,I.,
651,II.,II.
652,II.,
653,II.,I know not if it was a dream. I came
654,II.,Unto a land where something seemed the same
655,II.,"That I had known as 't were but yesterday,"
656,II.,But what it was I could not rightly name.
657,II.,
658,II.,It was a strange and melancholy land.
659,II.,Silent and desolate. On either hand
660,II.,"Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead,"
661,II.,"And dead above it seemed the hills to stand,"
662,II.,
663,II.,"Grayed all with age, those lonely hills--ah me,"
664,II.,How worn and weary they appeared to be!
665,II.,Between their feet long dusty fissures clove
666,II.,The plain in aimless windings to the sea.
667,II.,
668,II.,"One hill there was which, parted from the rest,"
669,II.,Stood where the eastern water curved a-west.
670,II.,Silent and passionless it stood. I thought
671,II.,I saw a scar upon its giant breast.
672,II.,
673,II.,The sun with sullen and portentous gleam
674,II.,Hung like a menace on the sea's extreme;
675,II.,"Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars"
676,II.,Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam.
677,II.,
678,II.,"It was a dismal and a dreadful sight,"
679,II.,"That desert in its cold, uncanny light;"
680,II.,No soul but I alone to mark the fear
681,II.,And imminence of everlasting night!
682,II.,
683,II.,All presages and prophecies of doom
684,II.,"Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom,"
685,II.,And in the midst of that accursèd scene
686,II.,A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb.

695,ELIXER VITAE.,(Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!)
696,ELIXER VITAE.,Sealed upon my senses with so deep
697,ELIXER VITAE.,A stupefaction that men thought me dead.
698,ELIXER VITAE.,"The centuries stole by with noiseless tread,"
699,ELIXER VITAE.,Like spectres in the twilight of my dream;
700,ELIXER VITAE.,I saw mankind in dim procession sweep
701,ELIXER VITAE.,"Through life, oblivion at each extreme."
702,ELIXER VITAE.,"Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa's growing,"
703,ELIXER VITAE.,Loaded my lap and o'er my knees was flowing.
704,ELIXER VITAE.,
705,ELIXER VITAE.,"The generations came with dance and song,"
706,ELIXER VITAE.,And each observed me curiously there.
707,ELIXER VITAE.,"Some asked: ""Who was he?"" Others in the throng"
708,ELIXER VITAE.,"Replied: ""A wicked monk who slept at prayer."""
709,ELIXER VITAE.,"Some said I was a saint, and some a bear--"
710,ELIXER VITAE.,"These all were women. So the young and gay,"
711,ELIXER VITAE.,"Visibly wrinkling as they fared along,"
712,ELIXER VITAE.,Doddered at last on failing limbs away;
713,ELIXER VITAE.,"Though some, their footing in my beard entangled,"
714,ELIXER VITAE.,Fell into its abysses and were strangled.
715,ELIXER VITAE.,
716,ELIXER VITAE.,At last a generation came that walked
717,ELIXER VITAE.,"More slowly forward to the common tomb,"
718,ELIXER VITAE.,Then altogether stopped. The women talked
719,ELIXER VITAE.,"Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom"
720,ELIXER VITAE.,Looked darkly on them with a look of doom;
721,ELIXER VITAE.,"And one cried out: ""We are immortal now--"
722,ELIXER VITAE.,"How need we these?"" And a dread figure stalked,"
723,ELIXER VITAE.,"Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow,"
724,ELIXER VITAE.,"And all men cried: ""Decapitate the women,"
725,ELIXER VITAE.,"Or soon there'll be no room to stand or swim in!"""
726,ELIXER VITAE.,
727,ELIXER VITAE.,So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped
728,ELIXER VITAE.,"From its fair shoulders, and but men alone"
729,ELIXER VITAE.,"Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped,"
730,ELIXER VITAE.,"Enough of room remained in every zone,"
731,ELIXER VITAE.,And Peace ascended Woman's vacant throne.
732,ELIXER VITAE.,"Thus, life's elixir being found (the quacks"
733,ELIXER VITAE.,Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped)
734,ELIXER VITAE.,'Twas made worth having by the headsman's axe.
735,ELIXER VITAE.,"Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking,"

1409,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Where the squalid town of Dae
1410,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Irks the comfortable sea,"

1412,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"As for wealth we set a wish,"
1413,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Dwelt a king by right divine,"
1414,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Sprung from Adam's royal line,"
1415,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1416,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Divers kinds of kings there be.
1417,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1418,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Name nor fame had Picklepip:
1419,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Ne'er a soldier nor a ship
1420,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Bore his banners in the sun;
1421,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Naught knew he of kingly sport,"
1422,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And he held his royal court
1423,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Under an inverted tun.
1424,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Love and roses, ages through,"
1425,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Bloom where cot and trellis stand;
1426,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Never yet these blossoms grew--
1427,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Never yet was room for two--
1428,THE TOWN OF DAE.,In a cask upon the strand.
1429,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1430,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"So it happened, as it ought,"
1431,THE TOWN OF DAE.,That his simple schemes he wrought
1432,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Through the lagging summer's day
1433,THE TOWN OF DAE.,In a solitary way.
1434,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"So it happened, as was best,"
1435,THE TOWN OF DAE.,That he took his nightly rest
1436,THE TOWN OF DAE.,With no dreadful incubus
1437,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"This way eyed and that way tressed,"
1438,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Featured thus, and thus, and thus,"
1439,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Lying lead-like on a breast
1440,THE TOWN OF DAE.,By cares of State enough oppressed.
1441,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Yet in dreams his fancies rude
1442,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Claimed a lordly latitude.
1443,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1444,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Dreamers mate above their state
1445,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And waken back to their degree.
1446,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1447,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Once to cask himself away
1448,THE TOWN OF DAE.,He prepared at close of day.
1449,THE TOWN OF DAE.,As he tugged with swelling throat
1450,THE TOWN OF DAE.,At a most unkingly coat--
1451,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Not to get it off, but on,"
1452,THE TOWN OF DAE.,For the serving sun was gone--
1453,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Passed a silk-appareled sprite
1454,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Toward her castle on the height,"
1455,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Seized and set the garment right.
1456,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Turned the startled Picklepip--
1457,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Splendid crimson cheek and lip!
1458,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Turned again to sneak away,"
1459,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1460,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"But she bade the villain stay,"
1461,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Bade him thank her, which he did"
1462,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"With a speech that slipped and slid,"
1463,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Sprawled and stumbled in its gait
1464,THE TOWN OF DAE.,As a dancer tries to skate.
1465,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1466,THE TOWN OF DAE.,In the face of silk and lace
1467,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Rags too bold should never be.
1468,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1469,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Lady Minnow cocked her head:
1470,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"""Mister Picklepip,"" she said,"
1471,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"""Do you ever think to wed?"""
1472,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1473,THE TOWN OF DAE.,No fair lady ever made a

1475,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1476,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Wretched little Picklepip
1477,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Said he hadn't any ship,"
1478,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Any flocks at his command,"
1479,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Nor to feed them any land;
1480,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Said he never in his life
1481,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Owned a mine to keep a wife.
1482,THE TOWN OF DAE.,But the guilty stammer so
1483,THE TOWN OF DAE.,That his meaning wouldn't flow;
1484,THE TOWN OF DAE.,So he thought his aim to reach
1485,THE TOWN OF DAE.,By some figurative speech:
1486,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Said his Fate had been unkind
1487,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Had pursued him from behind
1488,THE TOWN OF DAE.,(How the mischief could it else?)
1489,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1490,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Came upon him unaware,"
1491,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Caught him by the collar--there
1492,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Gushed the little lady's glee
1493,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Like a gush of golden bells:
1494,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"""Picklepip, why, that is _me_!"""
1495,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1496,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Grammar's for great scholars--she
1497,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Loved the summer and the lea.
1498,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1499,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Stupid little Picklepip
1500,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Allowed the subtle hint to slip--
1501,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Maundered on about the ship
1502,THE TOWN OF DAE.,That he did not chance to own;
1503,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Told this grievance o'er and o'er,"
1504,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Knowing that she knew before;
1505,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Told her how he dwelt alone.
1506,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Lady Minnow, for reply,"
1507,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Cut him off with ""So do I!"""
1508,THE TOWN OF DAE.,But she reddened at the fib;
1509,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Servitors had she, _ad lib._"
1510,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1511,THE TOWN OF DAE.,In her youth who speaks no truth
1512,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Ne'er shall young and honest be.
1513,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1514,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Witless little Picklepip
1515,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Manned again his mental ship
1516,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And veered her with a sudden shift.
1517,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Painted to the lady's thought
1518,THE TOWN OF DAE.,How he wrestled and he wrought
1519,THE TOWN OF DAE.,
1520,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Stoutly with the swimming drift
1521,THE TOWN OF DAE.,By the kindly river brought
1522,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"From the mountain to the sea,"
1523,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Fuel for the town of Dae.
1524,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Tedious tale for lady's ear:
1525,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"From her castle on the height,"
1526,THE TOWN OF DAE.,She had watched her water-knight
1527,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Through the seasons of a year,"
1528,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Challenge more than met his view
1529,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And conquer better than he knew.
1530,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Now she shook her pretty pate
1531,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And stamped her foot--'t was growing late:
1532,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"""Mister Picklepip, when I"
1533,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Drifting seaward pass you by;
1534,THE TOWN OF DAE.,When the waves my forehead kiss
1535,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And my tresses float above--
1536,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Dead and drowned for lack of love--
1537,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"You'll be sorry, sir, for this!"""
1538,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And the silly creature cried--
1539,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Feared, perchance, the rising tide."
1540,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Town of Dae by the sea,"
1541,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Madam Adam, when she had 'em,"

1544,THE TOWN OF DAE.,_Fiat lux!_ Love's lumination

1550,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Of a voice somewhere repeating

1552,THE TOWN OF DAE.,And the soul of Picklepip
1553,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Sprang upon his trembling lip,"
1554,THE TOWN OF DAE.,But he spake no further word
1555,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Of the wealth he did not own;
1556,THE TOWN OF DAE.,In that moment had outgrown
1557,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Ship and mine and flock and land--
1558,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Even his cask upon the strand.
1559,THE TOWN OF DAE.,"Dropped a stricken star to earth,"
1560,THE TOWN OF DAE.,Type of wealth and worldly worth.

2652,AN ALIBI.,
2653,AN ALIBI.,
2654,AN ALIBI.,"A famous journalist, who long"
2655,AN ALIBI.,Had told the great unheaded throng
2656,AN ALIBI.,"Whate'er they thought, by day or night."
2657,AN ALIBI.,"Was true as Holy Writ, and right,"
2658,AN ALIBI.,"Was caught in--well, on second thought,"
2659,AN ALIBI.,"It is enough that he was caught,"
2660,AN ALIBI.,And being thrown in jail became
2661,AN ALIBI.,The fuel of a public flame.
2662,AN ALIBI.,
2663,AN ALIBI.,"""_Vox populi vox Dei_,"" said"
2664,AN ALIBI.,The jailer. Inxling bent his head
2665,AN ALIBI.,Without remark: that motto good
2666,AN ALIBI.,In bold-faced type had always stood
2667,AN ALIBI.,Above the columns where his pen
2668,AN ALIBI.,Had rioted in praise of men
2669,AN ALIBI.,And all they said--provided he
2670,AN ALIBI.,Was sure they mostly did agree.
2671,AN ALIBI.,Meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife
2672,AN ALIBI.,"To take, or save, the culprit's life"
2673,AN ALIBI.,"Or liberty (which, I suppose,"
2674,AN ALIBI.,Was much the same to him) arose
2675,AN ALIBI.,Outside. The journal that his pen
2676,AN ALIBI.,Adorned denounced his crime--but then
2677,AN ALIBI.,Its editor in secret tried
2678,AN ALIBI.,To have the indictment set aside.
2679,AN ALIBI.,The opposition papers swore
2680,AN ALIBI.,"His father was a rogue before,"
2681,AN ALIBI.,And all his wife's relations were
2682,AN ALIBI.,Like him and similar to her.
2683,AN ALIBI.,They begged their readers to subscribe
2684,AN ALIBI.,A dollar each to make a bribe
2685,AN ALIBI.,That any Judge would feel was large
2686,AN ALIBI.,Enough to prove the gravest charge--
2687,AN ALIBI.,"Unless, it might be, the defense"
2688,AN ALIBI.,Put up superior evidence.
2689,AN ALIBI.,The law's traditional delay
2690,AN ALIBI.,Was all too short: the trial day
2691,AN ALIBI.,Dawned red and menacing. The Judge
2692,AN ALIBI.,"Sat on the Bench and wouldn't budge,"
2693,AN ALIBI.,And all the motions counsel made
2694,AN ALIBI.,Could not move _him_--and there he stayed.
2695,AN ALIBI.,"""The case must now proceed,"" he said,"
2696,AN ALIBI.,"""While I am just in heart and head,"
2697,AN ALIBI.,"It happens--as, indeed, it ought--"
2698,AN ALIBI.,Both sides with equal sums have bought
2699,AN ALIBI.,My favor: I can try the cause
2700,AN ALIBI.,"Impartially."" (Prolonged applause.)"
2701,AN ALIBI.,
2702,AN ALIBI.,The prisoner was now arraigned
2703,AN ALIBI.,And said that he was greatly pained
2704,AN ALIBI.,"To be suspected--_he_, whose pen"
2705,AN ALIBI.,Had charged so many other men
2706,AN ALIBI.,"With crimes and misdemeanors! ""Why,"""
2707,AN ALIBI.,"He said, a tear in either eye,"
2708,AN ALIBI.,"""If men who live by crying out"
2709,AN ALIBI.,'Stop thief!' are not themselves from doubt
2710,AN ALIBI.,"Of their integrity exempt,"
2711,AN ALIBI.,Let all forego the vain attempt
2712,AN ALIBI.,"To make a reputation! Sir,"
2713,AN ALIBI.,"I'm innocent, and I demur."""
2714,AN ALIBI.,Whereat a thousand voices cried
2715,AN ALIBI.,Amain he manifestly lied--
2716,AN ALIBI.,_Vox populi_ as loudly roared
2717,AN ALIBI.,"As bull by _picadores_ gored,"
2718,AN ALIBI.,In his own coin receiving pay
2719,AN ALIBI.,To make a Spanish holiday.
2720,AN ALIBI.,
2721,AN ALIBI.,The jury--twelve good men and true--
2722,AN ALIBI.,"Were then sworn in to see it through,"
2723,AN ALIBI.,And each made solemn oath that he
2724,AN ALIBI.,As any babe unborn was free
2725,AN ALIBI.,"From prejudice, opinion, thought,"
2726,AN ALIBI.,"Respectability, brains--aught"
2727,AN ALIBI.,That could disqualify; and some
2728,AN ALIBI.,Explained that they were deaf and dumb.
2729,AN ALIBI.,"A better twelve, his Honor said,"
2730,AN ALIBI.,"Was rare, except among the dead."
2731,AN ALIBI.,The witnesses were called and sworn.
2732,AN ALIBI.,"The tales they told made angels mourn,"
2733,AN ALIBI.,And the Good Book they'd kissed became
2734,AN ALIBI.,Red with the consciousness of shame.
2735,AN ALIBI.,
2736,AN ALIBI.,Whenever one of them approached
2737,AN ALIBI.,"The truth, ""That witness wasn't coached,"
2738,AN ALIBI.,"Your Honor!"" cried the lawyers both."
2739,AN ALIBI.,"""Strike out his testimony,"" quoth"
2740,AN ALIBI.,"The learned judge: ""This Court denies"
2741,AN ALIBI.,Its ear to stories which surprise.
2742,AN ALIBI.,I hold that witnesses exempt
2743,AN ALIBI.,"From coaching all are in contempt."""
2744,AN ALIBI.,Both Prosecution and Defense
2745,AN ALIBI.,"Applauded the judicial sense,"
2746,AN ALIBI.,And the spectators all averred
2747,AN ALIBI.,Such wisdom they had never heard:
2748,AN ALIBI.,'Twas plain the prisoner would be
2749,AN ALIBI.,Found guilty in the first degree.
2750,AN ALIBI.,Meanwhile that wight's pale cheek confessed
2751,AN ALIBI.,The nameless terrors in his breast.
2752,AN ALIBI.,"He felt remorseful, too, because"
2753,AN ALIBI.,He wasn't half they said he was.
2754,AN ALIBI.,"""If I'd been such a rogue,"" he mused"
2755,AN ALIBI.,"On opportunities unused,"
2756,AN ALIBI.,"""I might have easily become"
2757,AN ALIBI.,"As wealthy as Methusalum."""
2758,AN ALIBI.,"This journalist adorned, alas,"
2759,AN ALIBI.,"The middle, not the Bible, class."
2760,AN ALIBI.,
2761,AN ALIBI.,With equal skill the lawyers' pleas
2762,AN ALIBI.,Attested their divided fees.
2763,AN ALIBI.,"Each gave the other one the lie,"
2764,AN ALIBI.,Then helped him frame a sharp reply.
2765,AN ALIBI.,
2766,AN ALIBI.,"Good Lord! it was a bitter fight,"
2767,AN ALIBI.,And lasted all the day and night.
2768,AN ALIBI.,When once or oftener the roar
2769,AN ALIBI.,Had silenced the judicial snore
2770,AN ALIBI.,The speaker suffered for the sport
2771,AN ALIBI.,By fining for contempt of court.
2772,AN ALIBI.,Twelve jurors' noses good and true
2773,AN ALIBI.,"Unceasing sang the trial through,"
2774,AN ALIBI.,And even _vox populi_ was spent
2775,AN ALIBI.,In rattles through a nasal vent.
2776,AN ALIBI.,"Clerk, bailiff, constables and all"
2777,AN ALIBI.,Heard Morpheus sound the trumpet call
2778,AN ALIBI.,To arms--his arms--and all fell in
2779,AN ALIBI.,Save counsel for the Man of Sin.
2780,AN ALIBI.,That thaumaturgist stood and swayed
2781,AN ALIBI.,The wand their faculties obeyed--
2782,AN ALIBI.,"That magic wand which, like a flame."
2783,AN ALIBI.,"Leapt, wavered, quivered and became"
2784,AN ALIBI.,A wonder-worker--known among
2785,AN ALIBI.,The ignoble vulgar as a Tongue.
2786,AN ALIBI.,
2787,AN ALIBI.,"How long, O Lord, how long my verse"
2788,AN ALIBI.,Runs on for better or for worse
2789,AN ALIBI.,"In meter which o'ermasters me,"
2790,AN ALIBI.,Octosyllabically free!--
2791,AN ALIBI.,"A meter which, the poets say,"
2792,AN ALIBI.,No power of restraint can stay;--
2793,AN ALIBI.,"A hard-mouthed meter, suited well"
2794,AN ALIBI.,"To him who, having naught to tell,"
2795,AN ALIBI.,Must hold attention as a trout
2796,AN ALIBI.,"Is held, by paying out and out"
2797,AN ALIBI.,The slender line which else would break
2798,AN ALIBI.,Should one attempt the fish to take.
2799,AN ALIBI.,Thus tavern guides who've naught to show
2800,AN ALIBI.,But some adjacent curio
2801,AN ALIBI.,By devious trails their patrons lead
2802,AN ALIBI.,And make them think 't is far indeed.
2803,AN ALIBI.,Where was I?
2804,AN ALIBI.,
2805,AN ALIBI.,While the lawyer talked
2806,AN ALIBI.,The rogue took up his feet and walked:
2807,AN ALIBI.,"While all about him, roaring, slept,"
2808,AN ALIBI.,Into the street he calmly stepped.
2809,AN ALIBI.,"In very truth, the man who thought"
2810,AN ALIBI.,The people's voice from heaven had caught
2811,AN ALIBI.,God's inspiration took a change
2812,AN ALIBI.,Of venue--it was passing strange!
2813,AN ALIBI.,Straight to his editor he went
2814,AN ALIBI.,And that ingenious person sent
2815,AN ALIBI.,A Negro to impersonate
2816,AN ALIBI.,The fugitive. In adequate
2817,AN ALIBI.,Disguise he took his vacant place
2818,AN ALIBI.,And buried in his arms his face.
2819,AN ALIBI.,When all was done the lawyer stopped
2820,AN ALIBI.,And silence like a bombshell dropped
2821,AN ALIBI.,"Upon the Court: judge, jury, all"
2822,AN ALIBI.,Within that venerable hall
2823,AN ALIBI.,"(Except the deaf and dumb, indeed,"
2824,AN ALIBI.,And one or two whom death had freed)
2825,AN ALIBI.,Awoke and tried to look as though
2826,AN ALIBI.,Slumber was all they did not know.
2827,AN ALIBI.,
2828,AN ALIBI.,And now that tireless lawyer-man
2829,AN ALIBI.,"Took breath, and then again began:"
2830,AN ALIBI.,"""Your Honor, if you did attend"
2831,AN ALIBI.,To what I've urged (my learned friend
2832,AN ALIBI.,Nodded concurrence) to support
2833,AN ALIBI.,"The motion I have made, this court"
2834,AN ALIBI.,May soon adjourn. With your assent
2835,AN ALIBI.,I've shown abundant precedent
2836,AN ALIBI.,"For introducing now, though late,"
2837,AN ALIBI.,New evidence to exculpate
2838,AN ALIBI.,"My client. So, if you'll allow,"
2839,AN ALIBI.,"I'll prove an _alibi_!"" ""What?--how?"""
2840,AN ALIBI.,"Stammered the judge. ""Well, yes, I can't"
2841,AN ALIBI.,"Deny your showing, and I grant"
2842,AN ALIBI.,The motion. Do I understand
2843,AN ALIBI.,You undertake to prove--good land!--
2844,AN ALIBI.,That when the crime--you mean to show
2845,AN ALIBI.,"Your client wasn't _there_?"" ""O, no,"
2846,AN ALIBI.,"I cannot quite do that, I find:"
2847,AN ALIBI.,My _alibi's_ another kind
2848,AN ALIBI.,"Of _alibi_,--I'll make it clear,"
2849,AN ALIBI.,"Your Honor, that he isn't _here_."""
2850,AN ALIBI.,"The Darky here upreared his head,"

2982,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,That he'd get drunk as twenty lords.
2983,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,
2984,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,He'd get so truly drunk that men
2985,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,Stood by to marvel at him when
2986,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,His slow advance along the street
2987,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,Was but a vain cycloidal feat.

2989,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,And when 'twas fated that he fall
2990,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,"With a wide geographical sprawl,"
2991,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,They signified assent by sounds
2992,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,Heard (faintly) at its utmost bounds.

2994,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,And yet this Mr. Shanahan
2995,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,(Who was a most ingenious man)
2996,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,Cast not on wine his thirsty eyes

3022,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,In kind of thirst than in degree;
3023,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,
3024,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,For sometimes fifty souls would pay
3025,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,The debt of nature in a day

3029,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,"His native land, proud of its sense"

3034,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,And some the boldness had to say

3051,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,Which now had grown so truly great
3052,THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.,It was a drain upon the State.

4231,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,"The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled,"

4262,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,Ere merriment or anger o'er amazement could prevail;
4263,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,He cut the string that held the stone on that canary's tail.
4264,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,"Freed from the weight, that member made a gesture of delight,"
4265,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,Then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite.
4266,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,"With lifted head and level ears along his withers laid,"
4267,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,"Jack sighed, refilled his lungs and then--to put it mildly--brayed!"
4268,MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.,"He brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills,"

5086,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Once on a time, so ancient poets sing,"
5087,THE ROYAL JESTER.,There reigned in Godknowswhere a certain king.
5088,THE ROYAL JESTER.,So great a monarch ne'er before was seen:
5089,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"He was a hero, even to his queen,"
5090,THE ROYAL JESTER.,In whose respect he held so high a place
5091,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"That none was higher,--nay, not even the ace."
5092,THE ROYAL JESTER.,He was so just his Parliament declared
5093,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Those subjects happy whom his laws had spared;
5094,THE ROYAL JESTER.,So wise that none of the debating throng
5095,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Had ever lived to prove him in the wrong;
5096,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"So good that Crime his anger never feared,"
5097,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And Beauty boldly plucked him by the beard;
5098,THE ROYAL JESTER.,So brave that if his army got a beating
5099,THE ROYAL JESTER.,None dared to face him when he was retreating.
5100,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"This monarch kept a Fool to make his mirth,"
5101,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And loved him tenderly despite his worth.
5102,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Prompted by what caprice I cannot say,"
5103,THE ROYAL JESTER.,He called the Fool before the throne one day
5104,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And to that jester seriously said:

5106,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"While I, attired in motley, will make sport"
5107,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"To entertain your Majesty and Court."""
5108,THE ROYAL JESTER.,
5109,THE ROYAL JESTER.,'T was done and the Fool governed. He decreed
5110,THE ROYAL JESTER.,The time of harvest and the time of seed;
5111,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Ordered the rains and made the weather clear,"
5112,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And had a famine every second year;

5114,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Ordaining six whole holidays a week;
5115,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Religious creeds and sacred books prepared;
5116,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Made war when angry and made peace when scared.
5117,THE ROYAL JESTER.,New taxes he inspired; new laws he made;
5118,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Drowned those who broke them, who observed them, flayed,"
5119,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"In short, he ruled so well that all who'd not"
5120,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Been starved, decapitated, hanged or shot"
5121,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Made the whole country with his praises ring,"

5136,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"A long, bright smile, that glittered in the gloom"

5138,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Posing his bauble like a leader's staff,"
5139,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"To give the signal when (and why) to laugh,"

5151,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Rose as one man--the very dead arose,"
5152,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Springing indignant from the riven tomb,"
5153,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And babes unborn leapt swearing from the womb!
5154,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"All to the Council Chamber clamoring went,"
5155,THE ROYAL JESTER.,By rage distracted and on vengeance bent.
5156,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"In that vast hall, in due disorder laid,"
5157,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"The tools of legislation were displayed,"
5158,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"And the wild populace, its wrath to sate,"
5159,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Seized them and heaved them at the Jester's pate.
5160,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Mountains of writing paper; pools and seas
5161,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Of ink, awaiting, to become decrees,"
5162,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Royal approval--and the same in stacks
5163,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Lay ready for attachment, backed with wax;"
5164,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Pens to make laws, erasers to amend them;"
5165,THE ROYAL JESTER.,With mucilage convenient to extend them;
5166,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Scissors for limiting their application,"
5167,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And acids to repeal all legislation--
5168,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"These, flung as missiles till the air was dense,"
5169,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Were most offensive weapons of offense,"
5170,THE ROYAL JESTER.,And by their aid the Fool was nigh destroyed.
5171,THE ROYAL JESTER.,They ne'er had been so harmlessly employed.
5172,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Whelmed underneath a load of legal cap,"
5173,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"His mouth egurgitating ink on tap,"
5174,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"His eyelids mucilaginously sealed,"

5176,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"Abundant harvestage of ears, his pelt,"
5177,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"In every wrinkle and on every welt,"
5178,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Quickset with pencil-points from feet to gills
5179,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"And thickly studded with a pride of quills,"
5180,THE ROYAL JESTER.,The royal Jester in the dreadful strife
5181,THE ROYAL JESTER.,Was made (in short) an editor for life!
5182,THE ROYAL JESTER.,
5183,THE ROYAL JESTER.,"An idle tale, and yet a moral lurks"

7428,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,
7429,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,One day there came to visit Sally's dad as sleek and smart
7430,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,A chap as ever wandered there from any foreign part.
7431,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,Though his gentle birth and breeding he did not at all obtrude
7432,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,It was somehow whispered round he was a simon-pure Dude.
7433,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"Howsoe'er that may have been, it was conspicuous to see"
7434,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,That he _was_ a real Gent of an uncommon high degree.

7436,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"On this exquisite creation was, of course, upon the cards;"

7442,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,One evening--'twas in summer--she was holding in her lap

7449,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"Then sighs of amorosity from Sally L. exhaled,"
7450,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,And her music apparatus sympathetically wailed.
7451,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"""In the gloaming, O my darling!"" rose that wild impassioned strain,"
7452,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"And her eyes were fixed on his with an intensity of pain,"
7453,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,"Till the ranch-dog from his kennel at the postern gate came round,"
7454,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,And going into session strove to magnify the sound.
7455,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,He lifted up his spirit till the gloaming rang and rang
7456,THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.,With the song that to _his_ darling he impetuously sang!

8796,DIES IRAE.,
8797,DIES IRAE.,A recent republication of the late Gen. John A. Dix's disappointing
8798,DIES IRAE.,"translation of this famous medieval hymn, together with some researches"
8799,DIES IRAE.,"into its history which I happened to be making at the time, induces me"
8800,DIES IRAE.,to undertake a translation myself. It may seem presumption in me to
8801,DIES IRAE.,attempt that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have
8802,DIES IRAE.,attempted before me; but the conspicuous failure of others encourages me
8803,DIES IRAE.,"to hope that success, being still unachieved, is still achievable. The"
8804,DIES IRAE.,"fault of previous translations, from Lord Macaulay's to that of Gen."
8805,DIES IRAE.,"Dix, has been, I venture to think, a too strict literalness, whereby the"
8806,DIES IRAE.,delicate irony and subtle humor of the immortal poem--though doubtless
8807,DIES IRAE.,these admirable qualities were well appreciated by the translators--have
8808,DIES IRAE.,been utterly sacrificed in the result. In none of the English versions
8809,DIES IRAE.,that I have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of
8810,DIES IRAE.,"insincerity pervading the whole prayer,--the cool effrontery of the"
8811,DIES IRAE.,"suppliant in enumerating his demerits, his serenely illogical demands of"
8812,DIES IRAE.,"salvation in spite, or rather because, of them, his meek submission"
8813,DIES IRAE.,"to the punishment of others, and the many similarly pleasing"
8814,DIES IRAE.,"characteristics of this amusing work, being most imperfectly conveyed."
8815,DIES IRAE.,By permitting myself a reasonable freedom of rendering--in many cases
8816,DIES IRAE.,"boldly supplying that ""missing link"" between the sublime and the"
8817,DIES IRAE.,"ridiculous which the author, writing for the acute monkish apprehension"
8818,DIES IRAE.,"of the 13th century, did not deem it necessary to insert--I have hoped"
8819,DIES IRAE.,at least partially to liberate the lurking devil of humor from his
8820,DIES IRAE.,"fetters, letting him caper, not, certainly, as he does in the Latin, but"
8821,DIES IRAE.,as he probably would have done had his creator written in English. In
8822,DIES IRAE.,"preserving the metre and double rhymes of the original, I have acted"
8823,DIES IRAE.,"from the same reverent regard for the music with which, in the liturgy"
8824,DIES IRAE.,"of the Church, the verses have become inseparably wedded that inspired"
8825,DIES IRAE.,Gen. Dix; seeking rather to surmount the obstacles to success by honest
8826,DIES IRAE.,"effort, than to avoid them by the adoption of an easier versification"
8827,DIES IRAE.,which would have deprived my version of all utility in religious
8828,DIES IRAE.,service.

9491,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,Of echoes mocking his accurst harangue;
9492,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"So the dull clown, untraveled though at large,"
9493,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"Visits the city on the ocean's marge,"
9494,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,Expands his eyes and marvels to remark
9495,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,Each coastwise schooner and each alien bark;
9496,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"Prates of ""all nations,"" wonders as he stares"
9497,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"That native merchants sell imported wares,"
9498,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,Nor comprehends how in his very view
9499,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,A foreign vessel has a foreign crew;
9500,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"Yet, faithful to the hamlet of his birth,"
9501,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"Swears it superior to aught on earth,"
9502,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,Sighs for the temples locally renowned--
9503,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,The village school-house and the village pound--
9504,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,And chalks upon the palaces of Rome
9505,HOMO PODUNKENSIS.,"The peasant sentiments of ""Home, Sweet Home!"""

9511,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9512,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9513,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Well, well, old Father Christmas, is it you,"
9514,A SOCIAL CALL.,With your thick neck and thin pretense of virtue?
9515,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Less redness in the nose--nay, even some blue"
9516,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Would not, I think, particularly hurt you."
9517,A SOCIAL CALL.,"When seen close to, not mounted in your car,"
9518,A SOCIAL CALL.,You look the drunkard and the pig you are.
9519,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9520,A SOCIAL CALL.,"No matter, sit you down, for I am not"
9521,A SOCIAL CALL.,"In a gray study, as you sometimes find me."
9522,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Merry? O, no, nor wish to be, God wot,"
9523,A SOCIAL CALL.,But there's another year of pain behind me.
9524,A SOCIAL CALL.,That's something to be thankful for: the more
9525,A SOCIAL CALL.,"There are behind, the fewer are before."
9526,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9527,A SOCIAL CALL.,"I know you, Father Christmas, for a scamp,"
9528,A SOCIAL CALL.,But Heaven endowed me at my soul's creation
9529,A SOCIAL CALL.,With an affinity to every tramp
9530,A SOCIAL CALL.,That walks the world and steals its admiration.
9531,A SOCIAL CALL.,For admiration is like linen left
9532,A SOCIAL CALL.,Upon the line--got easiest by theft.
9533,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9534,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Good God! old man, just think of it! I've stood,"
9535,A SOCIAL CALL.,"With brains and honesty, some five-and-twenty"
9536,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Long years as champion of all that's good,"
9537,A SOCIAL CALL.,And taken on the mazzard thwacks a-plenty.
9538,A SOCIAL CALL.,Yet now whose praises do the people bawl?
9539,A SOCIAL CALL.,Those of the fellows whom I live to maul!
9540,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9541,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Why, this is odd!--the more I try to talk"
9542,A SOCIAL CALL.,Of you the more my tongue grows egotistic
9543,A SOCIAL CALL.,To prattle of myself! I'll try to balk
9544,A SOCIAL CALL.,Its waywardness and be more altruistic.
9545,A SOCIAL CALL.,"So let us speak of others--how they sin,"
9546,A SOCIAL CALL.,And what a devil of a state they 're in!
9547,A SOCIAL CALL.,
9548,A SOCIAL CALL.,"That's all I have to say. Good-bye, old man."
9549,A SOCIAL CALL.,Next year you possibly may find me scolding--
9550,A SOCIAL CALL.,Or miss me altogether: Nature's plan
9551,A SOCIAL CALL.,"Includes, as I suppose, a final folding"
9552,A SOCIAL CALL.,Of these poor empty hands. Then drop a tear
9553,A SOCIAL CALL.,To think they'll never box another ear.
