123,PRELUDE.,PRELUDE.
124,PRELUDE.,
125,PRELUDE.,"Why, dreams from dreams in dreams remembered! naught"
126,PRELUDE.,"Save this, alas! that once it seemed I thought"
127,PRELUDE.,"I wandered dim with someone, but I knew"
128,PRELUDE.,"Not who; most beautiful and good and true,"
129,PRELUDE.,"Yet sad through suffering; with curl-crowned brow,"
130,PRELUDE.,Soft eyes and voice; so white she haunts me now:--
131,PRELUDE.,"And when, and where?--At night in dreamland."
132,PRELUDE.,She
133,PRELUDE.,Led me athwart a flower-showered lea
134,PRELUDE.,Where trammeled puckered pansy and the pea;
135,PRELUDE.,"Spread stains of pale-rod poppies rinced of rain,"
136,PRELUDE.,So gorged with sun their hurt hearts ached with pain;
137,PRELUDE.,"Heaped honeysuckles; roses lavishing beams,"
138,PRELUDE.,Wherein I knew were huddled little dreams
139,PRELUDE.,"Which laughed coy, hidden merriment and there"
140,PRELUDE.,Blew quick gay kisses fragrancing the air.
141,PRELUDE.,And where a river bubbled through the sward
142,PRELUDE.,A mist lay sleepily; and it was hard
143,PRELUDE.,"To see whence sprung it, to what seas it led,"
144,PRELUDE.,How broadly spread and what it was it fled
145,PRELUDE.,"So ceasless in its sighs, and bickering on"
146,PRELUDE.,Into romance or some bewildering dawn
147,PRELUDE.,Of wisest legend from the storied wells
148,PRELUDE.,"Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,"
149,PRELUDE.,"Nodding a white poll and a grand, gray beard"
150,PRELUDE.,"As if some Lake Ladyé he, listening, heard,"
151,PRELUDE.,"Who spake like water, danced like careful showers"
152,PRELUDE.,With blown gold curls thro' drifts of wild-thorn flowers;
153,PRELUDE.,"Loose, lazy arms in graceful movement tossed,"
154,PRELUDE.,"Float flower-like down a woodland vista, lost"
155,PRELUDE.,In some peculiar note that wrings a tear
156,PRELUDE.,Slow down his withered cheek. And then steals near
157,PRELUDE.,"Her sweet, lascivious brow's white wonderment,"
158,PRELUDE.,"And gray rude eyes, and hair which hath the scent"
159,PRELUDE.,Of the wildwood Brécéliand's perfumes
160,PRELUDE.,In Brittany; and in it one red bloom's
161,PRELUDE.,"Blood-drop thrust deep, and so ""Sweet Viviane!"""
162,PRELUDE.,"All the glad leaves lisp like a young, soft rain"
163,PRELUDE.,"From top to top, until a running surge"
164,PRELUDE.,"The dark, witch-haunted solitude will urge,"
165,PRELUDE.,That shakes and sounds and stammers as from sleep
166,PRELUDE.,Some giant were aroused; and with a leap
167,PRELUDE.,"A samite-gauzy creature, glossy white,"
168,PRELUDE.,"Showers mocking kisses fast and, like a light"
169,PRELUDE.,"Beat by a gust to flutter and then done,"
170,PRELUDE.,From Brécéliande and Merlin she is gone.
171,PRELUDE.,But still he sits there drowsing with his dreams;
172,PRELUDE.,A wondrous cohort hath he; many as gleams
173,PRELUDE.,That stab the moted mazes of a beech;
174,PRELUDE.,And each grave dream hath its own magic speech
175,PRELUDE.,To sting to tears his old eyes heavy--two
176,PRELUDE.,"Hang, tangled brilliants, in his beard like dew:"
177,PRELUDE.,"And still faint murmurs of courts brave and fair,"
178,PRELUDE.,"And forms of Arthur and proud Guenevere,"
179,PRELUDE.,"Grave Tristram and rare Isoud and stout Mark,"
180,PRELUDE.,"Bold Launcelot, chaste Galahad the dark"
181,PRELUDE.,"Of his weak mind, once strong, glares up with, then,"
182,PRELUDE.,--The instant's fostered blossoms--die again.
183,PRELUDE.,"A roar of tournament, a rippling stir"
184,PRELUDE.,"Of silken lists that ramble into her,"
185,PRELUDE.,"That white witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,"
186,PRELUDE.,The vast Brécéliande and dreams again.
187,PRELUDE.,"Then Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, trips there,"
188,PRELUDE.,A waggish cunning; glittering on his hair
189,PRELUDE.,A tinsel crown; and then will slightly sway
190,PRELUDE.,"Thick leaves and part, and there Morgane the Fay"
191,PRELUDE.,With haughty wicked eyes and lovely face
192,PRELUDE.,Studies him steady for a little space.
193,PRELUDE.,
194,PRELUDE.,
195,I.,I.
196,I.,
197,I.,"""Thou askest with thy studious eyes again,"
198,I.,Here where the restless forest hears the main
199,I.,"Toss in a troubled sleep and moan. Ah, sweet,"
200,I.,With joy and passion the kind hour's replete;
201,I.,And what wild beauty here! where roughly run
202,I.,"Huge forest shadows from the westering sun,"
203,I.,The wood's a subdued power gentle as
204,I.,"Yon tame wild-things, that in the moss and grass"
205,I.,Gaze with their human eyes. Here grow the lines
206,I.,Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines
207,I.,"Urned in its tremulous ferns, rest we upon"
208,I.,This oak-trunk of God's thunder overthrown
209,I.,"Years, years agone; not where 'tis rotted brown"
210,I.,But where the thick bark's firm and overgrown
211,I.,Of clambering ivy blackly berried; where
212,I.,"Wild musk of wood decay just tincts the air,"
213,I.,"As if some strange shrub on some whispering way,"
214,I.,"In some dewed dell, while dreaming of one May,"
215,I.,In longing languor weakly tried to wake
216,I.,One sometime blossom and could only make
217,I.,"Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew,"
218,I.,"And shape a specter, budding thin as dew,"
219,I.,To haunt these sounding miles of solitude.
220,I.,"Troubled thou askest, Morgane, and the mood,"
221,I.,"Unfathomed in thine eyes, glows rash and deep"
222,I.,As that in some wild-woman's found on sleep
223,I.,"By some lost knight upon a precipice,"
224,I.,Whom he hath wakened with a laughing kiss.
225,I.,"As that of some frail, elfin lady white"
226,I.,"As if of watery moonbeams, filmy dight,"
227,I.,Who waves diaphanous beauty on some cliff
228,I.,That drowsing purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if
229,I.,"The lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag"
230,I.,"Him crashing down, while she, tall on the crag,"
231,I.,Triumphant mocks him with glad sorcery
232,I.,Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee.
233,I.,"As that bewildering mystery of a tarn,"
234,I.,"Some mountain water, which the mornings scorn"
235,I.,To anadem with fire and leave gray;
236,I.,To which some champion cometh when the Day
237,I.,"Hath tired of breding on his proud, young head"
238,I.,"Flame-furry blooms and, golden chapletéd,"
239,I.,"Sits rosy, trembling with full love for Night,"
240,I.,Who cometh sandaled; dark in crape; the light
241,I.,Of her good eyes a marvel; her vast hair
242,I.,"Tortuous with stars,--as in some shadowy lair"
243,I.,"The eyes of hunted wild things burn with rage,--"
244,I.,And on large bosoms doth his love assuage.
245,I.,
246,I.,"""He, coming thither in that haunted place,"
247,I.,"Stoops low to quaff cool waters, when his face"
248,I.,Meets gurgling fairy faces in a ring
249,I.,That jostle upward babbling; beckoning
250,I.,Him deep to wonders secret built of old
251,I.,"By some dim witch: 'A city walled with gold,"
252,I.,"With beryl battlements and paved with pearls,"
253,I.,"Slim, lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls"
254,I.,"Of alabaster, and that witch to love,"
255,I.,More beautiful to love than queens above.'--
256,I.,"He pauses troubled, but a wizard power,"
257,I.,In all his bronzen harness that mad hour
258,I.,Plunges him--whither? what if he should miss
259,I.,Those cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?
260,I.,"Ah, Morgane, that same power Accolon"
261,I.,Saw potent in thine eyes and it hath drawn
262,I.,Him deep to plunge--and to what breathless fate?--
263,I.,"Bliss?--which, too true, he hath well quaffed of late!"
264,I.,"But, there!--may come what stealthy-footed Death"
265,I.,With bony claws to clutch away his breath!
266,I.,"And make him loveless to those eyes, alas!--"
267,I.,Fain must I speak that vision; thus it was:
268,I.,
269,I.,"""In sleep one plucked me some warm fleurs-de-lis,"
270,I.,Larger than those of earth; and I might see
271,I.,"Their woolly gold, loose, webby woven thro',--"
272,I.,"Like fluffy flames spun,--gauzy with fine dew."
273,I.,"And 'asphodels!' I murmured; then, 'these sure"
274,I.,"The Eden amaranths, so angel pure"
275,I.,That these alone may pluck them; aye and aye!
276,I.,"But with that giving, lo, she passed away"
277,I.,"Beyond me on some misty, yearning brook"
278,I.,"With some sweet song, which all the wild air took"
279,I.,With torn farewells and pensive melody
280,I.,"Touching to tears, strange, hopeless utterly."
281,I.,So merciless sweet that I yearned high to tear
282,I.,Those ingot-cored and gold-crowned lilies fair;
283,I.,Yet over me a horror which restrained
284,I.,With melancholy presence of two pained
285,I.,"And awful, mighty eyes that cowed and held"
286,I.,Me weeping while that sad dirge died or swelled
287,I.,"Far, far on endless waters borne away:"
288,I.,A wild bird's musick smitten when the ray
289,I.,"Of dawn it burned for graced its drooping head,"
290,I.,And the pale glory strengthened round it dead;
291,I.,"Daggered of thorns it plunged on, blind in night,"
292,I.,The slow blood ruby on its plumage white.
293,I.,
294,I.,"""Then, then I knew these blooms which she had given"
295,I.,Were strays of parting grief and waifs of Heaven
296,I.,For tears and memories; too delicate
297,I.,For eyes of earth such souls immaculate!
298,I.,But then--my God! my God! thus these were left!
299,I.,I knew then still! but of that song bereft--
300,I.,That rapturous wonder grasping after grief--
301,I.,"Beyond all thought--weak thought that would be thief."""
302,I.,And bowed and wept into his hands and she
303,I.,Sorrowful beheld; and resting at her knee
304,I.,Raised slow her oblong lute and smote its chords;
305,I.,But ere the impulse saddened into words
306,I.,"Said: ""And didst love me as thy lips have spake"
307,I.,No visions wrought of sleep might such love shake.
308,I.,"Fast is all Love in fastness of his power,"
309,I.,With flame reverberant moated stands his tower;
310,I.,Not so built as to chink from fact a beam
311,I.,Of doubt and much less of a doubt from dream;
312,I.,"_Such_, the alchemic fires of Love's desires,"
313,I.,"Which hug this like a snake, melt to gold wires"
314,I.,"To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres."""
315,I.,"So ceased and then, sad softness in her eye"
316,I.,Sang to his dream a questioning reply:
317,I.,
318,I.,"""Will love grow less when dead the roguish Spring,"
319,I.,Who from gay eyes sowed violets whispering;
320,I.,"Peach petals in wild cheeks, wan-wasted thro'"
321,I.,"Of withering grief, laid lovely 'neath the dew,"
322,I.,Will love grow less?
323,I.,
324,I.,"""Will love grow less when comes queen Summer tall,"
325,I.,Her throat a lily long and spiritual;
326,I.,Rich as the poppied swaths--droned haunts of bees--
327,I.,"Her cheeks, a brown maid's gleaning on the leas,"
328,I.,Will love grow less?
329,I.,
330,I.,"""Will love grow less when Autumn sighing there"
331,I.,"Broods with long frost streaks in her dark, dark hair;"
332,I.,"Tears in grave eyes as in grave heavens above,"
333,I.,"Deep lost in memories' melancholy, love,"
334,I.,Will love grow less?
335,I.,
336,I.,"""Will love grow less when Winter at the door"
337,I.,Begs on her scant locks icicles as hoar;
338,I.,While Death's eyes hollow o'er her shoulder dart
339,I.,"A look to wring to tears then freeze the heart,"
340,I.,"Will love grow less?"""
341,I.,
342,I.,And in her hair wept softly and her breast
343,I.,"Rose and was wet with tears; like as, distressed,"
344,I.,Night steals on Day rain sobbing thro' her curls.
345,I.,"""Tho' tears become thee even as priceless pearls,"
346,I.,"Weep not for love's sake! mine no gloom of doubt,"
347,I.,But woe for sweet love's death such dreams brought out.
348,I.,"Nay, nay; crowned, throned and flame-anointed he"
349,I.,Kings our twin-kingdomed hearts eternally.
350,I.,"Love, high in Heaven beginning and to cease"
351,I.,No majesty when hearts are laid at peace;
352,I.,"But reign supreme, if souls have wrought as well,"
353,I.,A god in Heaven or a god in Hell.
354,I.,"Yea, Morgane, for the favor of his face"
355,I.,All our rich world of love I will retrace:
356,I.,
357,I.,"""Hurt in that battle where thy brother strove"
358,I.,"With those five kings thou wot'st of, dearest love,"
359,I.,"Wherein the five were worsted, I was brought"
360,I.,"To some king's castle on my shield, methought,--"
361,I.,"Out of the grind of spears and roar of swords,"
362,I.,"From the loud shields of battle-bloody lords,"
363,I.,Culled from the mountained slain where Havoc sprawled
364,I.,"Gorged to her eyes with carnage, growling crawled;--"
365,I.,By some tall damsels tiremaids of some queen
366,I.,"Stately and dark, who moved as if a sheen"
367,I.,Of starlight spread her presence; and she came
368,I.,With healing herbs and searched my wounds. A dame
369,I.,So marvelous in raiment silvery
370,I.,I feared lest some attendant chaste were she
371,I.,"To that high Holy Grael, which Arthur hath"
372,I.,Sought ever widely by hoar wood and path;--
373,I.,"Thus not for me, a worldly one, to love,"
374,I.,Who loved her even to wonder; skied above
375,I.,"His worship as our moon above the Main,"
376,I.,"That passions upward yearning in great pain,"
377,I.,"And suffers wearily from year to year,"
378,I.,She peaceful pitiless with virgin cheer.--
379,I.,"Ah, ideal love, as merciless as fate!"
380,I.,"And, oh, that savage aching which must wait"
381,I.,"For its fulfillment, tortured love in tears,"
382,I.,Until that beauty dreamed of many years
383,I.,"Bends over one from luminous skies, so grand"
384,I.,"One's weakness fears to touch its mastering hand,"
385,I.,"And hesitates and stammers nothings weak,"
386,I.,And loves and loves with love that can not speak!
387,I.,"Ah, there's the tyranny that breeds despair;"
388,I.,Breaks hearts whose strong youth by one golden hair
389,I.,Coiled 'round the throat is sooner strangled dumb
390,I.,Than by a glancing dagger thrust from gloom
391,I.,Of an old arras at the very hour
392,I.,One thought one safest in one's guarded tower.--
393,I.,"Thus, Morgane, worshiping that lady I"
394,I.,"Was speechless; longing now to live, now die,"
395,I.,As her fine face suggested secrets of
396,I.,"Some passion kin to mine, or scorn of love"
397,I.,"That dragged heroic humbleness to her feet,"
398,I.,For one long look that spake and made such sweet.
399,I.,"Ah, never dreamed I of what was to be,--"
400,I.,Nay! nay! how could I? while that agony
401,I.,"Of doubtful love denied my heart too much,"
402,I.,Too much to dream of that perfection such
403,I.,As was to grant me boisterous hours of life
404,I.,And sever all the past as with a knife!
405,I.,
406,I.,"""One night a tempest scourged and beat and lashed"
407,I.,The writhing forest and vast thunders crashed
408,I.,"Clamorous with clubs of leven, and anon,"
409,I.,"Between the thunder pauses, seas would groan"
410,I.,Like some enormous curse a knight hath lured
411,I.,From where it soared to maim it with his sword.
412,I.,"I, with eyes partly lidded, seemed to see"
413,I.,"That cloudy, wide-wrenched night's eternity"
414,I.,Yawn hells of golden ghastliness; and sweep
415,I.,Distending foams tempestuous up each steep
416,I.,"Of furious iron, where pale mermaids sit"
417,I.,"With tangled hair black-blown, who, bit by bit,"
418,I.,Chant glimmering; beckoning on to strangling arms
419,I.,Some hurt bark hurrying in the ravenous storm's
420,I.,Resistless exultation; till there came
421,I.,"One breaker mounting inward, all aflame"
422,I.,"With glow-worm green, to boom against the cliff"
423,I.,"Its thunderous bulk--and there, sucked pale and stiff,"
424,I.,Tumbled in eddies up the howling rocks
425,I.,"My dead, drawn face; eyes lidless; matted locks"
426,I.,Oozed close with brine; tossed upward merrily
427,I.,By streaming mermaids.--Madly seemed to see
428,I.,"The vampire echoes of the hoarse wood, who,"
429,I.,"Collected, sought me; down the casement drew"
430,I.,"Wet, shuddering fingers sharply; thronging fast"
431,I.,"Up hooting turrets, fell thick screaming, cast"
432,I.,Down bastioned battlements trooped whistling off;
433,I.,From the wild woodland growled a backward scoff.--
434,I.,"Then far away, hoofs of a thousand gales,"
435,I.,"As wave rams wave up windy bluffs of Wales,"
436,I.,"Loosed from the groaning hills, the cohorts loud,"
437,I.,"Spirits of thunder, charioteered of cloud,"
438,I.,Roared down the rocking night cored with the glare
439,I.,Of fiery eyeballs swimming; their drenched hair
440,I.,"Blown black as rain unkempt back from black brows,"
441,I.,Wide mouths of storm that voiced a hell carouse
442,I.,"And bulged tight cheeks with wind, rolled riotous by"
443,I.,Ruining to ruinous cliffs to headlong die.
444,I.,
445,I.,"""Once when the lightning made the casement glare"
446,I.,"Squares touched to gold, between it rose her hair,"
447,I.,As if a raven's wing had cut the storm
448,I.,Death-driven seaward; and a vague alarm
449,I.,Stung me with terrors of surmise where hope
450,I.,As yet pruned weak wings crippled by their scope.
451,I.,"And, lo, she kneeled low, radiant, wonderful,"
452,I.,"Lawn-raimented and white; kneeled low,--'to lull"
453,I.,"These thoughts of night such storms might shape in thee,"
454,I.,"All such to peace and sleep,'--Ah, God! to see"
455,I.,Her like a benediction fleshed! with her
456,I.,Hearing her voice! her cool hand wandering bare
457,I.,Wistful on feverish brow thro' long deep curls!
458,I.,To see her rich throat's carcaneted pearls
459,I.,Rise as her pulses! eyes' large influence
460,I.,"Poured toward me straight as stars, whose sole defense"
461,I.,Against all storm is their bold beauty! then
462,I.,To feel her breathe and hear her speak again!
463,I.,"'Love, mark,' I said or dreamed I moaned in dreams,"
464,I.,'How wails the tumult and the thunder gleams!
465,I.,As if of Arthur's knights had charged two fields
466,I.,"Bright as sun-winds of dawn; swords, spears and shields"
467,I.,"Flashed lordly shocked; had,--to a man gone down"
468,I.,"In burst of battle hurled,--lain silent sown."
469,I.,"Love, one eternal tempest thus with thee"
470,I.,"Were calm, dead calm! but, no!--for thee in me"
471,I.,Such calm proves tempest. Speak; I feel thy voice
472,I.,"Throb soft, caressing silence, healing noise.'"
473,I.,
474,I.,"""Is radiance loved of radiance? day of day?"
475,I.,Lithe beam of beam and laughing ray of ray?
476,I.,"Hope loved of hope and happiness of joy,"
477,I.,"Or love of love, who hath the world for toy?"
478,I.,And thou--thou lov'st my voice? fond Accolon!
479,I.,"Why not--yea, why not?--nay!--I prithee!--groan"
480,I.,Not for that thou hast had long since thine all.'
481,I.,"She smiled; and dashed down storm's black-crumbled wall,"
482,I.,"Baptizing moonlight bathed her, foot and face"
483,I.,"Deluging, as my soul brake toward her grace"
484,I.,"With worship from despair and secret grief,"
485,I.,That felt hot tears of heartsease sweet and brief.
486,I.,And one immortal night to me she said
487,I.,"Words, lay I white in death had raised me red."
488,I.,"'Rest now,' they were, 'I love thee with _such_ love!--"
489,I.,"'Some speak of secret love, but God above"
490,I.,"Hath knowledge and divinement.'... Passionate low,"
491,I.,'To lie by thee to-night my mind is':--So
492,I.,"She laughed;--'Sleep well!--for me? why, thy fast word"
493,I.,"Of knighthood, look thou, and this naked sword"
494,I.,Laid in betwixt us.... Let it be a wall
495,I.,Strong between love and lust and lov'st me all in all.'
496,I.,Undid the goodly gold from her clasped waist;
497,I.,"Unbound deep locks; and, like a blossom faced,"
498,I.,Stood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud
499,I.,In breasts and face a graceful womanhood.
500,I.,And fragrance was to her as natural
501,I.,"As odor to the rose; and she a tall,"
502,I.,White ardor and white fervor in the room
503,I.,"Moved, some pale presence that with light doth bloom."
504,I.,Then all mine eyes and lips and limbs were fire;
505,I.,"My tongue delirious throbbed a lawless lyre,"
506,I.,"That harped loud words of laud for loveliness,"
507,I.,"Inspired of such, but these I can not guess."
508,I.,"Then she, as pure as snows of peaks that keep"
509,I.,"Sun-cloven crowns of virgin, vanquishing steep,"
510,I.,"Frowned on me, and the thoughts, that in my brain"
511,I.,"Had risen a glare of gems, set dull like rain,"
512,I.,And fair I spake her and with civil pain:
513,I.,
514,I.,"""'Thine, sweet, a devil's kindness which is given"
515,I.,For earthly pleasure but bars out from Heaven.
516,I.,"Temptation harbored, like a bloody rust"
517,I.,"On a bright blade, leaves ugly stains; and lust"
518,I.,Is love's undoing when love's limbs are cast
519,I.,A commonness to desire that makes unchaste;
520,I.,And this warm nearness of what should be hid
521,I.,"Makes love a lawless love. But, thou hast bid;--"
522,I.,"Rest thou; I love thee, how,--I only know:"
523,I.,"But all that love shall shout ""out!"" at love's foe.'"
524,I.,And turning sighed into my hair; and she
525,I.,Stretched the broad blade's division suddenly.
526,I.,And so we lay its fire between us twain;
527,I.,"Unsleeping I, for, oh, that devil pain"
528,I.,Of passion in me that strove up and stood
529,I.,A rebel wrangling with the brain and blood!
530,I.,An hour stole by: she slept or seemed to sleep.
531,I.,The winds of night came vigorous from the deep
532,I.,With storm gusts of fresh-watered field and wold
533,I.,That breathed of ocean meadows bluely rolled.
534,I.,I drowsed and time passed; stealing as for one
535,I.,Whose drowsy life dreams in Avilion.
536,I.,"Vast bulks of black, wind-shattered rack went down"
537,I.,"High casement squares of heaven, a crystal crown"
538,I.,"Of bubbled moonlight on each monstrous head,"
539,I.,Like as great ghosts of giant kings long dead.
540,I.,"And then, meseemed, she lightly laughed and sighed,"
541,I.,"So soft a taper had not bent aside,"
542,I.,And leaned a soft face seen thro' loosened hair
543,I.,"Above me, whisp'ring as if sweet in prayer,"
544,I.,"'Behold, the sword! I take the sword away!'"
545,I.,It curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay;
546,I.,"Shone glassy, glittering like a watery beam"
547,I.,Of moonlight in the moonlight. I did deem
548,I.,"She moved in sleep and dreamed perverse, nor wist"
549,I.,That which she did until two fierce lips kissed
550,I.,My wondering eyes to wakement of her thought.
551,I.,"Then spake I, 'Love, my word! is it then naught?"
552,I.,"Nay, nay, my word albeit the sword be gone!--"
553,I.,And wouldst thou try me? rest thou safe till dawn!
554,I.,I will not thus forswear! my word stands fast!'
555,I.,"But now I felt hot, desperate kisses cast"
556,I.,"On hair, eyes, throat and lips and over and over,"
557,I.,Low laughter of 'Sweet wretch! and thou--a lover?
558,I.,What is that word if she thou gavest it
559,I.,"Unbind thee of it? lo, and she sees fit!'"
560,I.,"Ah, Morgane, Morgane, then I knew 'twas thou,"
561,I.,"Thou! thou! who only could such joy allow."""
562,I.,
563,I.,"""And, oh, unburied passion of that night;"
564,I.,The sleepy birds too early piped of light;
565,I.,"Too soon came Light girt with a rosy breeze,"
566,I.,"Strong from his bath, to wrestle with the trees,"
567,I.,"A thewy hero; and, alas! too soon"
568,I.,Our scutcheoned oriel stained was overstrewn
569,I.,Of Dawn's air-jewels; then I sang a strain
570,I.,Of sleep that in my memory strives again:
571,I.,
572,I.,"""Ethereal limbed the lovely Sleep should sit,"
573,I.,"Her starbeam locks with some vague splendor lit,"
574,I.,Like that the glow-worm's emerald radiance sheds
575,I.,Thro' twilight dew-drops globed on lily-beds.
576,I.,"Her face as fair as if of graven stone,"
577,I.,Yet dim and airy us a cloud alone
578,I.,"In the bare blue of Heaven, smiling sweet,"
579,I.,For languorous thoughts of love that flit and fleet
580,I.,Short-rainbow-winged about her crumpled hair;
581,I.,"Yet on her brow a pensiveness more fair,"
582,I.,"Ungraspable and sad and lost, I wist,"
583,I.,"Than thoughts of maiden whom her love hath kissed,"
584,I.,"Who knows, thro' deepening eyes and drowsy breath,"
585,I.,Him weeping bent whiles she drifts on to death.
586,I.,Full sweet and sorrowful and blithe withal
587,I.,"Should be her brow; not wholly spiritual,"
588,I.,"But tinged with mortal for the mortal mind,"
589,I.,And smote with flushings from some Eden wind;
590,I.,Hinting at heart's ease and a god's desire
591,I.,Of pleasure hastening in a garb of fire
592,I.,From some dim country over storied seas
593,I.,Glassed of content and foamed of mysteries.
594,I.,"Her ears two sea-pearls' morning-tender pink,"
595,I.,And strung to harkening as if on a brink
596,I.,"Night with profundity of death and doubt,"
597,I.,Yet touched with awfulness of light poured out.
598,I.,Ears strung to palpitations of heart throbs
599,I.,As sea-shells waver with dim ocean sobs.
600,I.,"One hand, curved like a mist on dusking skies,"
601,I.,"Hollowing smooth brows to shade dark velvet eyes,--"
602,I.,"Dark-lashed and dewed of tear-drops beautiful,--"
603,I.,"To sound the cowering conscience of the dull,"
604,I.,"Sleep-sodden features in their human rest,"
605,I.,Ere she dare trust her pureness to that breast.
606,I.,Large limbs diaphanous and fleeced with veil
607,I.,"Of wimpled heat, wove of the pulsing pale"
608,I.,"Of rosy midnight, and stained thro' with stars"
609,I.,In golden cores; clusters of quivering bars
610,I.,"Of nebulous gold, twined round her fleecily."
611,I.,A lucid shape vague in vague mystery.
612,I.,Untrammeled bosoms swelling free and white
613,I.,"And prodigal of balm; cupped lilies bright,"
614,I.,"That to the famished mind yield their pure, best,"
615,I.,"Voluptuous sleep like honey sucked in rest."""
616,I.,
617,I.,Thus they communed. And there her castle stood
618,I.,With slender towers ivied o'er the wood;
619,I.,An ancient chapel creeper-buried near;
620,I.,"A forest vista, where faint herds of deer"
621,I.,"Stalked like soft shadows; where the hares did run,"
622,I.,Mavis and throstle caroled in the sun.
623,I.,"For it was Morgane's realm, embowered Gore;"
624,I.,That rooky pile her palace whence she bore
625,I.,With Urience sway; but he at Camelot
626,I.,Knew naught of intrigues here at Chariot.
627,I.,
628,I.,
629,II.,II.
630,II.,
631,II.,Noon; and the wistful Autumn sat among
632,II.,The lurid woodlands; chiefs who now were wrung
633,II.,"By crafty ministers, sun, wind and frost,"
634,II.,To don imperial pomp at any cost.
635,II.,On each wild hill they stood as if for war
636,II.,Flaunting barbaric raiment wide and far;
637,II.,And burnt-out lusts in aged faces raged;
638,II.,"Their tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged,"
639,II.,"Who in a little fretful while, how soon!"
640,II.,Would work rebellion under some wan moon;
641,II.,Pluck their old beards deriding; shriek and tear
642,II.,Rich royalty; sow tattered through the air
643,II.,Their purple majesty; and from each head
644,II.,"Dash down its golden crown, and in its stead"
645,II.,"Set there a pale-death mockery of snow,"
646,II.,Leave them bemoaning beggars bowed with woe.
647,II.,"Blow, wood-wind, blow! now that all's fresh and fine"
648,II.,As earth and wood can make it; fresh as brine
649,II.,And rare with sodden scents of underbrush.
650,II.,"Ring, and one hears a cavalcade a-rush;"
651,II.,Bold blare of horns; shrill music of steel bows;--
652,II.,A horn! a horn! the hunt is up and goes
653,II.,"Beneath the acorn-dropping oaks in green,--"
654,II.,"Dark woodland green, a boar-spear held between"
655,II.,"His selle and hunter's head, and at his thigh"
656,II.,"A good, broad hanger, and one fist on high"
657,II.,"To wind the rapid echoes from his horn,"
658,II.,"That start the field birds from the sheavéd corn,"
659,II.,"Uphurled in vollies of audacious wings,"
660,II.,That cease again when it no longer sings.
661,II.,"Away, away, they flash a belted band"
662,II.,From Camelot thro' that haze-ghostly land;
663,II.,"Hounds leashed and leamers and a flash of steel,"
664,II.,A tramp of horse and the long-baying peal
665,II.,"Of stag hounds whimp'ring and--behold! the hart,"
666,II.,"A lordly height, doth from the covert dart;"
667,II.,And the big blood-hounds strain unto the chase.
668,II.,A-hunt! a-hunt! the _pryce_ seems but a pace
669,II.,"On ere 'tis wound; but now, where interlace"
670,II.,"The dense-briered underwoods, the hounds have lost"
671,II.,"The slot, there where a forest brook hath crossed"
672,II.,With intercepting waters full of leaves.
673,II.,"Beyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves"
674,II.,"Thro' dimmer boscage, and the wizard sun"
675,II.,Shapes many shadowy stags that seem to run
676,II.,Wild herds before the baffled foresters.
677,II.,"And treed aloft a reckless laugh one hears,"
678,II.,As if some helping goblin from the trees
679,II.,Mocked them the unbayed hart and made a breeze
680,II.,His pursuivant of mocking. Hastening thence
681,II.,Pursued King Arthur and King Urience
682,II.,"With one small brachet, till scarce hear could they"
683,II.,Their fellowship far-furthered course away
684,II.,On fresher trace of hind or rugged boar
685,II.,"With haggard, hairy flanks, curled tusks and hoar"
686,II.,With fierce foam-fury; and of these bereft
687,II.,The kings continued in the slot they'd left.
688,II.,And there the hart plunged gallant thro' the brake
689,II.,"Leaving a torn path shaking in his wake,"
690,II.,Down which they followed on thro' many a copse
691,II.,"Above whose brush, close on before, the tops"
692,II.,"Of the large antlers swelled anon, and so"
693,II.,Were gone where beat the brambles to and fro.
694,II.,And still they drave him hard; and ever near
695,II.,Seemed that great hart unwearied; and such cheer
696,II.,Still stung them to the chase. When Arthur's horse
697,II.,Gasped mightily and lunging in his course
698,II.,"Lay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience"
699,II.,Left his gray hunter dying near; and thence
700,II.,They held the hunt afoot; when suddenly
701,II.,"Were they aware of a wide, roughened sea,"
702,II.,And near the wood the hart upon the sward
703,II.,"Bayed, panting unto death and winded hard."
704,II.,Right so the king dispatched him and the _pryce_
705,II.,Wound on his hunting bugle clearly thrice.
706,II.,
707,II.,"As if each echo, which that wild horn's blast"
708,II.,"Waked from its sleep,--the quietude had cast"
709,II.,"Tender as mercy on it,--in a band"
710,II.,"Rose moving sounds of gladness hand in hand,"
711,II.,"Came twelve fair damsels, sunny in sovereign white,"
712,II.,From that red woodland gliding. These each knight
713,II.,"Graced with obeisance and ""Our lord,"" said one,"
714,II.,"""Tenders ye courtesy until the dawn;"
715,II.,"The Earl Sir Damas; well in his wide keep,"
716,II.,"Seen thither with due worship, ye shall sleep."""
717,II.,"And then they came o'erwearied to a hall,"
718,II.,"An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall"
719,II.,"Towered based on crags rough, windy turrets high;"
720,II.,"An old, gaunt giant-castle 'gainst a sky"
721,II.,"Wherein the moon hung foam-faced, large and full."
722,II.,"Down on dank sea-foundations broke the dull,"
723,II.,"Weird monotone of ocean, and wide rolled"
724,II.,The watery wilderness that was as old
725,II.,"As loud, defying headlands stretching out"
726,II.,Beneath still stars with a voluminous shout
727,II.,Of wreck and wrath forever. Here the two
728,II.,Were feasted fairly and with worship due
729,II.,"All errant knights, and then a damsel led"
730,II.,Each knight with flaring lamp unto his bed
731,II.,Down separate corridores of that great keep;
732,II.,And soon they rested in a heavy sleep.
733,II.,
734,II.,"And then King Arthur woke, and woke mid groans"
735,II.,Of dolorous knights; and 'round him lay the bones
736,II.,Of many woful champions mouldering;
737,II.,And he could hear the open ocean ring
738,II.,Wild wasted waves above. And so he thought
739,II.,"""It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught"
740,II.,"By that long hunt;"" and then he sought to shake"
741,II.,The horror off and to himself awake;
742,II.,"But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs,"
743,II.,And deep in iron-ribbéd cells the eyes
744,II.,"Of pale, cadaverous knights shone fixed on him"
745,II.,Unhappy; and he felt his senses swim
746,II.,"With foulness of that cell, and, ""What are ye?"
747,II.,Ghosts of chained champions or a company
748,II.,"Of phantoms, bodiless fiends? If speak ye can,"
749,II.,"Speak, in God's name! for I am here--a man!"""
750,II.,Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay
751,II.,"A dusky nightmare dying day by day,"
752,II.,Yet once of comely mien and strong withal
753,II.,"And greatly gracious; but, now hunger-tall,"
754,II.,With scrawny beard and faded hands and cheeks:
755,II.,"""Sir knight,"" said he, ""know that the wretch who speaks"
756,II.,Is but an one of twenty knights here shamed
757,II.,"Of him who lords this castle, Damas named,"
758,II.,Who mews us here for slow starvation keen;
759,II.,Around you fade the bones of some eighteen
760,II.,Tried knights of Britain; and God grant that soon
761,II.,"My hunger-lengthened ghost will see the moon,"
762,II.,"Beyond the vileness of this prisonment!"""
763,II.,With that he sighed and round the dungeon went
764,II.,"A rustling sigh, like saddened sin, and so"
765,II.,"Another dim, thin voice complained their woe:--"
766,II.,
767,II.,"""He doth enchain us with this common end,"
768,II.,That he find one who will his prowess bend
769,II.,To the attainment of his livelihood.
770,II.,"A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good"
771,II.,"And courteous, withal most noble, whom"
772,II.,"This Damas hates--yea, ever seeks his doom;"
773,II.,Denying him to their estate all right
774,II.,Save that he holds by main of arms and might.
775,II.,And thro' puissance hath he some fat fields
776,II.,"And one rich manor sumptuous, where he yields"
777,II.,Belated knights host's hospitality.
778,II.,"Then bold is Ontzlake, Damas cowardly."
779,II.,For Ontzlake would decide by sword and lance
780,II.,Body for body this inheritance;
781,II.,But Damas dotes on life so courageless;
782,II.,Thus on all knights perforce lays coward's stress
783,II.,To fight for him or starve. For ye must know
784,II.,That in his country he is hated so
785,II.,That no helm here is who will take the fight;
786,II.,"Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight."""
787,II.,Quoth he and ceased. And wondering at the tale
788,II.,"The King was thoughtful, and each faded, pale,"
789,II.,Poor countenance still conned him when he spake:
790,II.,"""And what reward if one this battle take?"""
791,II.,"""Deliverance for all if of us one"
792,II.,Consent to be his party's champion.
793,II.,But treachery and he are so close kin
794,II.,"We loathe the part as some misshapen sin,"
795,II.,And here would rather dally on to death
796,II.,"Than serving falseness save and slave our breath."""
797,II.,
798,II.,"""May God deliver you for mercy, sirs!"""
799,II.,And right anon an iron noise he hears
800,II.,"Of chains clanked loose and bars jarred rusty back,"
801,II.,The heavy gate croak open; and the black
802,II.,"Of that rank cell astonished was with light,"
803,II.,That danced fantastic with the frantic night.
804,II.,One high torch sidewise worried by the gust
805,II.,"Sunned that lorn den of hunger, death and rust,"
806,II.,"And one tall damsel vaguely vestured, fair"
807,II.,"With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair."
808,II.,"And laughing on the King, ""What cheer?"" said she;"
809,II.,"""God's life! the keep stinks vilely! and to see"
810,II.,So noble knights endungeoned hollowing here
811,II.,"Doth pain me sore with pity--but, what cheer?"""
812,II.,
813,II.,"""Thou mockest us; for me the sorriest"
814,II.,Since I was suckled; and of any quest
815,II.,To me the most imperiling and strange.--
816,II.,"But what wouldst thou?"" said Arthur. She, ""A change"
817,II.,"I offer thee, through thee to these with thee,"
818,II.,And thou but grant me in love's courtesy
819,II.,To fight for Damas and his livelihood.
820,II.,And if thou wilt not--look! thou seest this brood
821,II.,"Of lean and dwindled bellies specter-eyed,"
822,II.,"Keen knights erst who refused me?--so decide."""
823,II.,"Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze"
824,II.,That blew delirious over waves and trees;
825,II.,Thick fields of grasses and the sunny earth
826,II.,"Whose beating heat filled the red heart with mirth,"
827,II.,And made the world one sovereign pleasure house
828,II.,Where king and serf might revel and carouse;
829,II.,Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;
830,II.,Lone forest chapels by their radiant rills:
831,II.,"His palace rich at Caerlleon upon Usk,"
832,II.,And Camelot's loud halls that thro' the dusk
833,II.,Blazed far and bloomed a rose of revelry;
834,II.,Or in the misty morning shadowy
835,II.,Loomed grave for audience. And then he thought
836,II.,Of his Round Table and that Grael wide sought
837,II.,In haunted holds on demon-sinful shore;
838,II.,Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar
839,II.,With dragon heads unconquered and devour
840,II.,This realm of Britain and pluck up that flower
841,II.,Of chivalry whence ripened his renown:
842,II.,"And then the reign of some besotted crown,"
843,II.,"A bandit king of lust, idolatry--"
844,II.,And with that thought for tears he could not see:
845,II.,"Then of his greatest champions, King Ban's son,"
846,II.,"And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:"
847,II.,"And then, ah God! of his dear Guenevere,"
848,II.,And with that thought--to starve and moulder here?--
849,II.,"For, being unfriend to Arthur and his court,"
850,II.,Well wist he this grim Earl would bless that sport
851,II.,Of fortune which had fortuned him so well
852,II.,To have to starve his sovereign in a cell.--
853,II.,In the entombing rock where ground the deep;
854,II.,And all the life shut in his limbs did leap
855,II.,"Thro' eager veins and sinews fierce and red,"
856,II.,"Stung on to action, and he rose and said:"
857,II.,"""That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!"
858,II.,To rot here harder; I will fight his foe.
859,II.,"But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail,"
860,II.,"No steed against that other to avail."""
861,II.,
862,II.,"""Fear not for that; and thou shalt lack none, sire."""
863,II.,And so she led the path: her torch's fire
864,II.,Scaring wild spidery shadows at each stride
865,II.,"From cob-webbed coignes of scowling passes wide,"
866,II.,That labyrinthed the rock foundation strong
867,II.,Of that ungainly fortress bleak of wrong.
868,II.,"At length they came to a nail-studded door,"
869,II.,Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore
870,II.,Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence
871,II.,They issued on a terraced eminence.
872,II.,Beneath the sea broke sounding; and the King
873,II.,Breathed open air that had the smell and sting
874,II.,Of brine morn-vigored and blue-billowed foam;
875,II.,"For in the East the second dawning's gloam,"
876,II.,"Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks"
877,II.,Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.
878,II.,And so within that larger light of dawn
879,II.,It seemed to Arthur now that he had known
880,II.,"This maiden at his court, and so he asked."
881,II.,"But she, well-tutored, her real person masked,"
882,II.,"And answered falsely; ""Nay, deceive thee not;"
883,II.,"Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's court, I wot."
884,II.,For here it likes me best to sing and spin
885,II.,And work the hangings my sire's halls within:
886,II.,No courts or tournaments or gallants brave
887,II.,"To flatter me and love! for me--the wave,"
888,II.,"The forest, field and sky; the calm, the storm;"
889,II.,My garth wherein I walk to think; the charm
890,II.,Of uplands redolent at bounteous noon
891,II.,And full of sunlight; night's free stars and moon;
892,II.,White ships that pass some several every year;
893,II.,"These lonesome towers and those wild mews to hear."""
894,II.,"""An owlet maid!"" the King laughed. But, untrue"
895,II.,"Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,"
896,II.,Who worked vile wiles ev'n to the slaying of
897,II.,"The King, half-brother, whom she did not love."
898,II.,And presently she brought him where in state
899,II.,This swarthy Damas with mailed cowards sate....
900,II.,
901,II.,King Urience that dawning woke and found
902,II.,Himself safe couched at Camelot and wound
903,II.,In Morgane's arms; nor weened he how it was
904,II.,That this thing secretly had come to pass.
905,II.,But Accolon at Chariot sojourned still
906,II.,Content with his own dreams; for 'twas the will
907,II.,Of Morgane thus to keep him hidden here
908,II.,"For her desire's excess, where everywhere"
909,II.,"In Gore by wood and river pleasure houses,"
910,II.,"Pavilions, rose of rock for love carouses;"
911,II.,"And there in one, where 'twas her dearest wont"
912,II.,"To list a tinkling, falling water fount,--"
913,II.,Which thro' sweet talks of idle paramours
914,II.,"At sensuous ease on tumbled beds of flowers,"
915,II.,"Had caught a laughing language light thereof,"
916,II.,"And rambled ever gently whispering, ""love!""--"
917,II.,On cool white walls her hands had deftly draped
918,II.,"A dark rich hanging, where were worked and shaped"
919,II.,"Her fullest hours of pleasure flesh and mind,"
920,II.,"Imperishable passions, which could wind"
921,II.,The past and present quickly; and could mate
922,II.,"Dead loves to kisses, and intoxicate"
923,II.,With moon-soft words of past delight and song
924,II.,The heavy heart that wronged forgot the wrong.
925,II.,"And there beside it pooled the urnéd well,"
926,II.,And slipping thence thro' dripping shadows fell
927,II.,"From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,"
928,II.,"With Morgane's hollow lute, one studious dawn"
929,II.,Came solely; with not ev'n her brindled hound
930,II.,To leap beside him o'er the gleaming ground;
931,II.,"No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,"
932,II.,Or paging dwarf in purple with him there;
933,II.,"But this her lute, about which her perfume"
934,II.,"Clung odorous of memories, that made bloom"
935,II.,"Her flowing features rosy to his eyes,"
936,II.,"That saw the words, his sense could but surmise,"
937,II.,"Shaped on dim, breathing lips; the laugh that drunk"
938,II.,Her deep soul-fire from eyes wherein it sunk
939,II.,"And slowly waned away to smouldering dreams,"
940,II.,"Fathomless with thought, far in their dove-gray gleams."
941,II.,"And so for those most serious eyes and lips,"
942,II.,"Faint, filmy features, all the music slips"
943,II.,Of buoyant being bubbling to his voice
944,II.,To chant her praises; and with nervous poise
945,II.,"His fleet, trained fingers call from her long lute"
946,II.,Such riotous notes as must make madly mute
947,II.,The nightingale that listens quivering.
948,II.,And well he knows that winging hence it'll sing
949,II.,"These aching notes, whose beauties burn and pain"
950,II.,"Its anguished heart now sobless, not in vain"
951,II.,Wild 'neath her casement in that garden old
952,II.,Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold
953,II.,Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon;
954,II.,"And if it dies, the heartache of the tune"
955,II.,"Shall clamor stormy passion at her ear,"
956,II.,Of death more dear than life if love be there;
957,II.,"Melt her quick eyes to tears, her throat to sobs"
958,II.,"Tumultuous heaved, while separation throbs"
959,II.,"Hard at her heart, and longing rears to Death"
960,II.,"Two prayerful eyes of pleading ""for one breath--"
961,II.,An ardor of fierce life--crushed in his arms
962,II.,"Close, close! and, oh, for such, all these smooth charms,"
963,II.,"Full, sentient charms voluptuous evermore!"""
964,II.,And sweet to know these sensitive vows shall soar
965,II.,Ev'n to the dull ear of her drowsy lord
966,II.,Beside her; heart-defying with each word
967,II.,Harped in the bird's voice rhythmically clear.
968,II.,And thus he sang to her who was not there:
969,II.,
970,II.,"""She comes! her presence, like a moving song"
971,II.,"Breathed soft of loveliest lips and lute-like tongue,"
972,II.,Sways all the gurgling forests from their rest:
973,II.,"I fancy where her rustling foot is pressed,"
974,II.,"So faltering, love seems timid, but how strong"
975,II.,That darling love that flutters in her breast!
976,II.,
977,II.,"""She comes! and the green vistas are stormed thro'--"
978,II.,"As if wild wings, wet-varnished with dripped dew,"
979,II.,"Had dashed a sudden sunbeam tempest past,"
980,II.,--With her eyes' inspiration clearly chaste;
981,II.,"A rhythmic lavishment of bright gray blue,"
982,II.,Long arrows of her eyes perfection cast.
983,II.,
984,II.,"""Ah, God! she comes! and, Love, I feel thy breath,"
985,II.,Like the soft South who idly wandereth
986,II.,"Thro' musical leaves of laughing laziness,"
987,II.,"Page on before her, how sweet--none can guess!"
988,II.,To say my soul 'Here's harmony dear as death
989,II.,"To sigh wild vows, or utterless, to bless.'"
990,II.,
991,II.,"""She comes! ah, God! and all my brain is brave"
992,II.,To war for words to laud her and to lave
993,II.,Her queenly beauty in such vows whereof
994,II.,May hush melodious cooings of a dove:
995,II.,For her light feet the favored path to pave
996,II.,"With oaths, like roses, raving mad with love."
997,II.,
998,II.,"""She comes! in me a passion--as the moon"
999,II.,Works madness in strong men--my blood doth swoon
1000,II.,Towards her glory; and I feel her soul
1001,II.,Cling lip to lip with mine; and now the whole
1002,II.,"Mix with me, aching like a tender tune"
1003,II.,Exhausted; lavished in a god's control.
1004,II.,
1005,II.,"""She comes! ah, Christ! ye eager stars that grace"
1006,II.,"The fragmentary skies, that dimple space,"
1007,II.,"Clink, and I hear her harp-sweet footfalls come:"
1008,II.,"Ah, wood-indulging, violet-vague perfume,"
1009,II.,"Art of her presence, of her wild-flower face,"
1010,II.,That like some gracious blossom stains the gloom?
1011,II.,
1012,II.,"""Oh, living exultation of the blood!"
1013,II.,"That now--as sunbursts, the almighty mood"
1014,II.,"Of some moved god, scatter the storm that roars,"
1015,II.,And hush--her love like some spent splendor pours
1016,II.,"Into it all immaculate maidenhood,"
1017,II.,And all the heart that hesitates--adores.
1018,II.,
1019,II.,"""Vanquished! so vanquished!--ah, triumphant sweet!"
1020,II.,The height of heaven--supine at thy feet!
1021,II.,"Where love feasts crowned, and basks in such a glare"
1022,II.,"As hearts of suns burn, in thine eyes and hair,"
1023,II.,Unutterable with raveled fires that cheat
1024,II.,The ardent clay of me and make me air.
1025,II.,
1026,II.,"""And so, rare witch, thy blood, like some lewd wine,"
1027,II.,"Shall subtly make me, like thee, half divine;"
1028,II.,"And,--sweet rebellion!--clasp thee till thou urge"
1029,II.,To combat close of savage kisses: surge
1030,II.,"A war that rubies all thy proud cheeks' shine,--"
1031,II.,"Slain, struggling blushes,--till white truce emerge."
1032,II.,
1033,II.,"""My life for thine, thus bartered lip to lip!"
1034,II.,"A striving being pulsant, that shall slip"
1035,II.,Like song and flame in sense from thee to me;
1036,II.,"Nor held, but quick rebartered thence to thee:"
1037,II.,"So our two loves be as a singleship,"
1038,II.,"Ten thousand loves as one eternally."""
1039,II.,
1040,II.,Babbled the woodland like a rocky brook;
1041,II.,"And as the ecstacy of foliage shook,"
1042,II.,"Hot pieces of bright, sunny heavens glanced"
1043,II.,Like polished silver thro' pale leaves that danced.
1044,II.,"As one hath seen some green-gowned huntress fair,"
1045,II.,"Morn in her cheeks and midnight in her hair,"
1046,II.,Eyes clear as hollow dews; clean limbs as lithe
1047,II.,As limbs swift morning moves; a voice as blithe
1048,II.,As high hawk's ringing thro' the falling dews;
1049,II.,"Pant thro' the bramble-matted avenues,--"
1050,II.,"Where brier and thorn have gashed her gown's pinched green,"
1051,II.,"About bright breasts and arms, the milky sheen"
1052,II.,"Of white skin healthy pouting out; her face,"
1053,II.,"Ardent and flushed, fixed on the lordly chase."
1054,II.,
1055,II.,
1056,III.,III.
1057,III.,
1058,III.,The eve now came; and shadows cowled the way
1059,III.,"Like somber palmers, who have kneeled to pray"
1060,III.,"Beside a wayside shrine, and rosy rolled"
1061,III.,"Up the capacious West a grainy gold,"
1062,III.,"Luxuriant fluid, burned thro' strong, keen skies,"
1063,III.,Which seemed as towering gates of Paradise
1064,III.,"Surged dim, far glories on the hungry gaze."
1065,III.,"And from that sunset down the roseate ways,"
1066,III.,"To Accolon, who with his idle lute,"
1067,III.,Reclined in revery against a root
1068,III.,"Of a great oak, a fragment of that West,"
1069,III.,"A dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed,"
1070,III.,Skipped like a leaf the rather frosts have burned
1071,III.,"And cozened to a fever red, that turned"
1072,III.,And withered all its sap. And this one came
1073,III.,"From Camelot; from his beloved dame,"
1074,III.,Morgane the Fay. He on his shoulder bore
1075,III.,"A burning blade wrought strange with wizard lore,"
1076,III.,Runed mystically; and a scabbard which
1077,III.,"Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich."
1078,III.,"He, louting to the knight, ""Sir knight,"" said he,"
1079,III.,"""Your lady with all sweetest courtesy"
1080,III.,"Assures you--ah, unworthy messenger"
1081,III.,"I of such brightness!--of that love of her."""
1082,III.,"Then doffing that great baldric, with the sword"
1083,III.,"To him he gave: ""And this from him, my lord"
1084,III.,"King Arthur; even his Excalibur,"
1085,III.,"The sovereign blade, which Merlin gat of her,"
1086,III.,"The Ladye of the Lake, who Launcelot"
1087,III.,"Fostered from infanthood, as well you wot,"
1088,III.,In some wierd mere in Briogn's tangled lands
1089,III.,Of charms and mist; where filmy fairy bands
1090,III.,By lazy moons of Autumn spin their fill
1091,III.,Of giddy morrice on the frosty hill.
1092,III.,By goodness of her favor this is sent;
1093,III.,Who craved King Arthur boon with this intent:
1094,III.,That soon for her a desperate combat one
1095,III.,With one of mightier prowess were begun;
1096,III.,And with the sword Excalibur right sure
1097,III.,Were she against that champion to endure.
1098,III.,"The blade flame-trenchant, but more prize the sheath"
1099,III.,"Which stauncheth blood and guardeth from all death."""
1100,III.,"He said: and Accolon looked on the sword,"
1101,III.,"A mystic falchion, and, ""It shall wend hard"
1102,III.,"With him thro' thee, unconquerable blade,"
1103,III.,"Whoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid"
1104,III.,Stress of unworship: and the hours as slow
1105,III.,As palsied hours in Purgatory go
1106,III.,"For those unmassed, till I have slain this foe!"
1107,III.,"My purse, sweet page; and now--to her who gave,"
1108,III.,"Dispatch! and this:--to all commands--her slave,"
1109,III.,To death obedient. In love or war
1110,III.,Her love to make me all the warrior.
1111,III.,Plead her grace mercy for so long delay
1112,III.,From love that dies an hourly death each day
1113,III.,"Till her white hands kissed he shall kiss her face,"
1114,III.,"By which his life breathes in continual grace."""
1115,III.,Thus he commanded; and incontinent
1116,III.,The dwarf departed like a red ray sent
1117,III.,From rich down-flowering clouds of suffused light
1118,III.,"Winged o'er long, purple glooms; and with the night,"
1119,III.,Whose votaress cypress stoled the dying strife
1120,III.,"Softly of day, and for whose perished life"
1121,III.,"Gave heaven her golden stars, in dreamy thought"
1122,III.,Wends Accolon to hazy Chariot.
1123,III.,
1124,III.,"And it befell him; wandering one dawn,"
1125,III.,"As was his wont, across a dew-drenched lawn,"
1126,III.,Glad with night freshness and elastic health
1127,III.,In sky and earth that lavished worlds of wealth
1128,III.,"From heady breeze and racy smells, a knight"
1129,III.,"And lofty lady met he; gay bedight,"
1130,III.,With following of six esquires; and they
1131,III.,"Held on straight wrists the jess'd gerfalcon gray,"
1132,III.,And rode a-hawking o'er the leas of Gore
1133,III.,"From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore"
1134,III.,"Hurt in the lists, a spear thrust in his thigh:"
1135,III.,Who had besought--for much he feared to die--
1136,III.,"This knight and his fair lady, as they rode"
1137,III.,"To hawk near Chariot, the Queen's abode,"
1138,III.,That they would pray her in all charity
1139,III.,"Fare post to him,--for in chirurgery"
1140,III.,"Of all that land she was the greatest leach,--"
1141,III.,And her to his recovery beseech.
1142,III.,"So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,"
1143,III.,"And spake their message,--for right over fain"
1144,III.,"Were they toward their sport,--that he might bare"
1145,III.,"Petition to that lady. But, not there"
1146,III.,"Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;"
1147,III.,"But now a se'nnight lay at Camelot,"
1148,III.,Of Guenevere the guest; and there with her
1149,III.,Four other queens of farther Britain were:
1150,III.,"Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,"
1151,III.,King Mark's wife; who right rarely then was seen
1152,III.,"At court for jealousy of Mark, who knew"
1153,III.,Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true
1154,III.,Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while
1155,III.,How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:
1156,III.,She of Northgales and she of Eastland: and
1157,III.,She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band
1158,III.,For sovereignty and love and loveliness
1159,III.,Was not in any realm to grace and bless.
1160,III.,"Then quoth the knight, ""Ay? see how fortune turns"
1161,III.,"And varies like an April day, that burns"
1162,III.,"Now welkins blue with calm, now scowls them down,"
1163,III.,"Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown."
1164,III.,"For, look, this Damas, who so long hath lain"
1165,III.,"A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,"
1166,III.,"Dark in his bandit towers by the deep,"
1167,III.,Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep;
1168,III.,So sends dispatch a courier to my lord
1169,III.,"With, 'Lo! behold! to-morrow with the sword"
1170,III.,Earl Damas by his knight at point of lance
1171,III.,"Decides the issue of inheritance,"
1172,III.,"Body to body, or by champion.'"
1173,III.,Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.
1174,III.,"Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, and he could,"
1175,III.,Right fain were he to save his livelihood.
1176,III.,"Then mused Sir Accolon: ""The adventure goes"
1177,III.,Ev'n as my Lady fashioneth; who knows
1178,III.,"But what her arts develop this and make?"""
1179,III.,"And thus to those: ""His battle I will take,--"
1180,III.,"And he be so conditioned, harried of"
1181,III.,"Estate and life,--in knighthood and for love."
1182,III.,"Conduct me thither."""
1183,III.,"And, gramercied, then"
1184,III.,"Mounted a void horse of that wondering train,"
1185,III.,And thence departed with two squires. And they
1186,III.,"Came to a lone, dismantled priory"
1187,III.,"Hard by a castle gray on whose square towers,"
1188,III.,"Machicolated, o'er the forest's bowers,"
1189,III.,The immemorial morning bloomed and blushed.
1190,III.,"A woodland manor olden, dark embushed"
1191,III.,In wild and woody hills. And then one wound
1192,III.,"An echoy horn, and with the boundless sound"
1193,III.,"The drawbridge rumbled moatward clanking, and"
1194,III.,Into a paved court passed that little band....
1195,III.,
1196,III.,"When all the world was morning, gleam and glare"
1197,III.,"Of far deluging glory, and the air"
1198,III.,"Sang with the wood-bird, like a humming lyre"
1199,III.,Swept bold of minstrel fingers wire on wire;
1200,III.,Ere that fixed hour of prime came Arthur armed
1201,III.,For battle royally. A black steed warmed
1202,III.,"A fierce impatience 'neath him cased in mail,"
1203,III.,"Huge, foreign; and accoutered head to tail"
1204,III.,"In costly sendal; rearward wine-dark red,"
1205,III.,Amber as sunlight to his fretful head.
1206,III.,"Firm, heavy armor blue had Arthur on"
1207,III.,"Beneath a robe of honor, like the dawn,"
1208,III.,Satin and diapered and purflewed deep
1209,III.,With lordly golden purple; whence did sweep
1210,III.,"Two hanging acorn tuftings of fine gold,"
1211,III.,"And at his thigh a falchion, long and bold,"
1212,III.,"Heavy and triple-edged; its scabbard, red"
1213,III.,Cordovan leather; thence a baldric led
1214,III.,"Of new cut deer-skin; this laborious wrought,"
1215,III.,"And curiously with slides of gold was fraught,"
1216,III.,"And buckled with a buckle white that shone,"
1217,III.,"Bone of the sea-horse, tongued with jet-black bone."
1218,III.,"And, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold"
1219,III.,"Barbaric, wyvern-crested whose throat rolled"
1220,III.,"A flame-sharp tongue of agate, and whose eyes"
1221,III.,Glowed venomous great rubies fierce of prize.
1222,III.,"And in his hand, a wiry lance of ash,"
1223,III.,"Lattened with finest silver, like a flash"
1224,III.,Of sunlight in the morning shone a-gash.
1225,III.,Clad was his squire most richly; he whose head
1226,III.,Curled with close locks of yellow tinged to red:
1227,III.,"Of noble bearing; fair face; hawk eyes keen,"
1228,III.,"And youthful, bearded chin. Right well beseen,"
1229,III.,Scarfed with blue satin; on his shoulder strong
1230,III.,"One broad gold brooch chased strangely, thick and long."
1231,III.,"His legs in hose of rarest Totness clad,"
1232,III.,And parti-colored leathern shoes he had
1233,III.,Gold-latched; and in his hand a bannered spear
1234,III.,Speckled and bronzen sharpened in the air.
1235,III.,
1236,III.,"So with his following, while lay like scars"
1237,III.,"The blue mist thin along the woodland bars,"
1238,III.,"Thro' dew and fog, thro' shadow and thro' ray"
1239,III.,Joustward Earl Damas led the forest way.
1240,III.,Then to King Arthur when arrived were these
1241,III.,"To where the lists shone silken thro' the trees,"
1242,III.,"Bannered and draped, a wimpled damsel came,"
1243,III.,"Secret, upon a palfrey all aflame"
1244,III.,"With sweat and heat of hurry, and, ""From her,"
1245,III.,"Your sister Morgane, your Excalibur,"
1246,III.,With tender greeting: For ye well have need
1247,III.,"In this adventure of him. So, God speed!"""
1248,III.,And so departed suddenly: nor knew
1249,III.,The king but this his weapon tried and true.
1250,III.,"But brittle this and fashioned like thereof,"
1251,III.,"And false of baser metal, in unlove"
1252,III.,"And treason to his life, of her of kin"
1253,III.,"Half sister, Morgane--an unnatural sin."
1254,III.,
1255,III.,Then heralded into the lists he rode.
1256,III.,"Opposed flashed Accolon, who light bestrode,"
1257,III.,"Exultant, proud in talisman of that sword,"
1258,III.,"A dun horse lofty as a haughty lord,"
1259,III.,"Pure white about each hollow, pasterned hoof."
1260,III.,"Equipped shone knight and steed in arms of proof,"
1261,III.,Dappled with yellow variegated plate
1262,III.,Of Spanish laton. And of sovereign state
1263,III.,His surcoat robe of honor white and black
1264,III.,"Of satin, red-silk needled front and back"
1265,III.,Then blackly bordered. And above his robe
1266,III.,"That two-edged sword,--a throbbing golden globe"
1267,III.,"Of vicious jewels,--thrust its burning hilt,"
1268,III.,"Its broad belt, tawny and with gold-work gilt,"
1269,III.,Clasped with the eyelid of a black sea-horse
1270,III.,Whose tongue was rosy gold. And stern as Force
1271,III.,"His visored helmet burned like fire, of rich"
1272,III.,And bronzen laton hammered; and on which
1273,III.,"An hundred crystals glittered, thick as on"
1274,III.,A silver web bright-studding dews of dawn.
1275,III.,"The casque's tail crest a taloned griffin ramped,"
1276,III.,In whose horned brow one virtuous jewel stamped.
1277,III.,"An ashen spear round-shafted, overlaid"
1278,III.,"With fine blue silver, whereon colors played,"
1279,III.,Firm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed.
1280,III.,
1281,III.,Intense on either side an instant stood
1282,III.,"Glittering as serpents which, with Spring renewed,"
1283,III.,"In glassy scales meet on some greening way,"
1284,III.,"Angry advance, quick tongues at poisonous play."
1285,III.,"Then clanged a herald's clarion and sharp heels,"
1286,III.,"Harsh-spurred, each champion's springing courser feels"
1287,III.,Touch to red onset; the aventured spears
1288,III.,Hurled like two sun-bursts of a storm when clears
1289,III.,Laborious thunders; and in middle course
1290,III.,Shrieked shrill the unpierced shields; mailed horse from horse
1291,III.,Lashed madly pawing--and a hoarse roar rang
1292,III.,"From buckram lists, till the wild echoes sang"
1293,III.,Of leagues on leagues of forest and of cliff.
1294,III.,Rigid the proof-shelled warriors passed and stiff
1295,III.,Whither their squires fresher spears upheld;
1296,III.,Nor stayed to breathe; but scarcely firmly selled
1297,III.,Launched deadly forward. Shield to savage shield
1298,III.,"Opposing; crest to crest, whose fronts did wield"
1299,III.,A towering war's unmercifulest scath;
1300,III.,"Rocking undaunted, glared wan withering wrath"
1301,III.,"From balls of jeweled eyes, and raging stood"
1302,III.,"Slim, slippery bodies, in the sun like blood."
1303,III.,"The lance of Accolon, as on a rock"
1304,III.,"Long storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,"
1305,III.,On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;
1306,III.,"But him resistless Arthur's,--high from horse"
1307,III.,"Sell-lifted,--ruinous bare crashing on"
1308,III.,A long sword's length; unsaddled Accolon
1309,III.,"For one stunned moment lay. Then rising, drew"
1310,III.,"The great sword at his hip, that shone like dew"
1311,III.,"Fresh flashed in morn. ""Descend;"" he stiffly said,"
1312,III.,"""To proof of better weapons head for head!"
1313,III.,"Enough of spears, to swords!"" and so the knight"
1314,III.,"Addressed him to the King. Dismounting light,"
1315,III.,"Arthur his moon-bright brand unsheathed, and high"
1316,III.,"Each covering shield gleamed slanting to the sky,"
1317,III.,"Relentless, strong, and stubborn; underneath"
1318,III.,Their wary shelters foined the glittering death
1319,III.,Of stolid steel thrust livid arm to arm:
1320,III.,As cloud to cloud growls up a soaring storm
1321,III.,Above the bleak wood and lithe lightnings work
1322,III.,"Brave blades wild warring, in the black that lurk,"
1323,III.,"Thus fenced and thrust--one tortoise shield descends,"
1324,III.,"Leaps a fierce sword shrill,--like a flame which sends"
1325,III.,"A long fang heavenward,--for a crushing stroke;"
1326,III.,"Swings hard and trenchant, and, resounding heard,"
1327,III.,Sings surly helmward full; defiance reared
1328,III.,Soars to a brother blow to shriek again
1329,III.,"Blade on brave blade. And o'er the battered plain,"
1330,III.,"Forward and backward, blade on baleful blade,"
1331,III.,Teeth clenched as visors where the fierce eyes made
1332,III.,"A cavernous, smouldering fury, shield at shield,"
1333,III.,Unflinchingly remained and scorned to yield.
1334,III.,
1335,III.,So Arthur drew aside to rest upon
1336,III.,His falchion for a pause; but Accolon
1337,III.,"As yet, thro' virtue of that magic sheath"
1338,III.,"Fresh and almighty, being no nearer death"
1339,III.,"Thro' loss of blood than when the trial begun,"
1340,III.,"Chafed with delay. But Arthur with the sun,"
1341,III.,"Its thirsty heat, the loss from wounds of blood,"
1342,III.,Leaned fainting weary and so resting stood.
1343,III.,"Cried Accolon, ""Here is no time for rest!"
1344,III.,"Defend thee!"" and straight on the monarch pressed;"
1345,III.,"""Defend or yield thee as one recreant!"""
1346,III.,"Full on his helm a hewing blow did plant,"
1347,III.,Which beat a flying fire from the steel;
1348,III.,"Smote, like one drunk with wine, the King did reel,"
1349,III.,"Breath, brain bewildered. Then, infuriate,"
1350,III.,"Nerve-stung with vigor by that blow, in hate"
1351,III.,"Gnarled all his strength into one stroke of might,"
1352,III.,"And in both fists the huge blade knotted tight,"
1353,III.,"Swung red, terrific to a sundering stroke.--"
1354,III.,"As some bright wind that hurls th' uprooted oak,--"
1355,III.,Boomed full the beaten burgonet he wore:
1356,III.,"Hacked thro' and thro' the crest, and cleanly shore"
1357,III.,The golden boasting of its griffin fierce
1358,III.,With hollow clamor down astounded ears:
1359,III.,"No further thence--but, shattered to the grass,"
1360,III.,"That brittle blade, crushed as if made of glass,"
1361,III.,Into hot pieces like a broken ray
1362,III.,Burst sunward and in feverish fragments lay.
1363,III.,Then groaned the King unarmed; and so he knew
1364,III.,This no Excalibur; that tried and true
1365,III.,"Most perfect tempered, runed and mystical."
1366,III.,"Sobbed, ""_Oh, hell-false! betray me?_""-- Then withal"
1367,III.,"Him seemed this foe, who fought with so much stress,"
1368,III.,"So long untiring, and with no distress"
1369,III.,"Of wounds or heat, through treachery bare his brand;"
1370,III.,And then he knew it by its hilt that hand
1371,III.,Clutched to an avenging stroke. For Accolon
1372,III.,In madness urged the belted battle on
1373,III.,"His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross"
1374,III.,"Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss"
1375,III.,Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around
1376,III.,"Crawled the unequal conflict o'er the ground,"
1377,III.,Sharded with shattered spears and off-hewn bits
1378,III.,Of shivered steel and gold that burnt in fits.
1379,III.,"So hunted, yet defiant, cowering"
1380,III.,"Beneath his bossy shield's defense, the King"
1381,III.,"Persisted stoutly. And, devising still"
1382,III.,"How to secure his sword and by what skill,"
1383,III.,Him so it fortuned when most desperate:
1384,III.,In that hot chase they came where shattered late
1385,III.,"Lay tossed the truncheon of a bursten lance,"
1386,III.,"Which deftly seized, to Accolon's advance"
1387,III.,He wielded valorous. Against the fist
1388,III.,"Smote where the gauntlet husked the nervous wrist,"
1389,III.,Which strained the weapon to a wrathful blow;
1390,III.,"Palsied, the tightened sinews of his foe"
1391,III.,"Loosened from effort, and, the falchion seized,"
1392,III.,"Easy was yielded. Then the wroth King squeezed,"
1393,III.,"--Hurling the moon-disk of his shield afar,--"
1394,III.,"Him in both knotted arms of wiry war,"
1395,III.,"Rocked sidewise twice or thrice,--as one hath seen"
1396,III.,"Some stern storm take an ash tree, roaring green,"
1397,III.,Nodding its sappy bulk of trunk and boughs
1398,III.,"To dizziness, from tough, coiled roots carouse"
1399,III.,Its long height thundering;--so King Arthur shook
1400,III.,"Sir Accolon and headlong flung; then took,"
1401,III.,"Tearing away, that scabbard from his side,"
1402,III.,"Tossed thro' the breathless lists, that far and wide"
1403,III.,Gulped in the battle voiceless. Then right wroth
1404,III.,"Secured Excalibur, and grasped of both"
1405,III.,Wild hands swung glittering and brought bitter down
1406,III.,"On rising Accolon; steel, bone and brawn"
1407,III.,Hewed thro' that blow; unsettled every sense:
1408,III.,Bathed in a world of blood his limbs grew tense
1409,III.,And writhen then ungathered limp with death.
1410,III.,"Bent to him Arthur, from the brow beneath,"
1411,III.,"Unlaced the helm and doffed it and so asked,"
1412,III.,"When the fair forehead's hair curled dark uncasqued,"
1413,III.,"""Say! ere I slay thee, whence and what thou art?"
1414,III.,"What King, what court be thine? and from what part,"
1415,III.,"Speak! or thou diest!--Yet, that brow, methinks"
1416,III.,"I have beheld it--where? say, ere death drinks"
1417,III.,"The soul-light from life's cups, thine eyes! thou art--"
1418,III.,"What art thou, speak!"""
1419,III.,He answered slow and short
1420,III.,"With tortured breathing: ""I?--one, Accolon"
1421,III.,"Of Gaul, a knight of Arthur's court--at dawn--"
1422,III.,"God wot what now I am for love so slain!"""
1423,III.,"Then seemed the victor spasmed with keen pain,"
1424,III.,Covered with mailéd hands his visored face;
1425,III.,"""Thou Accolon? art Accolon?"" a space"
1426,III.,"Exclaimed and conned him: then asked softly, ""Say,"
1427,III.,"Whence gatest thou this sword, or in what way"
1428,III.,"Thou hadst it, speak?"" But wandering that knight"
1429,III.,"Heard dully, senses clodded thick with night;"
1430,III.,"Then rallying earthward: ""Woe, woe worth the sword!"
1431,III.,"--From love of love who lives, for love yet lord!--"
1432,III.,Morgane!--thy love for love in love hadst made
1433,III.,Me strong o'er kings an hundred! to have swayed
1434,III.,"Britain! had this not risen like a fate,"
1435,III.,"Spawned up, a Hell's miscarriage sired of Hate!--"
1436,III.,"A king? thou curse! a gold and blood crowned king,"
1437,III.,With Arthur's sister queen?--'Twas she who schemed.
1438,III.,And there at Chariot we loved and dreamed
1439,III.,Gone some twelve months. There so we had devolved
1440,III.,How Arthur's death were compassed and resolved
1441,III.,"Each liberal morning, like an almoner,"
1442,III.,Prodigal of silver to the begging air;
1443,III.,Each turbulent eve that in heaven's turquoise rolled
1444,III.,Convulsive fiery glories deep in gold;
1445,III.,Each night--hilarious heavens vast of night!--
1446,III.,Boisterous with quivering stars buoyed bubble-light
1447,III.,In flexuous labyrinths o' the intricate sphere.
1448,III.,We dreamed and spake Ambition at our ear--
1449,III.,"Nay! a crowned curse and crimeful clad she came,"
1450,III.,"To me, that woman, brighter than a flame;"
1451,III.,And laughed on me with pouting lips up-pursed
1452,III.,For kisses which I gave for love: How cursed
1453,III.,"Was I thereafter! For, lie fleshed in truth,"
1454,III.,She shrivels to a hag! Behind that youth
1455,III.,"Ugly, misshapen; Lust not Love, wherein"
1456,III.,Germs pregnant seed of Hell for hate and sin.--
1457,III.,"_I_ seek for such the proudest height of seat,"
1458,III.,"King Arthur's kingdom, and bold fame complete?--"
1459,III.,Harlot!--sweet spouse of Urience King of Gore!--
1460,III.,Sweet harlot!--here's that death determined o'er!
1461,III.,"And now thou hast thy dream, and dreaming grieve"
1462,III.,That death so ruins it?--Thy mouth to shrieve!--
1463,III.,"Nay, nay, I love thee! witness bare this field!"
1464,III.,"I love thee!--heart, dost love her and yet yield?--"
1465,III.,"Enow! enow! so hale me hence to die!"""
1466,III.,
1467,III.,Then anger in the good King's gloomy eye
1468,III.,"Burnt, instant-embered, as one oft may see"
1469,III.,A star leak out of heaven and cease to be.
1470,III.,"Slow from his visage he his visor raised,"
1471,III.,"And on the dying one mute moment gazed,"
1472,III.,"Then low bespake him grimly: ""Accolon,"
1473,III.,"I am that King."" He with an awful groan,"
1474,III.,"Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;"
1475,III.,Strained to his tottering knees and haggard drew
1476,III.,"Up full his armored tallness, hoarsely cried,"
1477,III.,"""The King!"" and at his mailed feet clashed and died."
1478,III.,Then rose a world of anxious faces pressed
1479,III.,"About King Arthur, who, though wound-distressed,"
1480,III.,"Bespake that multitude: ""Whiles breath and power"
1481,III.,"Remain, judge we these brethren: This harsh hour"
1482,III.,Hath yielded Damas all this rich estate;--
1483,III.,So it is his--allotted his of Fate
1484,III.,Thro' might of arms; so let it be to him.
1485,III.,"For, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim"
1486,III.,But that it hath this strong conclusion:
1487,III.,This much by us as errant knight is done:
1488,III.,"Now our decree as King of Britain, hear:"
1489,III.,"We do adjudge this Damas banned fore'er,"
1490,III.,Outlawed and exiled from all shores and isles
1491,III.,Of farthest Britain in its many miles.
1492,III.,One month be his--no more! then will we come
1493,III.,Even with an iron host to seal his doom;
1494,III.,"If he be not departed over seas,"
1495,III.,Hang naked from his battlements to please
1496,III.,Of carrion ravens and wild hawks the craws.
1497,III.,Thus much for Damas. But our pleasure draws
1498,III.,"Toward sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King"
1499,III.,To take into his knightly following
1500,III.,Of that Round Table royal.--Stand our word!--
1501,III.,But I am overweary; take my sword;--
1502,III.,"Unharness me; for, battle worn, I tire"
1503,III.,With bruises' achings and wounds mad with fire;
1504,III.,"And monasteryward would I right fain,"
1505,III.,"Even Glastonbury and with me the slain."""
1506,III.,"So bare they then the wounded King away,"
1507,III.,"The dead behind. So, closed the Autumn day."
1508,III.,
1509,III.,*       *       *       *       *
1510,III.,
1511,III.,"But when within that abbey he waxed strong,"
1512,III.,The King remembering him of all the wrong
1513,III.,"That Damas had inflicted on the land,"
1514,III.,Commanded Lionell with a staunch band
1515,III.,This weed's out-stamping if still rooted there.
1516,III.,"He riding thither to that robber lair,"
1517,III.,"Led Arthur's hopefulest helms, when thorn on thorn"
1518,III.,Reddened an hundred spears one winter morn;
1519,III.,"Built up, a bulk of bastioned rock on rock,"
1520,III.,"Vast battlements, that loomed above the shock"
1521,III.,"Of freshening foam that climbed with haling hands,"
1522,III.,Lone cloudy-clustered turrets in loud lands
1523,III.,"Set desolate,--mournful o'er wide, frozen flats,--"
1524,III.,Found hollow towers the haunt of owls and bats.

1529,IV.,"Hate, born of Wrath and mother red of Crime,"

1531,IV.,"Artificer of God, had coined one world"
1532,IV.,From formless forms of void and 'round it furled
1533,IV.,"Its lordly raiment of the day and night,"
1534,IV.,And germed its womb for seasons throed with might:
1535,IV.,"And Hell sent Hate to man to hate or use,"
1536,IV.,To serve itself by serving and amuse....
1537,IV.,
1538,IV.,For her half brother Morgane had conceived
1539,IV.,"A morbid hatred; in that much she grieved,"
1540,IV.,"Envious and jealous, for that high renown"
1541,IV.,And majesty the King for his fast crown
1542,IV.,"Thro' worship had acquired. And once he said,"
1543,IV.,"""The closest kin to state are those to dread:"
1544,IV.,No honor such to crush: envenoming

1546,IV.,"Petition to the soul, while conscience quakes"
1547,IV.,"Huddled, but stern to hearts whose cold pride takes."""
1548,IV.,And well she knew that Arthur: mightier
1549,IV.,"Than Accolon, without Excalibur"
1550,IV.,Were as a stingless hornet in the joust
1551,IV.,With all his foreign weapons. So her trust
1552,IV.,Smiled certain of conclusion; eloquent
1553,IV.,Gave lofty heart bold hope that at large eyes
1554,IV.,Piled up imperial dreams of power and prize.
1555,IV.,"And in her carven chamber, oaken dark,"
1556,IV.,"Traceried and arrased, o'er the barren park"

1563,IV.,"""And he removed?--fond fool! _he is removed!_"
1564,IV.,Death-dull from feet to hair and graveward shoved

1612,IV.,Thus she conspired with her that rainy night
1613,IV.,"Lone in her chamber; when no haggard, white,"
1614,IV.,"Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane,"
1615,IV.,"But on the leads beat an incessant rain,"
1616,IV.,And sighed and moaned a weary wind along
1617,IV.,The turrets and torn poplars stirred to song.
1618,IV.,
1619,IV.,So grew her face severe as skies that take
1620,IV.,"Dark forces of full storm, sound-shod, that shake"
1621,IV.,"With murmurous feet black hills, and stab with fire"
1622,IV.,A pine some moaning forest mourns as sire.
1623,IV.,So touched her countenance that dark intent;
1624,IV.,"And to still eyes stern thoughts a passion sent,"
1625,IV.,As midnight waters luminous glass deep
1626,IV.,"Suggestive worlds of austere stars in sleep,"
1627,IV.,Vague ghostly gray locked in their hollow gloom.
1628,IV.,"Then as if some vast wind had swept the room,"
1629,IV.,"Silent, intense, had raised her from her seat,"
1630,IV.,"Of dim, great arms had made her a retreat,"
1631,IV.,"Secret as love to move in, like some ghost,"
1632,IV.,"Noiseless as death and subtle as sharp frost,"
1633,IV.,"Poised like a light and borne as carefully,"
1634,IV.,Trod she the gusty hall where shadowy
1635,IV.,The stirring hangings rolled a Pagan war.
1636,IV.,"And there the mail of Urience shone. A star,"
1637,IV.,"Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped"
1638,IV.,From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped
1639,IV.,"And took the sword bright, burnished by his page,"
1640,IV.,And ruddy as a flame with restless rage.
1641,IV.,Grasping this death unto the chamber where
1642,IV.,Slept innocent her spouse she moved--an air
1643,IV.,"Twined in soft, glossy sendal; or a fit"
1644,IV.,"Of faery song a wicked charm in it,"
1645,IV.,A spell that sings seductive on to death.
1646,IV.,Then paused she at one chamber; for a breath
1647,IV.,"Listened: and here her son Sir Ewain slept,"
1648,IV.,"He who of ravens a black army kept,"
1649,IV.,"In war than fiercest men more terrible,"
1650,IV.,That tore forth eyes of kings who blinded fell.
1651,IV.,"Sure that he slept, to Urience stole and stood"
1652,IV.,Dim by his couch. About her heart hot blood
1653,IV.,"Caught strangling, then throbbed thudding fever up"
1654,IV.,"To her broad eyes, like wine whirled in a cup."
1655,IV.,
1656,IV.,"Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth"
1657,IV.,Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South
1658,IV.,Trickling thro' perplexed ripples of low leaves;
1659,IV.,To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves
1660,IV.,Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet;--
1661,IV.,"Feet sandaled with crushed, sifted snows and fleet"
1662,IV.,To come and go and airy anxiously.
1663,IV.,"She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee"
1664,IV.,Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk
1665,IV.,"Dripping a downy language in the dusk,"
1666,IV.,Laid lips to ears and luted memories of
1667,IV.,"Now hateful Urience:--Her maiden love,"
1668,IV.,That willing went from Caerlleon to Gore
1669,IV.,"One dazzling day of Autumn. How a boar,"
1670,IV.,"Wild as the wonder of the blazing wood,"
1671,IV.,"Raged at her from a cavernous solitude,"
1672,IV.,"Which, crimson-creepered, yawned the bristling curse"
1673,IV.,Murderous upon her; how her steed waxed worse
1674,IV.,"And, snorting terror, fled unmanageable,"
1675,IV.,"Pursued with fear, and flung her from the selle,"
1676,IV.,Soft slipping on a bank of springy moss
1677,IV.,That couched her swooning. In an utter loss
1678,IV.,Of mind and limbs she only knew twas thus--
1679,IV.,As one who pants beneath an incubus:--
1680,IV.,The boar thrust toward her a tusked snout and fanged
1681,IV.,"Of hideous bristles, and the whole wood clanged"
1682,IV.,And buzzed and boomed a thousand sounds and lights
1683,IV.,"Lawless about her brain, like leaves fierce nights"
1684,IV.,Of hurricane harvest shouting: then she knew
1685,IV.,A fury thunder twixt it--and fleet flew
1686,IV.,Rich-rooted moss and sandy loam that held
1687,IV.,"Dark-buried shadows of the wild, and swelled"
1688,IV.,"Continual echoes with the thud of strife,"
1689,IV.,And breath of man and brute that warred for life;
1690,IV.,"And all the air, made mad with foam and forms,"
1691,IV.,"Spun froth and wrestled twixt her hair and arms,"
1692,IV.,While trampled caked the stricken leaves or shred
1693,IV.,"Hummed whirling, and snapped brittle branches dead."
1694,IV.,"And when she rose and leaned her throbbing head,"
1695,IV.,Which burst its uncoifed rays of raven hair
1696,IV.,"Down swelling shoulders pure and faultless fair,"
1697,IV.,"On one milk, marvelous arm of fluid grace,"
1698,IV.,Beheld the brute thing throttled and the face
1699,IV.,"Of angry Urience over, browed like Might,"
1700,IV.,"One red, swoln arm, that pinned the hairy fright,"
1701,IV.,"Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn;"
1702,IV.,"Dug in his midriff, the close knees updrawn"
1703,IV.,Wedged deep the glutton sides that quaked and strove
1704,IV.,"A shaggy bulk, whose sharp hoofs horny drove."
1705,IV.,Thus man and brute burned bent; when Urience slipped
1706,IV.,"One arm, the horror's tearing tusks had ripped"
1707,IV.,"And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,"
1708,IV.,Which at his hip hung long a haft gold-gilt;
1709,IV.,Its rapid splinter drew; beamed twice and thrice
1710,IV.,High in the sun its ghastliness of ice
1711,IV.,"Plunged--and the great boar, stretched in sullen death,"
1712,IV.,"Weakened thro' wild veins, groaned laborious breath."
1713,IV.,
1714,IV.,And how he brought her water from a well
1715,IV.,"That rustled freshness near them, as it fell"
1716,IV.,"From its full-mantled urn, in his deep casque,"
1717,IV.,"And prayed her quaff; then bathed her brow, a task"
1718,IV.,That had accompaning tears of joy and vows
1719,IV.,"Of love, sweet intercourse of eyes and brows,"
1720,IV.,And many clinging kisses eloquent.
1721,IV.,"And how, when dressed his arm, behind him bent"
1722,IV.,She clasped him on the same steed and they went
1723,IV.,"On thro' the gold wood toward the golden West,"
1724,IV.,Till on one low hill's forest-covered crest
1725,IV.,Up in the gold his castle's battlements pressed.
1726,IV.,And then she felt she'd loved him till had come
1727,IV.,"Fame of the love of Isoud, whom from home"
1728,IV.,"Brought knightly Tristram o'er the Irish foam,"
1729,IV.,And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake.
1730,IV.,And then how passion from these seemed to wake
1731,IV.,Longing for some great gallant who would slake--
1732,IV.,And such found Accolon.
1733,IV.,And then she thought
1734,IV.,How far she'd fallen and how darkly fraught
1735,IV.,With consequence was this. Then what distress
1736,IV.,Were hers and his--her lover's; and success
1737,IV.,"How doubly difficult if Arthur slain,"
1738,IV.,King Urience lived to assert his right to reign.
1739,IV.,So paused she pondering on the blade; her lips
1740,IV.,Breathless and close as close cold finger tips
1741,IV.,"Hugged the huge weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,"
1742,IV.,"""Nay! long, too long hast lived who shouldst have died"
1743,IV.,Even in the womb abortive! who these years
1744,IV.,"Hast leashed sweet life to care with stinging tears,"
1745,IV.,A knot thus harshly severed!--As thou art
1746,IV.,"Into the elements naked!"""
1747,IV.,O'er his heart
1748,IV.,"The long sword hesitated, lean as crime,"
1749,IV.,Descended redly once. And like a rhyme
1750,IV.,"Of nice words fairly fitted forming on,--"
1751,IV.,"A sudden ceasing and the harmony gone,"
1752,IV.,"So ran to death the life of Urience,"
1753,IV.,A strong song incomplete of broken sense.
1754,IV.,There glowered the crimeful Queen. The glistening sword
1755,IV.,"Unfleshed, flung by her wronged and murdered lord;"
1756,IV.,And the dark blood spread broader thro' the sheet
1757,IV.,To drip a horror at impassive feet
1758,IV.,And blur the polished oak. But lofty she
1759,IV.,"Stood proud, relentless; in her ecstacy"
1760,IV.,A lovely devil; a crowned lust that cried
1761,IV.,On Accolon; that harlot which defied
1762,IV.,Heaven with a voice of pulses clamorous as
1763,IV.,Steep storm that down a cavernous mountain pass
1764,IV.,Blasphemes an hundred echoes; with like power
1765,IV.,The inner harlot called its paramour:
1766,IV.,"Him whom King Arthur had commanded, when"
1767,IV.,"Borne from the lists, be granted her again"
1768,IV.,"As his blithe gift and welcome from that joust,"
1769,IV.,For treacherous love and her adulterous lust.
1770,IV.,And while she stood revolving how her deed's
1771,IV.,"Concealment were secured,--a grind of steeds,"
1772,IV.,"Arms, jingling stirrups, voices loud that cursed"
1773,IV.,Fierce in the northern court. To her athirst
1774,IV.,"For him her lover, war and power it spoke,"
1775,IV.,Him victor and so King; and then awoke
1776,IV.,"A yearning to behold, to quit the dead."
1777,IV.,"So a wild specter down wide stairs she fled,"
1778,IV.,"Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail,"
1779,IV.,That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.
1780,IV.,"To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,"
1781,IV.,"Down from a steaming steed into her ears,"
1782,IV.,"""This from the King, a boon!"" laughed harsh and hoarse;"
1783,IV.,"Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer with force,"
1784,IV.,"Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn and red,"
1785,IV.,Crusted with blood a knight in armor--dead;
1786,IV.,"Even Accolon, tossed with the mocking scoff"
1787,IV.,"""This from the King!""--phantoms in fog rode off."
1788,IV.,And what remains? From Camelot to Gore
1789,IV.,"That right she weeping fled; then to the shore,--"
1790,IV.,"As that romancer tells,--Avilion,"
1791,IV.,Where she hath Majesty gold-crowned yet wan;
1792,IV.,In darkest cypress a frail pitious face
1793,IV.,Queenly and lovely; 'round sad eyes the trace
1794,IV.,Of immemorial tears as for some crime:
1795,IV.,"They future fixed, expectant of the time"
1796,IV.,When the forgiving Arthur cometh and
1797,IV.,Shall have to rule all that lost golden land
1798,IV.,That drifts vague amber in forgotten seas
1799,IV.,Of surgeless turquoise dim with mysteries.
1800,IV.,"And so was seen Morgana nevermore,"
1801,IV.,Save once when from the Cornwall coast she bore
1802,IV.,The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight
1803,IV.,Of Camlan in a black barge into night.
1804,IV.,But oft some see her with a palfried band
1805,IV.,Of serge-stoled maidens thro' the drowsy land
1806,IV.,Of Autumn glimmer; when are sharply strewn
1807,IV.,"The red leaves, while broad in the east a moon"
1808,IV.,"Swings full of frost a lustrous globe of gleams,"
1809,IV.,Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams.

1915,DER FREISCHUTZ.,His mind to live a forester and be

1983,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Thou or thy daughter, and inspire for good."""
1984,DER FREISCHUTZ.,
1985,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A year thereafter was it that I heard
1986,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe,"
1987,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Then their betrothal. And it was from this,--"
1988,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"For, ah, that Ilsabe! that Ilsabe!--"
1989,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Good Mary Mother! how she haunts me yet!
1990,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"She, that true touchstone which philosophers feign"
1991,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Contacts and golds all base; a woman who
1992,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Could touch all evil into good in man.--
1993,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Surmised I of the excellency which
1994,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Refinement of her gentle company,"
1995,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Warm presence of chaste beauty, had resolved"
1996,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"His fiery nature to, conditioning slave."
1997,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And so I came from Brunswick--as you know--
1998,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal"
1999,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Commissioned proxy, his commissioner,--"
2000,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To test the marksmanship of Rudolf who
2001,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,"
2002,DER FREISCHUTZ.,An heir of Kuno.--He?--Great grandfather
2003,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Of Kurt, and one this forestkeepership"
2004,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Was first possesor of; established thus--
2005,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Or such the tale they told me 'round the hearths.
2006,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,"
2007,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came"
2008,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"With vast magnificence of knights and hounds,"
2009,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And satin-tuniced nobles curled and plumed
2010,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To hunt Thuringian deer. Then Morn too slow
2011,DER FREISCHUTZ.,On her blithe feet was; quick with laughing eyes
2012,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To morrow mortal eyes and lazy limbs;
2013,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Rather on tip-toed hills recumbent yawned,"
2014,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Aroused an hour too soon; ashamed, disrobed,"
2015,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close,"
2016,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"While brayed the hollow horns and bayed lean hounds,"
2017,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And cheered gallants until the dingles dinned,"
2018,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Where searched the climbing mists or, compact light,"
2019,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Fled breathless white, clung scared a moted gray,"
2020,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Low unsunned cloudlands of the castled hills.
2021,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And then near mid-noon from a swarthy brake
2022,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,"
2023,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Lashed to whose back with grinding knotted cords,"
2024,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Borne with whom like a nightmare's incubus,"
2025,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A man shrieked; burry-bearded and his hair
2026,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Kinked with dry, tangled burrs, and he himself"
2027,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Emaciated and half naked. From
2028,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"The wear of wildest passage thro' the wild,"
2029,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Rent red by briars, torn and bruised by rocks."
2030,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"--For, such the law then, when the peasant chased"
2031,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,"
2032,DER FREISCHUTZ.,As punishment the torturing withes and spine
2033,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Of some big stag, a gift of game and wild"
2034,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Enough till death--death in the antlered herd
2035,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Or crawling famine in bleak, haggard haunts."
2036,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Then was the dark Duke glad, and forthwith cried"
2037,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To all his dewy train a rich reward
2038,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"For him who slew the stag and saved the man,"
2039,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"But death to him who slew the man and stag,"
2040,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The careless error of a loose attempt.
2041,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"So crashed the hunt along wild, glimmering ways"
2042,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Thro' creepers and vast brush beneath gnarled trees,"
2043,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Up a scorched torrent's bed. Yet still refused
2044,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Each that sure shot; the risk too desperate
2045,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The poor life and the golden gift beside.
2046,DER FREISCHUTZ.,So this young Kuno with two eyes wherein
2047,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Hunt with excitement kindled reckless fire
2048,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Clamored, ""And are ye cowards?--Good your grace,"
2049,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"You shall not chafe!--The fiend direct my ball!"""
2050,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And fired into a covert deeply packed,"
2051,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"An intertangled wall of matted night,"
2052,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive
2053,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To pierce one foot or earn one point beyond.
2054,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake"
2055,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Heart-hit and perished. That wan wretch unhurt
2056,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Soon bondless lay condoled. But the great Duke,"
2057,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Charmed with the eagle shot, admired the youth,"
2058,DER FREISCHUTZ.,There to him and his heirs forever gave
2059,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The forest keepership.
2060,DER FREISCHUTZ.,But envious tongues
2061,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale
2062,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Of how the shot was free, and that the balls"
2063,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Used by young Kuno were free bullets, which"
2064,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Molded were cast in influence of the fiend
2065,DER FREISCHUTZ.,By magic and directed by the fiend.
2066,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of some effect these tales were and some force
2067,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Had with the Duke, who lent an ear so far"
2068,DER FREISCHUTZ.,As to ordain Kuno's descendants all
2069,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To proof of skill ere their succession to
2070,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot
2071,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The silver ring from out the popinjay's beak--
2072,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"A good shot he, you see, who would succeed."
2073,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The Devil guards his mysteries close as God.
2074,DER FREISCHUTZ.,For who can say what elementaries
2075,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Demoniac lurk in desolate dells and woods
2076,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Shadowy? malicious vassals of that power
2077,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Who signs himself, thro' these, a slave to those,"
2078,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Those mortals who act open with his Hell,"
2079,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Those only who seek secretly and woo.
2080,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Of these free, fatal bullets let me speak:"
2081,DER FREISCHUTZ.,There may be such; our Earth hath things as strange;
2082,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Then only in coarse fancies may exist;
2083,DER FREISCHUTZ.,For fancy is among our peasantry
2084,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A limber juggler with the weird and dark;
2085,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"For Superstition hides not her grim face,"
2086,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"A skeleton grin on leprous ghastliness,"
2087,DER FREISCHUTZ.,From Ignorance's mossy thatches low.
2088,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"A cross-way, as I heard, among gaunt hills,"
2089,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A solitude convulsed of rocks and trees
2090,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Blasted; and on the stony cross-road drawn
2091,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A bloody circle with a bloody sword;
2092,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Herein rude characters; a skull and thighs
2093,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Fantastic fixed before a fitful fire
2094,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of spiteful coals. Eleven of the clock
2095,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Cast, the first bullet leaves the mold,--the lead"
2096,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark,"
2097,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Burnt blood,--the wounded Sacramental Host,"
2098,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Unswallowed and unhallowed, oozed when shot"
2099,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Fixed to a riven pine.--Ere twelve o'clock,"
2100,DER FREISCHUTZ.,When dwindling specters in their rotting shrouds
2101,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Quit musty tombs to mumble hollow woes
2102,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"In Midnight's horrored ear, with never a cry,"
2103,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Word or weak whisper, till that hour sound,"
2104,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Must the free balls be cast; and these shall be
2105,DER FREISCHUTZ.,In number three and sixty; three of which
2106,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Semial--he the Devil's minister--
2107,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Claims for his master and stamps as his own
2108,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"To hit awry their mark, askew for harm."
2109,DER FREISCHUTZ.,_Those other sixty shall not miss their mark._
2110,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"No cry, no word, no whisper, tho' there gibe"
2111,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Most monstrous shapes that flicker in thick mist
2112,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Lewd human countenances or leer out
2113,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Swoln animal faces with fair forms of men,"
2114,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"While wide-winged owls fan the drear, dying coals,"
2115,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"That lick thin, slender tongues of purple fire"
2116,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"From viperous red, and croaks the night-hawk near."
2117,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"No cry, no word, no whisper should there come"
2118,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Weeping a wandering form with weary, white"
2119,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And pleading countenance of her you love,"
2120,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Faded with tears of waiting; beckoning
2121,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"With gray, large arms or censuring; her shame"
2122,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"In dull and desolate eyes; who, if you speak"
2123,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Or stagger from that circle--hideous change!--
2124,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Shrinks, faced a hag of million wrinkles, which"
2125,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Ridge scaly sharpness of protruding bones,"
2126,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To rip you limb from limb with taloned claws.
2127,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell
2128,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Boom that anticipated hour, nor leave"
2129,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"By one short inch the bloody orbit, for"
2130,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The minion varlets of Hell's majesty
2131,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Expectant cirque its dim circumference.
2132,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"But when the hour of midnight smites, be sure"
2133,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"You have your bullets, neither more nor less;"
2134,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"For, if thro' fear one more or less you have,"
2135,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Your soul is forfeit to those agencies,"
2136,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Right rathe who are to rend it from the flesh.
2137,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And while that hour of midnight sounds a din
2138,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of hurrying hoofs and shouting outriders--
2139,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Six snorting steeds postilioned roll a stage
2140,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire,"
2141,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"""Room there!--ho! ho!--who bars the mountain-way!"
2142,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"On over him!""--but fear not nor fare forth,--"
2143,DER FREISCHUTZ.,'Tis but the last trick of your bounden slave:
2144,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And ere the red moon strives from dingy clouds
2145,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And dives again, high the huge leaders leap"
2146,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Iron fore-hoofs flashing and big eyes like gledes,"
2147,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And, spun a spiral spark into the night,"
2148,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Whistling the phantom flies and fades away.
2149,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Some say there comes no stage, but Hackelnburg,"
2150,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Wild Huntsman of the Harz, rides hoarse in storm,"
2151,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Dashing the dead leaves with dark dogs of hell
2152,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Direful thro' whirling thickets, and his horn"
2153,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Croaks doleful as an owl's hoot while he hurls
2154,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Straight 'neath rain-streaming skies of echoes, sheer"
2155,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Plunging the magic circle horse and hounds.
2156,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And then will come, plutonian clad and slim,"
2157,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Upon a stallion vast intensely black,"
2158,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Semial, Satan's lurid minister,"
2159,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To hail you and inform you and assure.--
2160,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Enough! these wives-tales heard to what I've seen;
2161,DER FREISCHUTZ.,To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf there
2162,DER FREISCHUTZ.,With Kurt and all his picturesque foresters
2163,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Met me. And then the rounding year was ripe;
2164,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Throbbing the red heart of full Autumn: When
2165,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Each morning gleams crisp frost on shriveled fields;
2166,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Each noon sits veiled in mysteries of mist;
2167,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Each night unrolls a miracle woof of stars,"
2168,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Where moon--bare-bosomed goddess of the hunt--
2169,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Wades calm, crushed clouds or treads the vaster blue."
2170,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve
2171,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"The test of Rudolf's skill postponed, with which"
2172,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Annoyed he seemed. And so it was I heard
2173,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"How he an execrable marksman was,"
2174,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And whispered tales of near, incredible shots"
2175,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"That wryed their mark, while in his flint-lock's pan"
2176,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Flashed often harmless powder, while wild game"
2177,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Stared fearless on him and indulgent stood,"
2178,DER FREISCHUTZ.,An open butt to such wide marksmanship.
2179,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Howbeit, he that day acquitted him"
2180,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of these maligners' cavils; in the hunt
2181,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Missing no shot however rash he made
2182,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Or distant thro' thick intercepting trees;
2183,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And the piled, curious game brought down of all"
2184,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Good marksmen of that train had not sufficed,"
2185,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Doubled, nay, trebled, to have matched his heap."
2186,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"And wonderstruck the _jägers_ saw, nor knew"
2187,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,"
2188,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Still swore that only yesterday old Kurt
2189,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Had touched his daughter's tears and Rudolf's wrath
2190,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"By vowing end to their betrothéd love,"
2191,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Unless that love developed better aim
2192,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Against the morrow's test; his ancestor's
2193,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"High fame should not be damaged. So he stormed,"
2194,DER FREISCHUTZ.,But bowed his gray head and wept silently;
2195,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Then looking up forgave when big he saw
2196,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone
2197,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Forth in the night that wailed with coming storm.
2198,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Before this inn, The Owl, assembled came"
2199,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The nice-primped villagers to view the trial:
2200,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Fair _fräuleins_ and blonde, comely, healthy _fraus_;"
2201,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Stout burgers. And among them I did mark
2202,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Kurt and his daughter. He, a florid face"
2203,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of pride and joy for Rudolf's strange success;
2204,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"She, radiant and flounced in flowing garb"
2205,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Of bridal white deep-draped and crowned with flowers;
2206,DER FREISCHUTZ.,For Kurt insisted this their marriage eve
2207,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Should Rudolf come successful from the chase.
2208,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,"
2209,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The test of skill superfluous seemed and so
2210,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Was on the bare brink of announcement, when,"
2211,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Out of the evening heaven's hardening red,"
2212,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Like a white warning loosed for augury,"
2213,DER FREISCHUTZ.,A word of God some fallen angel prized
2214,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"As his last all of heaven, penitent,"
2215,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Hell-freed, sent minister to save a soul,"
2216,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,"
2217,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"A wafted waif, pruned settled on a bough:"
2218,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Then I, ""Thy weapon, Rudolph, pierce its head!"""
2219,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Cried pointing, ""And chief-forester art thou!"""
2220,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Pale as a mist and wavering he turned;
2221,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"""I had a dream--"" then faltered as he aimed,"
2222,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"""A woman's whim!"" But starting from the press"
2223,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Screamed Ilsabe, ""My dove!"" to plead its life"
2224,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Came--cracked the rifle and untouched the dove
2225,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Rose beating lustrous wings, but Ilsabe--"
2226,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"""God's wrath! the sight!""--fell smitten, and the blood"
2227,DER FREISCHUTZ.,Sprang red from shattered brow and silent hair--
2228,DER FREISCHUTZ.,That bullet strangely thro' her brow and brain....
2229,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And what of Rudolf? ah! of him you ask?
2230,DER FREISCHUTZ.,That proud Franconian who would scoff at Fate
2231,DER FREISCHUTZ.,And scorn all state; who cried black Satan friend
2232,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Sooner than our white Christ;--why, he went mad"
2233,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"O' the moment, and into the haunted Harz"
2234,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Fled, an unholy thing, and perished there"
2235,DER FREISCHUTZ.,The prey of demons of the Dummburg. But
2236,DER FREISCHUTZ.,I one of few less superstitious who
2237,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"Say, as the finale of a madman's deed,"
2238,DER FREISCHUTZ.,"He in the Bodé, from that ragged rock,"

4233,IV.,"There are some strange words, which have been retained, as the author"

4235,IV.,
4236,IV.,"e.g. 'aventured spears', which may have been quartz-tipped (aventurine);"
4237,IV.,"'beryle', possibly referring to the color of beryl (light green, etc.);"
4238,IV.,"'bowldered', alternative spelling for 'bouldered'; 'guant', which may be"
4239,IV.,"'gaunt misspelled, or it may refer to a bird (guan)... ""Laughed the"
4240,IV.,"guant guards among the crowd""; etc. And 'accompaning' still needs to"
4241,IV.,elide the second 'a' to fit the metre.
4242,IV.,
4243,IV.,"Some words are obviously ancient, or dialectic, and some are akin to"
4244,IV.,some of the words in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins.
4245,IV.,"The transcriber prefers not to change anything the author wrote, as a"
4246,IV.,slightly different spelling may also imply a slightly different
4247,IV.,inflexion.
4248,IV.,
