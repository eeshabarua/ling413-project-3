45,PREFACE,
46,PREFACE,One who after writing prose all his life suddenly essays to launch a
47,PREFACE,"volume of verse, must know something of the feeling with which an"
48,PREFACE,old-time sailor after coasting only his native shores found himself
49,PREFACE,setting sail into an unknown sea.
50,PREFACE,
51,PREFACE,The author of this little volume knows quite as well as the most
52,PREFACE,experienced mariner the temerity of sailing an untried main in so frail
53,PREFACE,"a bark.  But he is willing, if the Fates so decree, to go down with the"
54,PREFACE,unnumbered sail of that great fleet which have throughout the ages
55,PREFACE,"faced the wide ocean of oblivion, merely for the thrill of being for a"
56,PREFACE,brief space on its vast waters.
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,"Since Horace, secure in the double endowment of genius and of an"
59,PREFACE,"Emperor's favor, wrote scornfully how hated of gods and men was"
60,PREFACE,"middling verse, no one has ever doubted the fact--perhaps, not even one"
61,PREFACE,of all the myriads who have dared to brave that bitter scorn.  The
62,PREFACE,explanation then for the production of so much of the despised matter
63,PREFACE,must be that there is for the minor poet also a music that the outer
64,PREFACE,world does not catch--an inner day which the outer world does not see.
65,PREFACE,"It is this music, this light which, for the most part, is for the"
66,PREFACE,"lesser poet his only reward.  That he has heard, however brokenly, and"
67,PREFACE,"at however vast a distance, snatches of those strains which thrilled"
68,PREFACE,"the souls of Marlowe and Milton and Keats and Shelley, even though he"
69,PREFACE,"may never reproduce one of them, is moreover a sufficiently high reward."

190,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
191,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,There is a land not charted on all charts;
192,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Though many mariners have touched its coast,"
193,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Who far adventuring in those distant parts,"
194,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Meet ship-wreck there and are forever lost;
195,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Or if they e'er return, are soon once more"
196,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Borne far away by hunger for that magic shore.
197,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
198,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Its mystic mountains on the horizon piled,"
199,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Some mariners have glimpsed when driven far
200,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Out of life's measured course by tempests wild,"
201,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Or lured therefrom by the erratic star
202,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"They chose as pilot, till their errant guide"
203,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Drew them resistlessly within its witching tide.
204,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
205,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"For oft, they tell, who know its sapphire strand"
206,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"The golden haze enfolding it hangs low,"
207,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And those who careless steer may miss the land,"
208,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Embosomed in the sunset's purple glow,"
209,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Its lights mistaken for the evening stars,"
210,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Its music for the surf-beat on its golden bars.
211,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
212,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Young Jason found it when he dauntless sought
213,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"The golden fleece by Colchis' perilous stream,"
214,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,And in his track full many an argonaut
215,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Hath found the rare fleece of his golden dream,"
216,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And at the last, Ulysses-like, surcease"
217,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,From Sorrow's dole and Labor's heavy prease.
218,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
219,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"One voyager charted it for every age,"
220,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,From azure rim to starry mountain core.
221,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"A nameless player on the World's great stage,"
222,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"He spread his sails, adventured to that shore"
223,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And reared a pharos with his art sublime,"
224,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Like Ilion's song-wrought towers, to beacon every clime."
225,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
226,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,The great adventurers reached it when they brake
227,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Columbus-led into the unknown West,"
228,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And those who followed in their shining wake,"
229,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,But left no trace of where their keels have pressed;
230,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Yet have through stress of storm and tempests' rage
231,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Won by his quenchless light a happy anchorage.
232,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
233,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"There rest the heroes of lost causes lorn,"
234,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,On their calm brows more fadeless chaplets far
235,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Than all their conquerors' could e'er adorn,"
236,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,When shone effulgent Fame's ascendant star;
237,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,There fallen patriots reap the glorious prize
238,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Of deathless memory of their precious sacrifice.
239,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
240,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"There many a dream-faced maid and matron dwells,"
241,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,From Argive Helen on through gliding time;
242,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"There drink the poets draughts from crystal wells,"
243,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,And choir high music to their harps sublime:
244,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,And there the great philosophers discourse
245,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Divine Philosophy in due and tranquil course.
246,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
247,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,There not alone the great and lofty sing;
248,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,But silent poets too find there the song
249,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,They only sang in dreams when wandering
250,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Amazed and lost amid the earthly throng;
251,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Their hearts unfettered all from worldly fears.
252,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Attuned to meet the spacious music of the spheres:
253,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
254,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Gray, wrinkled men, the sea-salt in their hair,"
255,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Their eyes set deep with peering through the gloom,"
256,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Their voices low with speaking ever, where"
257,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,The surges break beneath the mountains' loom;
258,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"But deep within their yearning, burning eyes"
259,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,The light reflected ever from those radiant skies.
260,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
261,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"There fadeless Youth, unknowing of annoy,"
262,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Walks aye with changeless Love; and Sorrow there
263,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Is but a memory to hallow Joy,"
264,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"With chastened Happiness so deep and rare,"
265,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Well-nigh the Heart aches with its rich content,"
266,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,And Hope with full fruition evermore is blent.
267,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
268,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Constant Penelope, her web complete,"
269,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Rests there content at last and smiling down
270,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,On worn Ulysses basking at her feet;
271,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Calm Beatrice wears joyously the crown
272,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Bestowed by exiled Dante in his grief,"
273,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And Laura, kind, gives Petrarch's tuneful heart relief."
274,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
275,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"'Mid bloomy meadows laved by limpid streams,"
276,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Repose the Muses and the Graces sweet;
277,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,There kiss we lips we only kissed in dreams
278,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Meshed in the grosser world; and there we meet
279,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"The fair and flower-like lost loves of our Youth,"
280,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,When unafraid we trod the ways with radiant Truth.
281,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
282,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,Those who return have pressed alone the coast;
283,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,But tell of some lost in that charmèd strond:
284,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Aspiring souls who loving Honor most,"
285,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"Have sought the crystal mountain-tops beyond,"
286,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,"And striven upward, heedless of their scars,"
287,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,To where all paths lead ever to the shining stars.
288,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
289,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
290,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
291,THE COAST OF BOHEMIA,
292,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,THE VOICE OF THE SEA
293,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
294,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Thus spake to Man the thousand-throated Sea;
295,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Words which the stealing winds caught from its lips:
296,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
297,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
298,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Thou thinkest thee and thine, God's topmost crown."
299,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,But hearken unto me and humbly learn
300,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,How infinite thine insignificance.
301,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Thou boastest of thine age--thy works--thyself:
302,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Thine oldest monuments of which thou prat'st
303,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Were built but yesterday when measured by
304,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Yon snow-domed mountains of eternal rock:
305,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The Earth, thy mother, from whose breast thou draw'st,"
306,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The sweat-stained living which she wills to give,"
307,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"And in whose dust thine own must melt again,"
308,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Was agèd cycles ere thine earliest dawn;--
309,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,But they to me are young: I gave them birth.
310,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Climb up those heaven-tipt peaks thy dizziest height,"
311,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Thou there shalt read, graved deep, my name and age;"
312,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Dig down thy deepest depth, shalt read them still."
313,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Before the mountains sprang, before the Earth,"
314,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Thy cradle and thy tomb, was made, I was:"
315,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"God called them forth from me, as thee from Earth."
316,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Thou burrow'st through a mountain, here and there,"
317,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Work'st all thine engines, cutting off a speck;"
318,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I wash their rock-foundations under; tear
319,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Turret from turret, toppling thundering down,"
320,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And crush their mightiest fragments into sand:
321,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Thou gravest with thy records slab and spar,"
322,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And callest them memorials of thy Might;--
323,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Lo! not a stone exists, from yon black cliff"
324,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"To that small pebble at thy foot, but bears"
325,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"My signature graved there when Earth was young,"
326,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,To teach the mighty wonders of the Deep.
327,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Thy deeds--thyself--are what?  A morning mist!
328,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,But I!  I face the ages.  Dost not know
329,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,That as I gave the Earth to spread her fair
330,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"And dew-washed body in the morning light,"
331,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"So, still, 't is I that keep her fair and fresh?--"
332,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,That weave her robes and nightly diamond them?
333,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I fill her odorous bowers with perfumes rare;
334,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Strew field and forest with bee-haunted stars;
335,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"I give the Morn pearl for her radiant roof,"
336,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And Eve lend glory for her rosy dome;
337,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I build the purple towers that hold the West
338,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And guard the passage of Retiring Day.
339,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Thy frailest fabric far outlasts thyself:
340,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The pyramids rise from the desert sands,"
341,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Their builders blown in dust about their feet.
342,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The winged bull looms mid an alien race,"
343,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Grim, silent, lone.  But whither went the King?"
344,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"I cool the lambent air upon my breast,"
345,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And send the winds forth on mine embassies;
346,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"I offer all my body to the Sun,"
347,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"And lade our caravans with merchandise,"
348,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,To carry wealth and plenty to all climes.
349,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Yon fleecy continents of floating snow,"
350,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"That dwarf the mountains over which they sail,"
351,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Are but my bales borne by my messengers,"
352,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,To cheer and gladden every thirsty land.
353,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The Arab by his palm-girt desert pool,"
354,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The Laplander above his frozen rill,"
355,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The Woodsman crouched beside his forest brook,"
356,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"The shepherd mirrored in his upland spring,"
357,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Drink of my cup in one great brotherhood.
358,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"'T is, nay, not man alone--thou art but one"
359,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Of all the myriads of life-holding things,--"
360,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Brute, beast, bird, reptile, insect, thing unnamed,"
361,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Whose souls find recreation in my breath:
362,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Nay, not a tree, flower, sprig of grass or weed,"
363,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,But lives through me and hymns my praise to God:
364,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"I feed, sustain, refresh and keep them all:"
365,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Mirror and type of God that giveth life.
366,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I sing as softly as a mother croons
367,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Her drowsy babe to sleep upon her breast.
368,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"On quiet nights when all my winds are laid,"
369,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I wile the stars down from their azure home
370,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,To sink with golden footprints in my depths:
371,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"I show the silvered pathway to the moon,"
372,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"All paved with gems the errant Pleiad lost,"
373,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,That night she strayed from her sisters wan;
374,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,But I sing other times strains from that song
375,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Before whose awfulness my waters sank,"
376,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"And at whose harmony the mountains rose,"
377,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I heard that morning when the breath of God
378,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Moved on my face, and said, Let there be light!"
379,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,I thrill and tremble since but at the thought
380,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"Of that great wonder of that greatest dawn,"
381,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"When at God's word the brooding darkness rose,"
382,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,Which veiled my face from all the birth of things
383,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"And rolled far frighted from its resting-place,"
384,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"To bide henceforth beyond Day's crystal walls,"
385,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,"While all the morning stars together sang,"
386,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,And on the instant God stood full revealed!
387,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
388,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
389,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
390,THE VOICE OF THE SEA,
391,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB
392,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,
393,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"'Twas the marble crypt where the Emperor lay,"
394,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"His mighty marshals on either side,"
395,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,Guarding his couch since the solemn day
396,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"France brought him home in her chastened pride,"
397,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"To sleep on her heart, from the sea-girt cage"
398,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,Where the Eagle pined and died in his rage.
399,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,
400,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"I thought of the long, red carnival"
401,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"Death held in the track of his sword, amain,"
402,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,From Toulon's bloom to the crimsoned pall
403,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,He spread upon Waterloo's ripened grain;
404,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,I thought of the long black years of dread
405,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,When the nations quaked at his armies' tread.
406,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,
407,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,A-sudden above as the twilight fell
408,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,The deathly silence around was shocked
409,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,By the roll of a drum.  At the throbbing swell
410,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,"The vaulted dome of the Heavens rocked,"
411,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,Till it seemed that the mighty conqueror's soul
412,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,Was shaking the earth in that drum's long roll.
413,LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB,

862,THE BENT MONK,"With eyes cast down as in despair,"
863,THE BENT MONK,And shoulders stooped with weight of woes
864,THE BENT MONK,And lips from which unceasing flows
865,THE BENT MONK,An agonizèd prayer.
866,THE BENT MONK,
867,THE BENT MONK,His form is bent; his step is slow;
868,THE BENT MONK,His hands with fasting long are thin;
869,THE BENT MONK,"And wheresoe'er his footsteps go,"
870,THE BENT MONK,Men hear his muttered prayer and know
871,THE BENT MONK,He weeps for deadly sin.
872,THE BENT MONK,
873,THE BENT MONK,This monk was once the knightliest
874,THE BENT MONK,Of knights who ever sat in hall:
875,THE BENT MONK,With wondrous might and beauty blest;
876,THE BENT MONK,And whoso met him lance-in-rest

884,THE BENT MONK,
885,THE BENT MONK,They say he wooed her long and well;
886,THE BENT MONK,And splendid spoils both eve and morn
887,THE BENT MONK,"Of song and tourney won, they tell,"
888,THE BENT MONK,"He gave her till at last she fell,"
889,THE BENT MONK,Then drave her forth with scorn.
890,THE BENT MONK,
891,THE BENT MONK,The world was cold; her father's door
892,THE BENT MONK,Was barred--they thus the tale repeat--
893,THE BENT MONK,Her name was heard in jousts no more;
894,THE BENT MONK,"And so, one day the river bore"
895,THE BENT MONK,And laid her at his feet.

897,THE BENT MONK,"Her brow was calm, the sunny hair"

903,THE BENT MONK,The old men say that when the wave
904,THE BENT MONK,"That burden brought, then backward fled,"

915,THE BENT MONK,"And ever since he tells his beads,"
916,THE BENT MONK,"And sackcloth lieth next his skin,"

921,THE BENT MONK,"For his own soul he hath no care,"
922,THE BENT MONK,By penance purged as if by flame:

940,THE MESSAGE,"Writ by a Master so divine,"
941,THE MESSAGE,The Love seems ever mine and thine.
942,THE MESSAGE,The volume opened at the place
943,THE MESSAGE,That sings of sweet Francesca's grace:
944,THE MESSAGE,How reading of Fair Guinevere
945,THE MESSAGE,"And Launcelot that long gone year,"
946,THE MESSAGE,Her eyes into her lover's fell
947,THE MESSAGE,And--there was nothing more to tell.
948,THE MESSAGE,That day they op'ed that book no more:
949,THE MESSAGE,Thenceforth they read a deeper lore.
950,THE MESSAGE,
951,THE MESSAGE,"Beneath the passage so divine,"
952,THE MESSAGE,"Some woman's hand had traced a line,"
953,THE MESSAGE,And reverently upon the spot

955,THE MESSAGE,"A message sent across the years,"
956,THE MESSAGE,Of Lovers' sighs and Lovers' tears:
957,THE MESSAGE,A messenger left there to tell
958,THE MESSAGE,They too had loved each other well.
959,THE MESSAGE,The centuries had glided by

984,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"I was wicked enough, God wot, at best,"
985,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,And weary enough to covet rest.
986,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
987,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I paused at th' door with a timid knock:
988,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The People within were a silken flock--
989,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,By their scowls of pride it was plain to see
990,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,Salvation was not for the likes of me.
991,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
992,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"The Bishop was there in his lace and lawn,"
993,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"And the cassocked priest,--I saw him yawn,--"
994,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"The rich and great and virtuous too,"
995,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,Stood smug and contented each in his pew.
996,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
997,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"The music was grand,--the service fine,"
998,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"The sermon was eloquent,--nigh divine."
999,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"The subject was, Pride and the Pharisee,"
1000,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"And the Publican, who was just like me."
1001,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1002,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"I smote my breast in an empty pew,"
1003,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,But an usher came and looked me through
1004,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,And bade me stand beside the door
1005,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,In the space reserved for the mean and poor.
1006,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1007,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I left the church in my rags and shame:
1008,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"In the dark without, One called my name."
1009,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""They have turned me out as well,"" quoth He,"
1010,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""Take thou my hand and come fare with me."
1011,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1012,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""We may find the light by a narrow gate,"
1013,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The way is steep and rough and strait;
1014,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"But none will look if your clothes be poor,"
1015,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"When you come at last to my Father's door."""
1016,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1017,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I struggled on where 'er He led:
1018,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The blood ran down from His hand so red!
1019,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The blood ran down from His forehead torn.
1020,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""'Tis naught,"" quoth He, ""but the prick of a thorn!"""
1021,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1022,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""You bleed,"" I cried, for my heart 'gan quail."
1023,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""'Tis naught, 'tis naught but the print of a nail."""
1024,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""You limp in pain and your feet are sore."""
1025,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""Yea, yea,"" quoth He, ""for the nails they were four."""
1026,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1027,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""You are weary and faint and bent,"" I cried."
1028,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""'Twas a load I bore up a mountain side."""
1029,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""The way is steep, and I faint.""  But He:"
1030,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""It was steeper far upon Calvary."""
1031,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1032,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"By this we had come to a narrow door,"
1033,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I had spied afar.  It was locked before;
1034,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"But now in the presence of my Guide,"
1035,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The fast-closed postern opened wide.
1036,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1037,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,And forth there streamed a radiance
1038,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,More bright than is the noon-sun's glance;

1040,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,The music of the Seraphim.
1041,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1042,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I knew His face where the light did fall:
1043,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"I had spat in it, in Herod's Hall,"
1044,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"I knew those nail-prints now, ah, me!--"
1045,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,I had helped to nail Him to a tree.
1046,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1047,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"I fainting fell before His face,"
1048,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,Imploring pardon of His grace.
1049,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"He stooped and silencing my moan,"
1050,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,He bore me near to His Father's throne.
1051,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,
1052,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"He wrapt me close and hid my shame,"
1053,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,And touched my heart with a cleansing flame.
1054,THE NEEDLE'S EYE,"""Rest here,"" said He, ""while I go and try"

1308,MY MOTHER,Her life was patterned on His life.
1309,MY MOTHER,Now when her eyes grow dim

1315,MY MOTHER,"So, ever in her face"
1316,MY MOTHER,Shines Heaven's divinest grace.
1317,MY MOTHER,Her soul is fresh and mild
1318,MY MOTHER,As is a little child.
1319,MY MOTHER,And as the fleshly tenement
1320,MY MOTHER,"With age grows worn and bent,"
1321,MY MOTHER,Her Spirit's unabated youth
1322,MY MOTHER,Is aye to me
1323,MY MOTHER,The mind-compelling truth
1324,MY MOTHER,Of Immortality.
1325,MY MOTHER,"Her voice is, as it were,"
1326,MY MOTHER,"A silver dulcimer,"
1327,MY MOTHER,Tuned like the seraph's lays
1328,MY MOTHER,Eternally to praise.
1329,MY MOTHER,The blessings of Christ's chosen friends
1330,MY MOTHER,"Are doubly hers, whose mind,"
1331,MY MOTHER,"To charity inclined,"
1332,MY MOTHER,No selfish ends
1333,MY MOTHER,Have ever for an instant moved:

1353,HER INFLUENCE,
1354,HER INFLUENCE,"In evening's calm when in the quiet skies,"

1358,HER INFLUENCE,"That deeper hour when Night with Dawn is blent,"
1359,HER INFLUENCE,"And Silence stirs, its languors well-nigh spent,"
1360,HER INFLUENCE,I hear her gently sigh with sweet content.
1361,HER INFLUENCE,
1362,HER INFLUENCE,I hear young children laughing in the street:
1363,HER INFLUENCE,"Catch rays of sunshine from them as we meet,"

1431,(AFTER ANACREON),And bore a little bow and arrow.

1437,(AFTER ANACREON),With threats to carry him away.
1438,(AFTER ANACREON),
1439,(AFTER ANACREON),"The sport he took in such ill part,"
1440,(AFTER ANACREON),He stuck an arrow in my heart.
