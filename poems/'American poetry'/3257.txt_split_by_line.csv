114,INDEX.,The Weed.
115,INDEX.,
116,INDEX.,
117,INDEX.,A WEED is but an unloved flower!
118,INDEX.,"Go dig, and prune, and guide, and wait,"
119,INDEX.,"Until it learns its high estate,"
120,INDEX.,And glorifies some bower.

133,INDEX.,
134,INDEX.,
135,INDEX.,WHO is the strong?  Not he who puts to test

137,INDEX.,"But he who dwells where weaklings congregate,"
138,INDEX.,And never lets his splendid strength abate.
139,INDEX.,
140,INDEX.,Who is the good?  Not he who walks each day
141,INDEX.,"With moral men along the high, clean way;"
142,INDEX.,"But he who jostles gilded sin and shame,"

144,INDEX.,
145,INDEX.,Who is the wise?  Not he who from the start
146,INDEX.,With Wisdom’s followers has taken part;
147,INDEX.,"But he who looks in Folly’s tempting eyes,"
148,INDEX.,"And turns away, perceiving her disguise."
149,INDEX.,
150,INDEX.,"Who is serene?  Not he who flees his kind,"

177,INDEX.,
178,INDEX.,
179,INDEX.,The Chosen.
180,INDEX.,
181,INDEX.,
182,INDEX.,THEY stood before the Angel at the gate;
183,INDEX.,The Angel asked: “Why should you enter in?”
184,INDEX.,One said: “On earth my place was high and great;”
185,INDEX.,And one: “I warned my fellow-men from sin;”
186,INDEX.,Another: “I was teacher of the faith;
187,INDEX.,I scorned my life and lived in love with death.”
188,INDEX.,
189,INDEX.,And one stood silent.  “Speak!” the Angel said;
190,INDEX.,“What earthly deed has sent you here today?”
191,INDEX.,"“Alas!  I did but follow where they led,”"
192,INDEX.,He answered sadly: “I had lost my way—
193,INDEX.,"So new the country, and so strange my flight;"
194,INDEX.,I only sought for guidance and for light.”
195,INDEX.,
196,INDEX.,"“You have no passport?”  “None,” the answer came."
197,INDEX.,"“I loved the earth, tho’ lowly was my lot."
198,INDEX.,"I strove to keep my record free from blame,"
199,INDEX.,And make a heaven about my humble spot.
200,INDEX.,"A narrow life; I see it now, too late;"
201,INDEX.,"So, Angel, drive me from the heavenly gate.”"
202,INDEX.,
203,INDEX.,"The Angel swung the portal wide and free,"
204,INDEX.,And took the sorrowing stranger by the hand.
205,INDEX.,"“Nay, you alone,” he said, “shall come with me,"
206,INDEX.,Of all this waiting and insistent band.
207,INDEX.,"Of what God gave, you built your paradise;"
208,INDEX.,Behold your mansion waiting in the skies.”
209,INDEX.,
210,INDEX.,
211,INDEX.,
212,INDEX.,
213,INDEX.,The Nameless.
214,INDEX.,
215,INDEX.,
216,INDEX.,UNNUMBERED gods may unremembered die;
217,INDEX.,A thousand creeds may perish and pass by;
218,INDEX.,Yet do I lift mine eyes to ONE on high.
219,INDEX.,
220,INDEX.,Unnamed be HE from whom creation came;
221,INDEX.,There is no word whereby to speak His name
222,INDEX.,But petty men have mouthed it into shame.
223,INDEX.,
224,INDEX.,"I lift mine eyes, and with a river’s force"
225,INDEX.,My love’s full tide goes sweeping on its course
226,INDEX.,To that supreme and all embracing Source.
227,INDEX.,
228,INDEX.,Then back through all those thirsting channels roll
229,INDEX.,The mighty billows of the Over Soul.
230,INDEX.,"And I am He, the portion and the Whole."
231,INDEX.,
232,INDEX.,"As little streams before the flood tide flee,"
233,INDEX.,"As rivers vanish to become the sea,"
234,INDEX.,"The I exists no more, for I AM HE."
235,INDEX.,
236,INDEX.,
237,INDEX.,
238,INDEX.,
239,INDEX.,The Word.
240,INDEX.,
241,INDEX.,
242,INDEX.,"OH, a word is a gem, or a stone, or a song,"
243,INDEX.,"Or a flame, or a two-edged sword;"
244,INDEX.,"Or a rose in bloom, or a sweet perfume,"
245,INDEX.,"Or a drop of gall, is a word."
246,INDEX.,
247,INDEX.,"You may choose your word like a connoisseur,"
248,INDEX.,"And polish it up with art,"
249,INDEX.,"But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays,"
250,INDEX.,Is the word that comes from the heart.
251,INDEX.,
252,INDEX.,"You may work on your word a thousand weeks,"
253,INDEX.,But it will not glow like one
254,INDEX.,"That all unsought, leaps forth white hot,"
255,INDEX.,When the fountains of feeling run.
256,INDEX.,
257,INDEX.,"You may hammer away on the anvil of thought,"
258,INDEX.,"And fashion your word with care,"
259,INDEX.,"But unless you are stirred to the depths, that word"
260,INDEX.,Shall die on the empty air.
261,INDEX.,
262,INDEX.,"For the word that comes from the brain alone,"
263,INDEX.,Alone to the brain will speed;
264,INDEX.,"But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays,"
265,INDEX.,Oh! that is the word men heed.
266,INDEX.,
267,INDEX.,
268,INDEX.,
269,INDEX.,
270,INDEX.,Assistance.
271,INDEX.,
272,INDEX.,
273,INDEX.,"LEAN on no mortal, Love, and serve;"
274,INDEX.,"(For service is love’s complement),"
275,INDEX.,"But it was never God’s intent,"
276,INDEX.,"Your spirit from its path should swerve,"
277,INDEX.,To gain another’s point of view.
278,INDEX.,"As well might Jupiter, or Mars"
279,INDEX.,"Go seeking help from other stars,"
280,INDEX.,"Instead of sweeping ON, as you."
281,INDEX.,Look to the Great Eternal Cause
282,INDEX.,"And not to any man, for light."
283,INDEX.,"Look in; and learn the wrong, and right,"
284,INDEX.,From your own soul’s unwritten laws.
285,INDEX.,"And when you question, or demur,"

293,INDEX.,
294,INDEX.,"IF fallacies, come knocking at my door,"
295,INDEX.,"I’d rather feed, and shelter full a score,"
296,INDEX.,"Than hide behind the black portcullis, doubt,"
297,INDEX.,And run the risk of barring one Truth out.
298,INDEX.,
299,INDEX.,"And if pretention for a time deceive,"
300,INDEX.,"And prove me one too ready to believe,"
301,INDEX.,"Far less my shame, than if by stubborn act,"
302,INDEX.,"I brand as lie, some great colossal Fact."
303,INDEX.,
304,INDEX.,"On my soul’s door, the latch-string hangs outside;"
305,INDEX.,"Within, the lighted candle.  Let me guide"
306,INDEX.,"Some errant follies, on their wandering way,"
307,INDEX.,"Rather, than Wisdom give no welcoming ray."
308,INDEX.,
309,INDEX.,
310,INDEX.,
311,INDEX.,
312,INDEX.,Consciousness.
313,INDEX.,
314,INDEX.,
315,INDEX.,"GOD, what a glory, is this consciousness,"
316,INDEX.,"Of life on life, that comes to those who seek!"
317,INDEX.,"Nor would I, if I might, to others speak,"
318,INDEX.,"The fullness of that knowledge.  It can bless,"
319,INDEX.,"Only the eager souls, that willing, press"
320,INDEX.,"Along the mountain passes, to the peak."
321,INDEX.,"Not to the dull, the doubting, or the weak,"
322,INDEX.,"Will Truth explain, or Mystery confess."
323,INDEX.,
324,INDEX.,Not to the curious or impatient soul
325,INDEX.,"That in the start, demands the end be shown,"
326,INDEX.,"And at each step, stops waiting for a sign;"
327,INDEX.,"But to the tireless toiler toward the goal,"
328,INDEX.,Shall the great miracles of God be known
329,INDEX.,"And life revealed, immortal and divine."

334,INDEX.,The Structure.
335,INDEX.,
336,INDEX.,
337,INDEX.,UPON the wreckage of thy yesterday
338,INDEX.,Design the structure of tomorrow.  Lay
339,INDEX.,"Strong corner stones of purpose, and prepare"
340,INDEX.,"Great blocks of wisdom, cut from past despair."
341,INDEX.,"Shape mighty pillars of resolve, to set"
342,INDEX.,Deep in the tear-wet mortar of regret.

383,INDEX.,
384,INDEX.,WOULD you believe in Presences Unseen—
385,INDEX.,In life beyond this earthly life?  BE STILL:

387,INDEX.,Of silence at the portal of your will.
388,INDEX.,"Relax, and let the world go by unheard."
389,INDEX.,And seal your lips with some all-sacred word.
