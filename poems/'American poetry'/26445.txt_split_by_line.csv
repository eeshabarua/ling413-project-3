55,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,
56,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now"
57,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Is brooding, like a gentle spirit o'er"
58,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds
59,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,The bell's deep tones are swelling; 'tis the knell
60,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Of the departed year. No funeral train
61,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Is sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,"
62,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest"
63,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,"
64,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"As by a mourner's sigh; and, on yon cloud,"
65,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"That floats so still and placidly through heaven,"
66,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,The spirits of the Seasons seem to stand.
67,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,"
68,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And Winter with its aged locks--and breathe
69,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"In mournful cadences, that come abroad,"
70,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Like the far windharps wild, touching wail,"
71,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,"
72,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Gone from the earth forever.
73,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,
74,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,'Tis a time
75,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"For memory and for tears. Within the deep,"
76,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Still chambers of the heart, a spectre dim,"
77,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Whose tones are like the wizard voice of time,"
78,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold"
79,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And solemn finger to the beautiful
80,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"And holy visions, that have passed away,"
81,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And left no shadow of their loveliness
82,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,On the dead waste of life. The spectre lifts
83,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"The coffin-lid of Hope and Joy and Love,"
84,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"And bending mournfully above the pale,"
85,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers"
86,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,O'er what has passed to nothingness.
87,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,
88,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,The year
89,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng"
90,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,"
91,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course,"
92,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,It waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful;
93,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And they are not. It laid its pallid hand
94,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Upon the strong man: and the haughty form
95,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim."
96,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged"
97,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,The bright and joyous; and the tearful wail
98,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song"
99,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And reckless shout resounded. It passed o'er
100,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"The battle plain, where sword, and spear and shield,"
101,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Flashed in the light of midday; and the strength
102,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,"
103,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Green from the soil of carnage, waves above"
104,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"The crushed and mouldering skeleton. It came,"
105,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;
106,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,"
107,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"It heralded its millions to their home,"
108,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,In the dim land of dreams.
109,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,
110,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Remorseless time!
111,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power
112,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Can stay him in his silent course, or melt"
113,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"His iron heart to pity! On, still on,"
114,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"He presses and forever. The proud bird,"
115,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"The Condor of the Andes, that can soar"
116,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave"
117,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"The fury of the northing hurricane,"
118,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And bath its plumage in the thunder's home
119,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Furls his broad wing at nightfall, and sinks down"
120,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,To rest upon his mountain crag; but Time
121,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,"
122,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,And Night's deep darkness has no chain to bind
123,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,His rushing pinion.
124,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,
125,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Revolutions sweep
126,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast"
127,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink
128,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles
129,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back"
130,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear
131,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"To heaven their bold and blackened cliffs, and bow"
132,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Their tall heads to the plain; and empires rise,"
133,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,"
134,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"And rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,"
135,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Startling the nations; and the very stars,"
136,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Yon bright and glorious blazonry of God,"
137,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,"
138,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"And like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,"
139,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away"
140,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"To darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,"
141,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,"
142,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not"
143,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,"
144,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,"To sit and muse, like other conquerors,"
145,GEORGE D. PRENTICE.,Upon the fearful ruin he hath wrought.

156,HENRY TIMROD.,"Shall happy bells, from yonder ancient spire,"

158,HENRY TIMROD.,Round which the children play?

162,HENRY TIMROD.,How shall we grace the day?
163,HENRY TIMROD.,Ah! Let the thought that on this holy morn
164,HENRY TIMROD.,"The Prince of Peace-the Prince of Peace was born,"
165,HENRY TIMROD.,"Employ us, while we pray!"
166,HENRY TIMROD.,
167,HENRY TIMROD.,Pray for the peace which long
168,HENRY TIMROD.,"Hath left this tortured land, and haply now"
169,HENRY TIMROD.,"Holds its white court on some far mountain's brow,"
170,HENRY TIMROD.,There hardly safe from wrong!
171,HENRY TIMROD.,
172,HENRY TIMROD.,Let every sacred fane
173,HENRY TIMROD.,"Call its sad votaries to the shrine of God,"
174,HENRY TIMROD.,"And, with the cloister and the tented sod,"
175,HENRY TIMROD.,Join in one solemn strain!
176,HENRY TIMROD.,
177,HENRY TIMROD.,"He, who, till time shall cease,"
178,HENRY TIMROD.,"Will watch that earth, where once, not all in vain,"
179,HENRY TIMROD.,"He died to give us peace, may not disdain"
180,HENRY TIMROD.,A prayer whose theme is--peace.
181,HENRY TIMROD.,
182,HENRY TIMROD.,Perhaps ere yet the Spring
183,HENRY TIMROD.,"Hath died into the Summer, over all"
184,HENRY TIMROD.,"The land, the Peace of His vast love shall fall,"
185,HENRY TIMROD.,Like some protecting wing.
186,HENRY TIMROD.,
187,HENRY TIMROD.,"Oh, ponder what it means!"
188,HENRY TIMROD.,"Oh, turn the rapturous thought in every way!"
189,HENRY TIMROD.,"Oh, give the vision and the fancy play,"
190,HENRY TIMROD.,And shape the coming scenes!
191,HENRY TIMROD.,
192,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in the quiet dales,"
193,HENRY TIMROD.,"Made rankly fertile by the blood of men,"
194,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in the woodland, and the lonely glen,"
195,HENRY TIMROD.,Peace in the peopled vales!
196,HENRY TIMROD.,
197,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in the crowded town,"
198,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in the thousand fields of waving grain,"
199,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in the highway and the flowery lane,"
200,HENRY TIMROD.,Peace on the wind-swept down!
201,HENRY TIMROD.,
202,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace on the farthest seas,"
203,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace in our sheltered bays and ample streams,"
204,HENRY TIMROD.,Peace whereso'er our starry garland gleams;
205,HENRY TIMROD.,And peace in every breeze!
206,HENRY TIMROD.,
207,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace on the whirring marts,"
208,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace where the scholar thinks--the hunter roams,"
209,HENRY TIMROD.,"Peace, God of Peace! Peace, peace, in all our homes,"
210,HENRY TIMROD.,And peace in all our hearts!

223,HENRY TIMROD.,Is it because your sable hair
224,HENRY TIMROD.,Is folded over brows that wear
225,HENRY TIMROD.,At times a too imperial air;
226,HENRY TIMROD.,
227,HENRY TIMROD.,Or is it that the thoughts which rise
228,HENRY TIMROD.,In those dark orbs do seek disguise
229,HENRY TIMROD.,Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;
230,HENRY TIMROD.,
231,HENRY TIMROD.,That choose whatever pose or place
232,HENRY TIMROD.,"May chance to please, in you I trace"
233,HENRY TIMROD.,The noblest woman of your race?
234,HENRY TIMROD.,
235,HENRY TIMROD.,"The crowd is sauntering at its ease,"
236,HENRY TIMROD.,And humming like a hive of bees--
237,HENRY TIMROD.,You take your seat and touch the keys:
238,HENRY TIMROD.,
239,HENRY TIMROD.,I do not hear the giddy throng;
240,HENRY TIMROD.,"The sea avenges Israel's wrong,"
241,HENRY TIMROD.,And on the mind floats Miriam's song!
242,HENRY TIMROD.,
243,HENRY TIMROD.,You join me with a stately grace;
244,HENRY TIMROD.,Music to Poesy gives place;
245,HENRY TIMROD.,Some grand emotion lights your face:
246,HENRY TIMROD.,
247,HENRY TIMROD.,At once I stand by Mizpeh's walls;
248,HENRY TIMROD.,"With smiles the martyred daughter falls,"
249,HENRY TIMROD.,And desolate are Mizpeh's halls!
250,HENRY TIMROD.,
251,HENRY TIMROD.,Intrusive babblers come between;
252,HENRY TIMROD.,"With calm, pale brow and lofty mein,"
253,HENRY TIMROD.,You thread the circle like a queen!
254,HENRY TIMROD.,
255,HENRY TIMROD.,Then sweeps the royal Esther by;
256,HENRY TIMROD.,"The deep devotion in her eye,"
257,HENRY TIMROD.,"Is looking ""If I die, I die!"""
258,HENRY TIMROD.,
259,HENRY TIMROD.,You stroll the gardener's flowery walks;
260,HENRY TIMROD.,"The plants to me are grainless stalks,"
261,HENRY TIMROD.,And Ruth to old Naomi talks.
262,HENRY TIMROD.,
263,HENRY TIMROD.,"Adopted child of Judah's creed,"
264,HENRY TIMROD.,"Like Judah's daughters, true at need,"
265,HENRY TIMROD.,I see you mid the alien seed.
266,HENRY TIMROD.,
267,HENRY TIMROD.,I watch afar the gleaner sweet;
268,HENRY TIMROD.,"I watch like Boaz in the wheat,"
269,HENRY TIMROD.,And find you lying at my feet.
270,HENRY TIMROD.,
271,HENRY TIMROD.,"My feet! Oh! if the spell that lures,"

333,FATHER RYAN.,
334,FATHER RYAN.,Ah! Bethlehem was grander
