113,PROEM,"Pale, perfect, and immortal,"
114,PROEM,"The eternal visions are,"
115,PROEM,That never any rapture

117,PROEM,Of any song shall capture
118,PROEM,To dwell with men on earth.
119,PROEM,
120,PROEM,Many a strange and tragic
121,PROEM,Old sorrow still is mute
122,PROEM,And melodies of magic
123,PROEM,"Still slumber in the flute,"
124,PROEM,Many a mighty vision
125,PROEM,Has caught my yearning eye
126,PROEM,And swept with calm derision
127,PROEM,In robes of splendor by.
128,PROEM,
129,PROEM,The rushing susurration
130,PROEM,Of some eternal wing
131,PROEM,Beats mighty variation
132,PROEM,Through all the song I sing;
133,PROEM,"The vague, deep-mouthed commotion"
134,PROEM,From its ancestral home
135,PROEM,Booms like the shout of ocean
136,PROEM,Across the crumbling foam;
137,PROEM,And these low lyric whispers
138,PROEM,Make answer wistfully
139,PROEM,As sea-shells ... dreaming lispers
140,PROEM,Beside the eternal sea.

146,LAUS MARIÆ,
147,LAUS MARIÆ,There is a name like some deep melody
148,LAUS MARIÆ,"Hallowed by sundown, delicate as the plash"
149,LAUS MARIÆ,Of lonely waves on solitary lakes
150,LAUS MARIÆ,And rounded as the sudden-bursting bloom
151,LAUS MARIÆ,"Of bold, deep-throated notes in a midnight cloud"
152,LAUS MARIÆ,When shadowy belfries far away roll out
153,LAUS MARIÆ,Across the dark their avalanche of sound.
154,LAUS MARIÆ,
155,LAUS MARIÆ,It is a wild voice lost in the wail of the wind;
156,LAUS MARIÆ,The silvery-twinkling plectrum of the rain
157,LAUS MARIÆ,Plays in the poplar tree no other tune
158,LAUS MARIÆ,And pines intone it softly as a prayer
159,LAUS MARIÆ,In leafy litanies.
160,LAUS MARIÆ,The name is raised
161,LAUS MARIÆ,Even to God's ear from ancient arches dim
162,LAUS MARIÆ,With caverned twilight and dull altar smoke
163,LAUS MARIÆ,Where tapers weave athwart the azure haze
164,LAUS MARIÆ,Innumerable pageantries of dusk.
165,LAUS MARIÆ,
166,LAUS MARIÆ,Low-voiced and soft-eyed women must they live
167,LAUS MARIÆ,Who bear that holy name.  And now for one
168,LAUS MARIÆ,Time has no other honor than to be
169,LAUS MARIÆ,"The meaning of an unremembered rhyme,"
170,LAUS MARIÆ,The breath of a forgotten singer's song.

179,RECOLLECTION,I must forget awhile the mellow flutes
180,RECOLLECTION,And all the lyric wizardry of strings;
181,RECOLLECTION,"The fragile clarinet,"
182,RECOLLECTION,"Tremulous over meadows rich with dawn,"
183,RECOLLECTION,Must knock against my vagrant heart
184,RECOLLECTION,And throb and cry no more.
185,RECOLLECTION,
186,RECOLLECTION,For I am shaken by the loveliness
187,RECOLLECTION,And lights and laughter and beguiling song
188,RECOLLECTION,Of all this siren world;
189,RECOLLECTION,"The regal beauty of women, round on round,"
190,RECOLLECTION,"The swift, lithe slenderness of girls,"
191,RECOLLECTION,"And children's loyal eyes,"
192,RECOLLECTION,
193,RECOLLECTION,Hill rivers and the lilac fringe of seas
194,RECOLLECTION,"Lazily plunging, glow of city nights"
195,RECOLLECTION,And faces in the glow--
196,RECOLLECTION,"These things have stolen my heart away, I lie"
197,RECOLLECTION,"Parcelled abroad in sound and hue,"
198,RECOLLECTION,Dispersed through all I love.
199,RECOLLECTION,
200,RECOLLECTION,I must go far away to a still place
201,RECOLLECTION,And draw the shadows down across my eyes
202,RECOLLECTION,And wait and listen there
203,RECOLLECTION,"For wings vibrating from beyond the stars,"
204,RECOLLECTION,"Wide-ranging, swiftly winnowing wings"
205,RECOLLECTION,Bearing me back mine own.
206,RECOLLECTION,
207,RECOLLECTION,"So soon, now, I shall lie deep hidden away"
208,RECOLLECTION,"From sound or sight, with hearing strangely dull"
209,RECOLLECTION,"And heavy-lidded eyes,--"
210,RECOLLECTION,"'T is time, O passionate soul, for me to go"
211,RECOLLECTION,"Some far, hill-folded road apart"
212,RECOLLECTION,And learn the ways of peace.

219,NIGHTFALL,In a crumbling glory sets
220,NIGHTFALL,The unhastening sun;
221,NIGHTFALL,The fishers draw their shining nets;
222,NIGHTFALL,The day is done.
223,NIGHTFALL,
224,NIGHTFALL,Across the ruddy wine
225,NIGHTFALL,That brims the sea
226,NIGHTFALL,Black boats drag shoreward through the brine
227,NIGHTFALL,"Dreamily,"
228,NIGHTFALL,
229,NIGHTFALL,And dark against the glow
230,NIGHTFALL,"Firing the west,"
231,NIGHTFALL,By three and two the great gulls go
232,NIGHTFALL,Seaward to rest.
233,NIGHTFALL,
234,NIGHTFALL,Beneath the gradual host
235,NIGHTFALL,"Of heaven, pale"
236,NIGHTFALL,"And glimmering, rides a dim sea-ghost,"
237,NIGHTFALL,A large slow sail.
238,NIGHTFALL,
239,NIGHTFALL,Slowly she cometh on
240,NIGHTFALL,"Day's last faint breath,"
241,NIGHTFALL,"Drifting across the water, wan"
242,NIGHTFALL,And gray as death.
243,NIGHTFALL,
244,NIGHTFALL,From what far-lying land
245,NIGHTFALL,"Swimmeth thy keel,"
246,NIGHTFALL,Dim ship?  And what mysterious hand
247,NIGHTFALL,Is at thy wheel?
248,NIGHTFALL,
249,NIGHTFALL,What far-borne news for me?
250,NIGHTFALL,What vast release?
251,NIGHTFALL,"Quiet is in my heart, and on the sea"
252,NIGHTFALL,Peace.

259,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH
260,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
261,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"She winded on the castle horn,"
262,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"She clamored long and bold,"
263,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,For she was way-spent and forlorn
264,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And she was sore a-cold.
265,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
266,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And she stood lonely in the snow.
267,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Vague quiet filled the air....
268,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,From heaven's roof looked down aloof
269,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"The stars, with steady stare."
270,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
271,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,She heard the droning drift of snow
272,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And the wolf-wind on the hill....
273,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,No other sound....  For leagues around
274,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,The night was very still.
275,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
276,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"She cried aloud in sudden fright,"
277,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Open!  Warder ho!"
278,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Here is a pilgrim guest to-night
279,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Who can no farther go."""
280,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
281,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,The steady beat of mailed feet
282,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,In angry answer rang
283,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Along the floor.  The castle door
284,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Gave in with iron clang
285,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
286,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And the warder strode into his tower
287,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And saw her standing there
288,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Weary, like a storm-tossed flower,"
289,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"And, like an angel, fair."
290,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
291,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Here is no lodging for the night,"
292,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"No bread and wine for thee,"
293,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"No ingle bright, no warm firelight,"
294,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,No cheerful company.
295,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
296,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Here is no inn nor any kin"
297,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Of thine to harbor guest,"
298,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Nor thee to house will any rouse
299,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Out of his ancient rest."""
300,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
301,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Unearthly, dark, nocturnal things"
302,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,With faint and furtive stir
303,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Hovered on feather-muffled wings
304,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Round the fair face of her
305,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
306,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,As she made answer wearily:
307,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Ah! open now the gate."
308,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Though I was fleet with willing feet,"
309,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,I have come very late.
310,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
311,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Yea, though I came through flood and flame,"
312,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Through tempest, flood, and fire,"
313,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And left the wind to trail behind
314,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"The wings of my desire,"
315,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
316,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""And though I prayed the stars for aid"
317,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"And seas for wind and tide,"
318,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And though God gave me goodly pave
319,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"And ran, Himself, beside..."
320,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
321,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Aye, though my feet have been thus fleet,"
322,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Unto one heart, I know,"
323,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Whose sleep is still beneath the hill,"
324,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"My coming has been slow."""
325,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
326,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"And he bent gently down above,"
327,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,A soft light in his eye...
328,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Is not the holy name of Love"
329,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,The name men call thee by?
330,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
331,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Ah, Love, I know thee, for thy face"
332,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Is other-worldly fair;
333,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,A great light of some heavenly place
334,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Is on thy shining hair.
335,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
336,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""But thou, Love, who canst tread the stars,"
337,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Whose seat is by God's throne,"
338,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Why wilt thou bend thee to the dust
339,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And walk the dark alone?
340,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
341,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Thy ways are not our mortal ways."
342,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Hast thou nought else to do
343,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Than wander with thy dream-lit face
344,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Our glimmering darkness through?"""
345,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
346,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"But Love made answer, and her voice"
347,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Was as God's voice to him;
348,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,As tall and fair she towered there
349,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,As heavenly seraphim...
350,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,
351,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"""Open the gate! for Love shall dwell"
352,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,Even among the dead
353,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,And in the darkest deeps of hell!
354,A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH,"Open!  For God hath said!"""

360,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,
361,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"Dropping round and clear across the still miles,"
362,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"Ringing down the midnight's marble stair,"
363,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"A bird's cry is falling through the darkness,"
364,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Falling from the fields of upper air.
365,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,
366,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Through the rainy fragrance of the April night
367,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"Slow it falls, circling in the fall,"
368,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,And all the sheeted lake of sleeping silences
369,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Is troubled by the solitary call.
370,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,
371,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Each human heart awake knows the loneliness
372,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"Of that strange voice clear and far,"
373,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,"That lost voice searching through the midnight,"
374,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,That lonely star calling to a star.
375,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,
376,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Old memories are thronging through the darkness...
377,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,Slow tears are blinding sleepless eyes...
378,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,O lonely hearts remembering in the midnight!
379,BIRDS OF PASSAGE,O dark and empty skies!

384,WASTE,WASTE
385,WASTE,
386,WASTE,"Reluctant, groping fog crept gray and cold"
387,WASTE,Up from the fields where now the guns were still;
388,WASTE,Far off the thundering surge of battle rolled
389,WASTE,And darkness brooded on the quiet hill;
390,WASTE,"Clearly, across the listening night, the shrill"
391,WASTE,And rhythmic cry of a lonely cricket fell
392,WASTE,On ears long deafened by the scream of shot and shell.
393,WASTE,
394,WASTE,And there were two who listened wistfully
395,WASTE,"To that glad voice, that sad last voice of all,"
396,WASTE,Who on the morrow after reveille
397,WASTE,Would make no answer to the muster call;
398,WASTE,"Others would eat their mess, others would fall"
399,WASTE,"When the lines formed again into their places,"
400,WASTE,And soon their marching comrades would forget their faces.
401,WASTE,
402,WASTE,One moaned a little and the other turned
403,WASTE,"Painfully sidewise, peering up the bare"
404,WASTE,"Shell-furrowed slope.  Then, while his deep wound burned,"
405,WASTE,"He crawled, slow inch by weary inch, to where"
406,WASTE,"The boy lay,--young, he thought, and strangely fair."
407,WASTE,"""You see, I came,"" he said.  ""It was a wrench."
408,WASTE,I thought I'd die.  Let's have a light here.  What!  You're French!
409,WASTE,
410,WASTE,"""No matter ... we'll be going pretty soon..."
411,WASTE,"Dying 's a lonesome business at the best,"
412,WASTE,And when there's nothing but a ghastly moon
413,WASTE,"And fog for company, I lose my zest."
414,WASTE,There's a girl somewhere ... well... you know the rest.
415,WASTE,"I'm glad I came.  It's hand in hand now, brother."
416,WASTE,I think I laid you here.  I wish 't had been another.
417,WASTE,
418,WASTE,"""I never meant it, and you did n't mean"
419,WASTE,For me this ugly gash along my side.
420,WASTE,Something has pushed us on.  Our slate is clean.
421,WASTE,And long and long after we two have died
422,WASTE,Some learnedest of doctors will decide
423,WASTE,What thing it was.  But we ... we'll never know.
424,WASTE,Our business now 's to help make next year's harvest grow.
425,WASTE,
426,WASTE,"""You've been at school?  College de France!  You know"
427,WASTE,"Next year I should have heard your Bergson there,--"
428,WASTE,"Greatest since Hegel.  Think of Haeckel, though,"
429,WASTE,At my own Jena!  Mighty men they were.
430,WASTE,Not mighty enough for what they had to bear.
431,WASTE,"They read and wrote and taught, but you and I,"
432,WASTE,"How have we profited at last?  Well, here we lie."
433,WASTE,
434,WASTE,"""If I had known you by the silver Rhine,"
435,WASTE,"That dreamy country where I had my birth,"
436,WASTE,The land of golden corn and golden wine
437,WASTE,"And surely, I think, the world's most lovely earth,--"
438,WASTE,"I should have loved you, brother, and known your worth."
439,WASTE,But you were born beside the racing Rhone.
440,WASTE,"Ah, yes, that made the difference.  That thing alone."
441,WASTE,
442,WASTE,"""We might have fronted this world's stormy weather"
443,WASTE,Hand clasped in hand and seeing eye to eye.
444,WASTE,What was there we could not have done together?
445,WASTE,"Who dares to say we should have feared to die,"
446,WASTE,"Shoulder to shoulder standing, you and I?"
447,WASTE,"But now you are slain by me, your unknown friend."
448,WASTE,I die by your unknowing hand.  This ... this is the end!
449,WASTE,
450,WASTE,"""And all the love that might have been is blown"
451,WASTE,Far off like clouds that fade across the blue;
452,WASTE,"The game is over and the night shuts down,"
453,WASTE,Blotting the little dreams of me and you
454,WASTE,And all our hope of all we longed to do.
455,WASTE,"But courage, comrade!  It's not hard to die."
456,WASTE,"It's not so lonely now.  If only we know why!"""
457,WASTE,
458,WASTE,The fog-damp folded closer round the hill
459,WASTE,"And stillness deepened, but the cricket's song"
460,WASTE,Tore at the heavy hem of silence still--
461,WASTE,One small voice left of love in a world of wrong.
462,WASTE,A few dim stars looked down.  The yelling throng
463,WASTE,Of guns had passed beyond the mountain's brow
464,WASTE,"When once again he spoke, but slowly, faintlier now."
465,WASTE,
466,WASTE,"""Something discovered that it didn't need us--"
467,WASTE,Me in the Fatherland and you in France.
468,WASTE,"We were less worth than what it took to feed us,"
469,WASTE,And so life gave us only a little glance.
470,WASTE,It's true to say we never had a chance.
471,WASTE,"It's like this fog, around, above, below."
472,WASTE,"Reach out your hand to me.  Good-night.  We'll never know."""
473,WASTE,
474,WASTE,"And then they lay so still they seemed asleep,"
475,WASTE,For death was near and they had little pain.
476,WASTE,The midnight did not hear them moan or weep

1312,A CHAPEL BY THE SEA,Lulled by the lisping whisper of the eucalyptus tree
1313,A CHAPEL BY THE SEA,That shades my mountain chapel gazing out across the sea.

1323,EPHEMEROS,"""O lofty star, O streaming light,"
1324,EPHEMEROS,"Clear eye of heaven, immortal lamp"
1325,EPHEMEROS,"Set high above the dew and damp,"
1326,EPHEMEROS,Thou great high-priest to heaven's King
1327,EPHEMEROS,And chief of all the choirs that sing
1328,EPHEMEROS,"Their golden, endless antiphons"
1329,EPHEMEROS,Of praise before the eternal thrones--
1330,EPHEMEROS,Hear thou my prayer of worship!  Thine
1331,EPHEMEROS,"The glory, all the dimness mine."
1332,EPHEMEROS,I am a feeble glimmering spark
1333,EPHEMEROS,"Vagrant along the lower dark."""
1334,EPHEMEROS,
1335,EPHEMEROS,The star called down from heaven's roof
1336,EPHEMEROS,With a humble heart and mild reproof:
1337,EPHEMEROS,"""The Power that made, the Breath that blew"
1338,EPHEMEROS,My fire aglow has kindled you
1339,EPHEMEROS,With equal love and equal pain
1340,EPHEMEROS,And equal toil of heart and brain.
1341,EPHEMEROS,"For I am only a wandering light,"
1342,EPHEMEROS,Your elder comrade in the night.
1343,EPHEMEROS,"We are two sisters, you and I,"
1344,EPHEMEROS,And when we two burn out and die
1345,EPHEMEROS,It will be hardly known from far
1346,EPHEMEROS,"Which was the firefly, which the star."""

1355,WANDERLUST,The birds were beating north again with faint and starry cries
1356,WANDERLUST,"Along their ancient highway that spans the midnight skies,"
1357,WANDERLUST,"And out across the rush of wings my heart went crying too,"
1358,WANDERLUST,Straight for the morning's windy walls and lakes of misted blue.
1359,WANDERLUST,
1360,WANDERLUST,"They gave me place among them, for well they understood"
1361,WANDERLUST,"The magic wine of April working madness in my blood,"
1362,WANDERLUST,And we were kin in thought and dream as league by league together
1363,WANDERLUST,We kept that pace of straining wings across the starry weather.
1364,WANDERLUST,
1365,WANDERLUST,"The dim blue tides of Fundy, green slopes of Labrador"
1366,WANDERLUST,Slid under us ... our course was set for earth's remotest shore;
1367,WANDERLUST,But tingling through the ether and searching star by star
1368,WANDERLUST,A lonely voice went crying that drew me down from far.
1369,WANDERLUST,
1370,WANDERLUST,"Farewell, farewell, my brothers!  I see you far away"
1371,WANDERLUST,"Go drifting down the sunset across the last green bay,"

1382,THE IDEAL,"Serenely, from her mountain height sublime,"
1383,THE IDEAL,She mocks my hopeless labor as I creep
1384,THE IDEAL,Each day a day's strength farther from the deep
1385,THE IDEAL,And nearer to her side for which I climb.
1386,THE IDEAL,So may she mock when for the sad last time
1387,THE IDEAL,"I fall, my face still upward, upon sleep,"
1388,THE IDEAL,With faithful hands still yearning up the steep
1389,THE IDEAL,In patient and pathetic pantomime.
1390,THE IDEAL,
1391,THE IDEAL,"I am content, O ancient, young-eyed child"

1402,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1403,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,A little wandering wind went up the hill.
1404,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,It had a lonely voice as though it knew
1405,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,What it should find before it came to where
1406,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The broken body of him that had been Christ
1407,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Hung in the ruddy glow.  A bowshot down
1408,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The bleak rock-shouldered hill the soldiery
1409,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Had piled a fire, and when the searching wind"
1410,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Came stronger from the distant sea and dashed
1411,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The shadows and the gleam together, songs"
1412,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Of battle and lust were blown along the slope
1413,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Mingled with clash of swords on cuisse and shield.
1414,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,But of the women sitting by the cross
1415,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Even she whose life had been as gravely sweet
1416,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And sheltered as a lily's did not flinch.
1417,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Her face was buried in her shrouding cloak.
1418,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And she who knew too sorrowfully well
1419,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The cruelty and bitterness of life
1420,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Heard not.  She sat erect, her shadowy hair"
1421,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Blown back along the darkness and her eyes
1422,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,That searched the distant spaces of the night
1423,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Splendid and glowing with an inward joy.
1424,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And at the darkest hour came three or four
1425,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,From round the fire and would have driven them thence;
1426,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"But one who knew them, gazing in their eyes,"
1427,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Said: ""Nay.  It is his mother and his love,"
1428,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The scarlet Magdalena.  Let them be."""
1429,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"So, in the gloom beside that glimmering cross,"
1430,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Beneath the broken body of him they loved,"
1431,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,They wept and watched--the lily and the rose.
1432,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1433,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"At last the deep, low voice of Magdalen,"
1434,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Toned like a distant bell, broke on the hush:"
1435,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""We are so weak!  What can poor women do?"
1436,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,So pitifully frail!  God pity us!
1437,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,How he did pity us!  He understood...
1438,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Out of his own great strength he understood
1439,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,How it might feel to be so very weak...
1440,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"To be a tender lily of the field,"
1441,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,To be a lamb lost in the windy hills
1442,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Far from the fold and from the shepherd's voice,"
1443,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"To be a child with no strength, only love."
1444,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And ah, he knew, if ever a man can know,"
1445,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"What 't is to be a woman and to live,"
1446,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Strive how she may to out-soar and overcome,"
1447,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Tied to this too frail body of too fair earth!
1448,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1449,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""Oh, had I been a man to shield him then"
1450,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,In his great need with loving strong right arm!
1451,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,One of the twelve--ha!--of that noble twelve
1452,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"That ran away, and two made mock of him"
1453,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Or else betrayed him ere they ran?  Ah no!
1454,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And yet, a man's strength with a woman's love..."
1455,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"That might have served him somewhat ere the end."""
1456,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1457,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Then with a weary voice the mother said:
1458,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""What can we do but only watch and weep,"
1459,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Sit with weak hands and watch while strong men rend
1460,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And break and ruin, bringing all to nought"
1461,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The beauty we have nearly died to make?
1462,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1463,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""It is not true to say that he was strong."
1464,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"He did not claim the kingdom that was his,"
1465,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"He did not even seek for wealth and power,"
1466,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,He did not win a woman's love and get
1467,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Strong children to live after him, and all"
1468,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,That strong men strive for he passed heedless by.
1469,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Because that he was weak I loved him so...
1470,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"For that and for his soft and gentle ways,"
1471,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The tender patient calling of his voice
1472,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And that dear trick of smiling with his eyes.
1473,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Ah no!  I have had dreams--a mother's dreams--
1474,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,But now I cannot dream them any more.
1475,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1476,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""I sorrowed little as the happy days"
1477,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Sped by and by that still the fair-haired lad
1478,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Who lay at first beside me in the stall,"
1479,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The cattle stall outside Jerusalem,"
1480,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Found no great throne to dazzle his mother's eye.
1481,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,He was so good a workman ... axe and saw
1482,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Did surely suit him better than a sword.
1483,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,I was content if only he would wed
1484,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Some village girl of little Nazareth
1485,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And get me children with his own slow smile,"
1486,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Deep thoughtful eyes and golden kingly brow.
1487,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1488,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""It seems but yesterday he played among"
1489,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The shavings strewn on Joseph's work-shop floor.
1490,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The sunlight of the morning slanted through
1491,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The window--'t was in springtime--and across
1492,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The bench where Joseph sat, and then it lay"
1493,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,In golden glory on the boy's bright hair
1494,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And on the shavings that were golden too.
1495,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"I saw him through the open door.  I thought,"
1496,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,'My little king has found his golden crown.'
1497,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,But unto Joseph I said nought at all.
1498,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1499,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""But now, ah me! he won no woman's love,"
1500,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Nor loved one either as most men call love,"
1501,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And so he had no child and he is gone
1502,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And I am left without him and alone."""
1503,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1504,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,So by her son's pale broken body mourned
1505,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The mother, dreaming on departed days."
1506,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And as with one who looks into the west,"
1507,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Watching the embers of the outburned day
1508,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Crumble and cool and slowly droop and fade,"
1509,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And will not take the darkling eastward path
1510,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Where lies his way until the last faint glow
1511,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Has left the sky and the early stars shine forth,"
1512,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,So did her dream cling to the ruined past
1513,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And all the joy they had in Nazareth
1514,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Before the years of doubt and trouble came.
1515,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Then, while loud laughter sounded up the hill"
1516,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Where yet that ribald crew sang o'er the wine,"
1517,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,She bowed her head above her cradling arms
1518,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And softly sang, as to herself, the songs"
1519,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Of Israel that once had served her well
1520,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,To soothe the wakeful child.
1521,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1522,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,But Magdalen
1523,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Arose upon her feet and tossed her cloak
1524,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Back from the midnight of her wind-blown hair
1525,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And lifted up her eyes into the dark
1526,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"As though, beyond this circle of all our woe,"
1527,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,To read a hidden meaning in the stars.
1528,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1529,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""Aye, it is dark,"" she said.  ""The night comes on."
1530,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,He was the sunshine of our little day.
1531,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The clouds unsettled softly and we saw
1532,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Ladders of glory climbing into light
1533,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Unspeakable, with dazzling interchange"
1534,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Of Majesties and Powers.  But suddenly
1535,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The tides of darkness whelm us round again
1536,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And this drear dwindled earth becomes once more
1537,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,What it has ever been--a core of shade
1538,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And steaming vapor spinning in the dark,"
1539,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,A deeper clot of blackness in the void!
1540,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1541,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""The night comes on.  'T is hard to pierce the dark."
1542,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And if to me who loved him, whom he loved--"
1543,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Though well thou sayest, 'Not as most men call love'--"
1544,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Far harder will it be for those who hold
1545,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"In memory no gesture of his hand,"
1546,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"No haunting echo of his patient voice,"
1547,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Nor that dear trick of smiling with his eyes.
1548,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1549,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""O ceaseless tramp of armies down the years!"
1550,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,O maddened cries of 'Christ' and 'Son of Mary!'
1551,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,While o'er the crying screams the hurtling death....
1552,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Thou gentle shepherd of the quiet fold,"
1553,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Mild man of sorrows, hast thou done this thing,"
1554,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Who camest not to bring peace but a sword?
1555,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Ah no, not thou, but only our childishness,"
1556,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The pitifully childish heart of man
1557,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,That cannot learn and know beyond a little.
1558,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1559,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""The priests and captains and the little kings"
1560,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Will tear each other at the throat and cry:
1561,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"'Thus said he, lived he; swear it or thou diest!'"
1562,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,But these shall pass and perish in the dark
1563,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"While the lorn strays and outcasts of the world,"
1564,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The souls whose pain has seared their pride to dust
1565,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And burned a way for love to enter in--
1566,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,These only know his meaning and shall live.
1567,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1568,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""So is it as with one whose feet have trod"
1569,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The valley of the shadow, who has seen"
1570,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,His dearest lowered into endless night.
1571,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,All music holds for him a deeper strain
1572,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Of nobler meaning, and the flush of dawn,"
1573,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"High wind at noonday, crumbling sunset gold,"
1574,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And the dear pathetic look of children's eyes--
1575,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,All beauty pierces closer to his heart.
1576,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1577,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""Yea, thou thyself, pale youth upon the cross--"
1578,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The godlike strength of thee was rooted deep
1579,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"In human weakness.  Even she who bore thee,"
1580,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Seeing the man too nearly, missed the God,"
1581,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Erring as fits the mother.  Some will say
1582,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"In coming years, I feel it in my heart,"
1583,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"That thou didst face thy death a conscious God,"
1584,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Knowing almighty hands were stretched to snatch
1585,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And lift thee from the greedy clutching grave.
1586,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Falsely!  Forgetting dark Gethsemane,--"
1587,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Not knowing, as I know, what doubt assailed"
1588,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Thy human heart until the latest breath.
1589,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Ah, what a trumpery death, what mockery"
1590,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And mere theatric mimicry of pain,"
1591,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,If thou didst surely know thou couldst not die!
1592,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Thou didst not know.  And whether even now
1593,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Thy straying ghost, like some great moth of night"
1594,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Blown seaward through the shadow, flies and drifts"
1595,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Along dim coasts and headlands of the dark,"
1596,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"A homeless wanderer up and down the void,"
1597,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Or whether indeed thou art enthroned above
1598,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"In light and life, I know not.  This I know--"
1599,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,That in the moment of sheer certainty
1600,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,My soul will die.
1601,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1602,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""No!  On thy spirit lay"
1603,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,All the dark weight and mystery of pain
1604,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And all our human doubt and flickering hope,"
1605,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Deathless despairs and treasuries of tears,"
1606,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Gropings of spirit blindfold by the flesh
1607,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And grapplings with the fiend.  Else were thy death
1608,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Less like a God's than even mine may be.
1609,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1610,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"""Thou broken mother who canst see in him"
1611,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Only the quiet man, the needful child,"
1612,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And most of all the Babe of Bethlehem,"
1613,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Let it suffice thee.  Thy reward is great.
1614,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Who loveth God that never hath loved man?
1615,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Who knoweth man but cometh to know God?
1616,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Thou sacred, sorrowing mother, canst thou learn--"
1617,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Thou who hast gone so softly in God's sight--
1618,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Of me, the scarlet woman of old days?"
1619,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Come, let us talk together, thou and I."
1620,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Apart, we see him darkly, through a glass;"
1621,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Together, we shall surely see aright."
1622,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Bring thou thine innocence, thy stainless soul,"
1623,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And I will bring deep lore of suffering,"
1624,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,My dear-bought wisdom of defeat and pain.
1625,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"For out of these may come, believe it thou,"
1626,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Sanctities not like thine, but fit to bear"
1627,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,The bitter storms and whirlwinds of this world.
1628,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Aye, out of evil often springeth good,"
1629,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And sweetest honey from the lion's mouth.
1630,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And that he knew.  That very thing he meant
1631,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,When he withdrew me from the pits of shame.
1632,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,'T is I who see God shining through the man.
1633,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"I see the deity, the godlike strength"
1634,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,In his supreme capacity for pain.
1635,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Nor have I known the cruel love of men
1636,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,These many years to err when now I say
1637,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,This man loved not like men but like a God.
1638,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Thou broken mother, weep not for the child,"
1639,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Mourn not the man.  Acclaim the risen Christ!"""
1640,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1641,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"She turned and touched the other lovingly,"
1642,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Then stooped and peered into her darkened face.
1643,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"The mother slept, forspent and overborne"
1644,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,By weariness and woe too great to bear.
1645,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1646,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"She gently smiled.  ""So it is best,"" she said."
1647,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,
1648,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Tall and elate she stood, her shadowy hair"
1649,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Blown back along the darkness and her eyes
1650,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,That searched the distant spaces of the night
1651,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Splendid and glowing with an inward joy.
1652,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,And over that dark hill of tragedy
1653,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"And triumph, victory and dull despair,"
1654,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Over the sleeping Roman soldiery,"
1655,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Over the three stark crosses and the two
1656,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,"Who loved Him most, the lily and the rose,"
1657,THE FIRST CHRISTIAN,Shone still and clear the great compassionate stars.
