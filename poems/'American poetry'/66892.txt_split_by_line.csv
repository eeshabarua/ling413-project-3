143,THE PACIFIST,THE PACIFIST
144,THE PACIFIST,
145,THE PACIFIST,
146,THE PACIFIST,"In Ben’s blood there coursed the fire of the Celt,"
147,THE PACIFIST,A strain of the strong Saxon thew;
148,THE PACIFIST,From his eyes shot a glint of a son of the South――
149,THE PACIFIST,An American type through and through.
150,THE PACIFIST,"A dreamer, daredevil, and care free, they say,"
151,THE PACIFIST,"Who lived in the far remote past,――"
152,THE PACIFIST,An unpractical man and careless forsooth;
153,THE PACIFIST,Inclined as a youth to be fast.
154,THE PACIFIST,"He’d shot up the town and sowed some wild oats,"
155,THE PACIFIST,"And once on a time rolled the dice,"
156,THE PACIFIST,But heart like an ox and muscled like steel;
157,THE PACIFIST,"A dreamer? Yes, without price."
158,THE PACIFIST,"He filled no great niche in the town where he lived,"
159,THE PACIFIST,Was never considered worth while.
160,THE PACIFIST,The pacifist craft rolled their eyes to the sky
161,THE PACIFIST,"And mentioned his name with a smile,"
162,THE PACIFIST,"An odious smile, twixt a smirk and a grin,"
163,THE PACIFIST,A smile that was snaky and sly.
164,THE PACIFIST,"They’d ne’er draw a sword nor strike with a club,"
165,THE PACIFIST,But could damn with the lift of an eye.
166,THE PACIFIST,"The tocsin of war sounds at last in the land,"
167,THE PACIFIST,And threatened invasion seemed near.
168,THE PACIFIST,The hand of the patriot went to the sword;
169,THE PACIFIST,The pacifist muttered in fear;
170,THE PACIFIST,"He muttered, then sold to the Government, ground"
171,THE PACIFIST,"Down hard by the burden of Thor,"
172,THE PACIFIST,Life’s veriest needs at prohibitive rates;
173,THE PACIFIST,Conscription did curse and abhor.
174,THE PACIFIST,Ben rode to the front with the coming of strife
175,THE PACIFIST,Where the roar of the guns rose and fell;
176,THE PACIFIST,Was killed while he strove for democracy’s cause
177,THE PACIFIST,As he fought like a demon of hell.
178,THE PACIFIST,They builded a shaft in the town of his birth
179,THE PACIFIST,To the rascally skin and the beat
180,THE PACIFIST,"Who’d tricked Uncle Sam by short-changing of food,"
181,THE PACIFIST,A lynx-eyed and oily old cheat
182,THE PACIFIST,"Who yapped about honesty, horrors of war,"
183,THE PACIFIST,Contributed largely of speech
184,THE PACIFIST,And words of advice to the youth thereabouts――
185,THE PACIFIST,"His pacifist face was a ‘screech’,"
186,THE PACIFIST,Ben hadn’t a shaft where his forefathers slept
187,THE PACIFIST,Nor niche in the Chancel of Fame;
188,THE PACIFIST,"No tablet recited the list of his deeds,"
189,THE PACIFIST,Nor blazoned the worth of his name.
190,THE PACIFIST,He died as men do who answer the call
191,THE PACIFIST,With boots on and pierced to the heart;
192,THE PACIFIST,"He died and those lived who, sneering at him,"
193,THE PACIFIST,Sucked the people’s blood dry in the mart;
194,THE PACIFIST,"Conniving at profit, a pacifist brood,"
195,THE PACIFIST,Not unwilling a country to sell;
196,THE PACIFIST,"Iniquitous, plotting and pandering to pelf――"
197,THE PACIFIST,The opal-eyed vampires of hell!

205,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Said Eve to “hub” Adam:
206,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"“My dear, what’s the matter?"
207,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Your eyes are all bulging;
208,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Your teeth all a chatter.
209,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"That lump in your throat, dear,"
210,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Speak, Adam!” she muttered."
211,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"“Ad” gasped for his breath,"
212,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"And spluttered and spluttered,"
213,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Then breathed more at ease;
214,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Congestion releasing
215,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Its hold, he looked normal,"
216,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"But frowns his face creasing,"
217,“ADAM’S APPLE”,He paused before speaking:
218,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"“Eve, list while I chatter;"
219,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"I’ve most choked to death, see?"
220,“ADAM’S APPLE”,The cause of the matter
221,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Was eating your apple,"
222,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Esophagus cloying,"
223,“ADAM’S APPLE”,That Forbidden Fruit
224,“ADAM’S APPLE”,My life most destroying.”

228,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Now if we’re believing
229,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"In stuff that’s prenatal,"
230,“ADAM’S APPLE”,We plain see the reason
231,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Some “Ad’s” sons have fatal
232,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Big lumps all a bulging,"
233,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Their cervicals craning,――"
234,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"’Twas “Grandfather’s” fault,"
235,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"Heredity’s (s) training,"
236,“ADAM’S APPLE”,That lump in their throats just
237,“ADAM’S APPLE”,Keeps sticking and sticking.
238,“ADAM’S APPLE”,"“Adam’s Apple” Eve called it,"
239,“ADAM’S APPLE”,_But_ Eve did the picking.

245,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,
246,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,
247,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,There’s a quaint and care-free tavern
248,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"In the heart of business life,"
249,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"In the Quaker City’s centre,――"
250,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Where relaxation’s rife.
251,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,’Tis a melting pot and leveler
252,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"For the man who has a ‘bump’,"
253,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Or the one with trouble burdened
254,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Like a dromedary’s hump.
255,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,One finds parry and riposte rare
256,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Unto the nth degree,"
257,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"And Barney Bright, the Irish wight,"
258,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Who orders “darks” for me.
259,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Here Andrew Jackson Johnson,"
260,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Or MacDee, with _savoir faire_,"
261,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Smooths down the foolish talker
262,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Who wildly pounds the air.
263,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Now diplomatic “Jack” and “Mac”――
264,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"MacDee, I mean――the two"
265,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Have often smoothed the ruffled path
266,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,For you and me and you.
267,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Here rotund, pleasant Pickerel"
268,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Disports in ornate phrase,"
269,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,And Henry Schaffer ‘Gungha Dins:’
270,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Descants Bohemia’s ways
271,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Or “Colonel Massa” Hallowell,"
272,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Of famed blue-grass renown,"
273,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Exploits the perfect luxury
274,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Of bourbon trickling down.
275,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"And so, ad infinitum,"
276,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"From out the clouds of smoke,"
277,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Away from tribulation,"
278,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,We laugh and jest and joke.
279,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Now far as I have wandered,"
280,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"At home, abroad, afar,"
281,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,I’ve never seen the equal
282,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Of Bill MacDee’s cigar.
283,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Its shape just at the lighting
284,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Is like Zeppelin’s air craft;
285,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,’Tis round and rolled so nicely
286,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,And pointed fore and aft;
287,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"It faithfully interprets,"
288,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"In rising rings of smoke,"
289,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Each psychologic moment,"
290,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Each point and pass and poke.
291,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Now when it’s smooth and rounded
292,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Mac’s camping on the trail
293,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Of something that’s been mooted,"
294,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,And works his mental flail.
295,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,This cautious Scottish Quaker’s
296,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,“I see” means “I’ve a hunch”;
297,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,He’s sparring for an opening
298,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Before he hands a punch,"
299,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,But just before he counters
300,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"While listening to us “spar,”"
301,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,You will never see the equal
302,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Of good, old Mac’s cigar."
303,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,It’s whirled round like a cyclone;
304,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,It’s feathered like an owl;
305,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,It’s mussed up like a scrap can
306,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Or poor-plucked barnyard fowl.
307,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,It’s frayed and furred and serrate;
308,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,It’s toothed and torn and spurred;
309,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"It’s ripped and ribbed and ragged,"
310,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,And this is what’s occurred;
311,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Chaotic conversation
312,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"A figure needs, you know,"
313,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,A metaphor or something
314,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Interpreting its flow;
315,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"To visualize its looseness,"
316,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Its academic “punk”
317,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,From Literary Digests;
318,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,Its casuistic “bunk.”
319,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"And so when I’m relaxing,"
320,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"And talking wild and far,"
321,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,I catch my real reflection
322,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,In Bill MacDee’s cigar.
323,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"I trust that it may “_fumer_,”"
324,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"Frayed, frazzled old cheroot,"
325,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"For many years of joy for Mac,"
326,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,With other things to boot.
327,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,And when I’ve run my gamut
328,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,"And am “crossing of the bar,”"
329,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,I hope to see a-glowing
330,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,The end of Mac’s cigar.
331,MAC’S (PSYCHOLOGIC) CIGAR,

340,BREAKING IN,"I laid it down before him,"

342,BREAKING IN,"Some turn of conversation,"
343,BREAKING IN,"Some “jolly” or some speech,"
344,BREAKING IN,A sesame or something

347,BREAKING IN,Of sympathy and such
348,BREAKING IN,"Emotionals and interest,"
349,BREAKING IN,And volunteered this much:
350,BREAKING IN,“I feel I have a FUTURE
351,BREAKING IN,"In writing, don’t you see,"
352,BREAKING IN,In enlightening the public
353,BREAKING IN,With prose and poetry!”
354,BREAKING IN,I waited a few minutes
355,BREAKING IN,"Until the tale he’d read,"
356,BREAKING IN,He looked at me acutely
357,BREAKING IN,With horoscopic dread.
358,BREAKING IN,“You feel you have a FUTURE
359,BREAKING IN,"In writing, then,” he sneered."
360,BREAKING IN,"“You’d better get a PAST, sir,”"
361,BREAKING IN,Was all he volunteered.

414,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"“My friend, you will have to show me.”"
415,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"No cynical scoff nor ironical thrust,"
416,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"No skeptical look nor a sneer,"
417,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Just a leveling kind, “don’t throw a bluff” glance,"
418,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Then “welcome here without fear.”
419,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,The Poor Man’s Club hates the stuffed suit kind;
420,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,I opine it dislikes the “know
421,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"It all” sort, the artistically weird,"
422,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Still more it detests the blow.
423,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"It ignores the sycophant’s sly, smooth tricks"
424,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,And the man who tries to droll.
425,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"It shunts a cold, climbing, cynical cad"
426,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,As it would a plain damned fool.
427,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,In short it’s a sane sort of potpourri
428,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Or a melting pot, you know,"
429,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"For “high brow,” “low brow,” no brows at all,"
430,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Or flotsam who just come and go.
431,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Yes, the Poor Man’s Club is a leveling place"
432,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,For the man with mental bumps.
433,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Its light and cheer are just the best boost
434,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,For the one who’s in the dumps.
435,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Life’s edges rough with a deft, tactful touch,"
436,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"It smooths for the man who’s down,"
437,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,And the one who’s up never tries the snide trick
438,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Of a patronizing frown.
439,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,So if some night you are all out of sorts
440,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"And don’t know what to do,"
441,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Why just drop in to the Poor Man’s Club,"
442,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,And let me present to you
443,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"First “Jack” and “Mac,” then old “Skeff” and “Lope”"
444,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"And “Jawn” and rare “Doc” and “Bill,”"
445,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"Also “Mont” and “Cook,” or some “also ran brows,”"
446,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,And then you can have your fill
447,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,Of talk that’s light and a good heartening up
448,THE POOR MAN’S CLUB,"And kindly repartee,"

765,JUMBO’S DREAM,He looked them over with kindly eye

773,JUMBO’S DREAM,He straightway appointed of parrots five

775,JUMBO’S DREAM,To start off their college so grand and fine
776,JUMBO’S DREAM,In eighteen hundred and ninety-nine.
777,JUMBO’S DREAM,The parrot committee composed a cheer;
778,JUMBO’S DREAM,"It went exactly like this, my dear:"

785,JUMBO’S DREAM,"A terrible, fearfully mixed-up noise,"
786,JUMBO’S DREAM,"Fifty times worse than the college boys,"
787,JUMBO’S DREAM,For the snake would hiss and the monkeys squeal;
788,JUMBO’S DREAM,The lion would roar till one could feel
789,JUMBO’S DREAM,The ground all tremble from noise he made
790,JUMBO’S DREAM,Like soldiers marching on dress parade;
791,JUMBO’S DREAM,The hyena let out such a mighty yell
792,JUMBO’S DREAM,That the leaves most off the branches fell;
