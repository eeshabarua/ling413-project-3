128,SONNETS.,"EMMA LAZARUS. (Written for ""The Century Magazine"")"
129,SONNETS.,
130,SONNETS.,"Born July 22, 1849; Died November 19, 1887."
131,SONNETS.,
132,SONNETS.,
133,SONNETS.,One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life so hidden
134,SONNETS.,and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus; but while her
135,SONNETS.,"memory is fresh, and the echo of her songs still lingers in these pages,"
136,SONNETS.,"we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more, and to note the"
137,SONNETS.,traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before
138,SONNETS.,the world. Of dramatic episode or climax in her life there is none;
139,SONNETS.,"outwardly all was placid and serene, like an untroubled stream whose"
140,SONNETS.,"depths alone hold the strong, quick tide. The story of her life is the"
141,SONNETS.,"story of a mind, of a spirit, ever seeking, ever striving, and pressing"
142,SONNETS.,onward and upward to new truth and light. Her works are the mirror of
143,SONNETS.,"this progress. In reviewing them, the first point that strikes us is the"
144,SONNETS.,"precocity, or rather the spontaneity, of her poetic gift. She was a born"
145,SONNETS.,"singer; poetry was her natural language, and to write was less effort"
146,SONNETS.,"than to speak, for she was a shy, sensitive child, with strange reserves"
147,SONNETS.,"and reticences, not easily putting herself ""en rapport"" with those"
148,SONNETS.,around her. Books were her world from her earliest years; in them she
149,SONNETS.,literally lost and found herself. She was eleven years old when the War
150,SONNETS.,"of Succession broke out, which inspired her first lyric outbursts."
151,SONNETS.,Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen and
152,SONNETS.,"seventeen were collected, and constituted her first published volume."
153,SONNETS.,"Crude and immature as these productions naturally were, and utterly"
154,SONNETS.,"condemned by the writer's later judgment, they are, nevertheless, highly"
155,SONNETS.,"interesting and characteristic, giving, as they do, the keynote of"
156,SONNETS.,much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life. One cannot fail to
157,SONNETS.,be rather painfully impressed by the profound melancholy pervading
158,SONNETS.,"the book. The opening poem is ""In Memoriam,""--on the death of a school"
159,SONNETS.,friend and companion; and the two following poems also have death for
160,SONNETS.,"theme. ""On a Lock of my Mother's Hair"" gives us reflections on growing"
161,SONNETS.,old. These are the four poems written at the age of fourteen. There is
162,SONNETS.,"not a wholly glad and joyous strain in the volume, and we might smile"
163,SONNETS.,"at the recurrence of broken vows, broken hearts, and broken lives in the"
164,SONNETS.,"experience of this maiden just entered upon her teens, were it not"
165,SONNETS.,that the innocent child herself is in such deadly earnest. The two long
166,SONNETS.,"narrative poems, ""Bertha"" and ""Elfrida,"" are tragic in the extreme. Both"
167,SONNETS.,"are dashed off apparently at white heat: ""Elfrida,"" over fifteen hundred"
168,SONNETS.,"lines of blank verse, in two weeks; ""Bertha,"" in three and a half. We"
169,SONNETS.,"have said that Emma Lazarus was a born singer, but she did not sing,"
170,SONNETS.,"like a bird, for joy of being alive; and of being young, alas! there is"
171,SONNETS.,"no hint in these youthful effusions, except inasmuch as this unrelieved"
172,SONNETS.,"gloom, this ignorance of ""values,"" so to speak, is a sign of youth,"
173,SONNETS.,common especially among gifted persons of acute and premature
174,SONNETS.,"sensibilities, whose imagination, not yet focused by reality,"
175,SONNETS.,"overreached the mark. With Emma Lazarus, however, this sombre streak has"
176,SONNETS.,a deeper root; something of birth and temperament is in it--the stamp
177,SONNETS.,and heritage of a race born to suffer. But dominant and fundamental
178,SONNETS.,"though it was, Hebraism was only latent thus far. It was classic"
179,SONNETS.,and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her. She pictures
180,SONNETS.,"Aphrodite the beautiful, arising from the waves, and the beautiful"
181,SONNETS.,"Apollo and his loves,--Daphne, pursued by the god, changing into the"
182,SONNETS.,"laurel, and the enamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower. Beauty, for"
183,SONNETS.,"its own sake, supreme and unconditional, charmed her primarily and"
184,SONNETS.,"to the end. Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea,--the"
185,SONNETS.,"absolute unity and identity of man with nature, as symbolized in the"
186,SONNETS.,"Greek myths, where every natural force becomes a person, and where, in"
187,SONNETS.,"turn, persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature"
188,SONNETS.,again.
189,SONNETS.,
190,SONNETS.,In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not
191,SONNETS.,"appear,--Heine, the Greek, Heine the Jew, Heine the Romanticist, as Emma"
192,SONNETS.,Lazarus herself has styled him; and already in this early volume of hers
193,SONNETS.,we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards so plainly
194,SONNETS.,declared itself. Foremost among the translations are a number of
195,SONNETS.,"his songs, rendered with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely"
196,SONNETS.,"combined. Four years later, at the age of twenty-one, she published her"
197,SONNETS.,"second volume, ""Admetus and Other Poems,"" which at once took rank as"
198,SONNETS.,"literature both in America and England, and challenged comparison with"
199,SONNETS.,"the work of established writers. Of classic themes we have ""Admetus"" and"
200,SONNETS.,"""Orpheus,"" and of romantic the legend of Tannhauser and of the saintly"
201,SONNETS.,Lohengrin. All are treated with an artistic finish that shows perfect
202,SONNETS.,"mastery of her craft, without detracting from the freshness and flow of"
203,SONNETS.,"her inspiration. While sounding no absolutely new note in the world,"
204,SONNETS.,"she yet makes us aware of a talent of unusual distinction, and a highly"
205,SONNETS.,"endowed nature,--a sort of tact of sentiment and expression, an instinct"
206,SONNETS.,"of the true and beautiful, and that quick intuition which is like"
207,SONNETS.,second-sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external
208,SONNETS.,stimulus. But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volume that
209,SONNETS.,most deeply interest us. We come upon experience of life in these pages;
210,SONNETS.,"not in the ordinary sense, however, of outward activity and movement,"
211,SONNETS.,"but in the hidden undercurrent of being. ""The epochs of our life are not"
212,SONNETS.,"in the visible facts, but in the silent thoughts by the wayside as we"
213,SONNETS.,"walk."" This is the motto, drawn from Emerson, which she chooses for her"
214,SONNETS.,"poem of ""Epochs,"" which marks a pivotal moment in her life. Difficult"
215,SONNETS.,"to analyze, difficult above all to convey, if we would not encroach"
216,SONNETS.,"upon the domain of private and personal experience, is the drift of"
217,SONNETS.,"this poem, or rather cycle of poems, that ring throughout with a deeper"
218,SONNETS.,accent and a more direct appeal than has yet made itself felt. It is the
219,SONNETS.,"drama of the human soul,--""the mystic winged and flickering butterfly,"""
220,SONNETS.,"""flitting between earth and sky,"" in its passage from birth to death."
221,SONNETS.,
222,SONNETS.,"A golden morning of June! ""Sweet empty sky without a stain."" Sunlight"
223,SONNETS.,"and mist and ""ripple of rain-fed rills."" ""A murmur and a singing"
224,SONNETS.,"manifold."""
225,SONNETS.,
226,SONNETS.,
227,SONNETS.,"""What simple things be these the soul to raise"
228,SONNETS.,"To bounding joy, and make young pulses beat"
229,SONNETS.,"With nameless pleasure, finding life so sweet!"""
230,SONNETS.,
231,SONNETS.,
232,SONNETS.,"Such is youth, a June day, fair and fresh and tender with dreams and"
233,SONNETS.,"longing and vague desire. The morn lingers and passes, but the noon has"
234,SONNETS.,"not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise, the sunshine"
235,SONNETS.,"dies, the air grows thick and heavy, the lightnings flash, the thunder"
236,SONNETS.,"breaks among the hills, rolls and gathers and grows, until"
237,SONNETS.,
238,SONNETS.,
239,SONNETS.,"Behold, yon bolt struck home,"
240,SONNETS.,"And over ruined fields the storm hath come."""
241,SONNETS.,
242,SONNETS.,
243,SONNETS.,"Now we have the phases of the soul,--the shock and surprise of grief in"
244,SONNETS.,"the face of the world made desolate. Loneliness and despair for a space,"
245,SONNETS.,"and then, like stars in the night, the new births of the spirit, the"
246,SONNETS.,wonderful outcoming from sorrow: the mild light of patience at first;
247,SONNETS.,hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil; the new meaning
248,SONNETS.,"and worth of life beyond sorrow, beyond joy; and finally duty, the"
249,SONNETS.,"holiest word of all, that leads at last to victory and peace. The poem"
250,SONNETS.,"rounds and completes itself with the close of ""the long, rich day,"" and"
251,SONNETS.,the release of
252,SONNETS.,
253,SONNETS.,
254,SONNETS.,"""The mystic winged and flickering butterfly,"
255,SONNETS.,"A human soul, that drifts at liberty,"
256,SONNETS.,"Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise,"
257,SONNETS.,"To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies!"""
258,SONNETS.,
259,SONNETS.,
260,SONNETS.,"We have dwelt at some length upon this poem, which seems to us, in a"
261,SONNETS.,"certain sense, subjective and biographical; but upon closer analysis"
262,SONNETS.,"there is still another conclusion to arrive at. In ""Epochs"" we have,"
263,SONNETS.,"doubtless, the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer,"
264,SONNETS.,"and profoundly working upon her sensibilities; not however by direct,"
265,SONNETS.,"but reflex action, as it were, and through sympathetic emotion--the"
266,SONNETS.,"emotion of the deeply-stirred spectator, of the artist, the poet who"
267,SONNETS.,"lives in the lives of others, and makes their joys and their sorrows his"
268,SONNETS.,own.
269,SONNETS.,
270,SONNETS.,Before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to the
271,SONNETS.,"shaping of mind and character. The poem of ""Admetus"" is dedicated ""to"
272,SONNETS.,"my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson."" Emma Lazarus was between seventeen and"
273,SONNETS.,"eighteen years of age when the writings of Emerson fell into her hands,"
274,SONNETS.,and it would be difficult to over-estimate the impression produced upon
275,SONNETS.,"her. As she afterwards wrote: ""To how many thousand youthful hearts has"
276,SONNETS.,"not his word been the beacon--nay, more, the guiding star--that led them"
277,SONNETS.,"safely through periods of mental storm and struggle!"" Of no one is this"
278,SONNETS.,"more true than herself. Left, to a certain extent, without compass or"
279,SONNETS.,"guide, without any positive or effective religious training, this was"
280,SONNETS.,the first great moral revelation of her life. We can easily realize
281,SONNETS.,"the chaos and ferment of an over-stimulated brain, steeped in romantic"
282,SONNETS.,"literature, and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination."
283,SONNETS.,"Who can tell what is true, what is false, in a world where fantasy is as"
284,SONNETS.,"real as fact? Emerson's word fell like truth itself, ""a shaft of light"
285,SONNETS.,"shot from the zenith,"" a golden rule of thought and action. His books"
286,SONNETS.,"were bread and wine to her, and she absorbed them into her very being."
287,SONNETS.,"She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master, ""that fount of wisdom"
288,SONNETS.,"and goodness,"" and it was her great privilege during these years to be"
289,SONNETS.,brought into personal relations with him. From the first he showed her
290,SONNETS.,"a marked interest and sympathy, which became for her one of the most"
291,SONNETS.,valued possessions of her life. He criticised her work with the fine
292,SONNETS.,appreciation and discrimination that made him quick to discern the
293,SONNETS.,"quality of her talent as well as of her personality, and he was no doubt"
294,SONNETS.,"attracted by her almost transparent sincerity and singleness of soul, as"
295,SONNETS.,well as by the simplicity and modesty that would have been unusual even
296,SONNETS.,"in a person not gifted. He constituted himself, in a way, her literary"
297,SONNETS.,"mentor, advised her as to the books she should read and the attitude of"
298,SONNETS.,mind she should cultivate. For some years he corresponded with her very
299,SONNETS.,"faithfully; his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances,"
300,SONNETS.,and give evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and
301,SONNETS.,a high incentive. But encouragement even from so illustrious a source
302,SONNETS.,"failed to elate the young poetess, or even to give her a due sense of"
303,SONNETS.,"the importance and value of her work, or the dignity of her vocation."
304,SONNETS.,We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingness to
305,SONNETS.,"assert herself or claim any prerogative,--something even morbid"
306,SONNETS.,"and exaggerated, which we know not how to define, whether as over-"
307,SONNETS.,"sensitiveness or indifference. Once finished, the heat and glow of"
308,SONNETS.,"composition spent, her writings apparently ceased to interest her. She"
309,SONNETS.,"often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimate friends, and"
310,SONNETS.,the public verdict as to their excellence could not reassure or satisfy
311,SONNETS.,"her. The explanation is not far, perhaps, to seek. Was it not the"
312,SONNETS.,"""Ewig-Weibliche"" that allows no prestige but its own? Emma Lazarus was"
313,SONNETS.,"a true woman, too distinctly feminine to wish to be exceptional, or to"
314,SONNETS.,"stand alone and apart, even by virtue of superiority."
315,SONNETS.,
316,SONNETS.,A word now as to her life and surroundings. She was one of a family of
317,SONNETS.,"seven, and her parents were both living. Her winters were passed in"
318,SONNETS.,"New York, and her summers by the sea. In both places her life was"
319,SONNETS.,essentially quiet and retired. The success of her book had been mainly
320,SONNETS.,in the world of letters. In no wise tricked out to catch the public
321,SONNETS.,"eye, her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure, but were"
322,SONNETS.,destined slowly to take their proper place and give her the rank that
323,SONNETS.,she afterwards held.
324,SONNETS.,
325,SONNETS.,For some years now almost everything that she wrote was published in
326,SONNETS.,"""Lippincott's Magazine,"" then edited by John Foster Kirk, and we shall"
327,SONNETS.,still find in her poems the method and movement of her life. Nature
328,SONNETS.,"is still the fount and mirror, reflecting, and again reflected, in the"
329,SONNETS.,"soul. We have picture after picture, almost to satiety, until we grow"
330,SONNETS.,conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vital play to the
331,SONNETS.,"thought, as though the brain were spending itself in dreamings and"
332,SONNETS.,"reverie, the heart feeding upon itself, and the life choked by its"
333,SONNETS.,"own fullness without due outlet. Happily, however, the heavy cloud of"
334,SONNETS.,"sadness has lifted, and we feel the subsidence of waves after a storm."
335,SONNETS.,"She sings ""Matins:""--"
336,SONNETS.,
337,SONNETS.,
338,SONNETS.,"""Does not the morn break thus,"
339,SONNETS.,"Swift, bright, victorious,"
340,SONNETS.,With new skies cleared for us
341,SONNETS.,Over the soul storm-tost?
342,SONNETS.,"Her night was long and deep,"
343,SONNETS.,"Strange visions vexed her sleep,"
344,SONNETS.,"Strange sorrows bade her weep,"
345,SONNETS.,Her faith in dawn was lost.
346,SONNETS.,
347,SONNETS.,
348,SONNETS.,"""No halt, no rest for her,"
349,SONNETS.,The immortal wanderer
350,SONNETS.,From sphere to higher sphere
351,SONNETS.,Toward the pure source of day.
352,SONNETS.,"The new light shames her fears,"
353,SONNETS.,"Her faithlessness and tears,"
354,SONNETS.,As the new sun appears
355,SONNETS.,"To light her god-like way."""
356,SONNETS.,
357,SONNETS.,
358,SONNETS.,"Nature is the perpetual resource and consolation. ""'T is good to be"
359,SONNETS.,"alive!"" she says, and why? Simply,"
360,SONNETS.,
361,SONNETS.,
362,SONNETS.,"""To see the light"
363,SONNETS.,"That plays upon the grass, to feel (and sigh"
364,SONNETS.,With perfect pleasure) the mild breeze stir
365,SONNETS.,"Among the garden roses, red and white,"
366,SONNETS.,"With whiffs of fragrancy."""
367,SONNETS.,
368,SONNETS.,
369,SONNETS.,"She gives us the breath of the pines and of the cool, salt seas,"
370,SONNETS.,"""illimitably sparkling."" Her ears drink the ripple of the tide, and she"
371,SONNETS.,stops
372,SONNETS.,
373,SONNETS.,
374,SONNETS.,"""To gaze as one who is not satisfied"
375,SONNETS.,"With gazing at the large, bright, breathing sea."""
376,SONNETS.,
377,SONNETS.,
378,SONNETS.,"""Phantasies"" (after Robert Schumann) is the most complete and perfect"
379,SONNETS.,"poem of this period. Like ""Epochs,"" it is a cycle of poems, and the"
380,SONNETS.,"verse has caught the very trick of music,--alluring, baffling, and"
381,SONNETS.,"evasive. This time we have the landscape of the night, the glamour of"
382,SONNETS.,"moon and stars,--pictures half real and half unreal, mystic imaginings,"
383,SONNETS.,"fancies, dreams, and the enchantment of ""faerie,"" and throughout the"
384,SONNETS.,"unanswered cry, the eternal ""Wherefore"" of destiny. Dawn ends the song"
385,SONNETS.,"with a fine clear note, the return of day, night's misty phantoms"
386,SONNETS.,"rolled away, and the world itself, again green, sparkling and breathing"
387,SONNETS.,freshness.
388,SONNETS.,
389,SONNETS.,"In 1874 she published ""Alide,"" a romance in prose drawn from Goethe's"
390,SONNETS.,autobiography. It may be of interest to quote the letter she received
391,SONNETS.,from Tourgeneff on this occasion:--
392,SONNETS.,
393,SONNETS.,
394,SONNETS.,"""Although, generally speaking, I do not think it advisable"
395,SONNETS.,"to take celebrated men, especially poets and artists, as a"
396,SONNETS.,"subject for a novel, still I am truly glad to say that I"
397,SONNETS.,have read your book with the liveliest interest.  It is
398,SONNETS.,very sincere and very poetical at the same time; the life
399,SONNETS.,"and spirit of Germany have no secrets for you, and your"
400,SONNETS.,characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is
401,SONNETS.,strong.  I feel very proud of the approbation you give to
402,SONNETS.,"my works, and of the influence you kindly attribute to them"
403,SONNETS.,on your own talent; an author who write as you do is not
404,SONNETS.,a pupil in art any more; he is not far from being himself
405,SONNETS.,"a master."""
406,SONNETS.,
407,SONNETS.,
408,SONNETS.,"Charming and graceful words, of which the young writer was justly proud."
409,SONNETS.,
410,SONNETS.,"About this time occurred the death of her mother, the first break in the"
411,SONNETS.,"home and family circle. In August of 1876 she made a visit to Concord,"
412,SONNETS.,"at the Emersons', memorable enough for her to keep a journal and note"
413,SONNETS.,"down every incident and detail. Very touching to read now, in its almost"
414,SONNETS.,"childlike simplicity, is this record of ""persons that pass and shadows"
415,SONNETS.,"that remain."" Mr. Emerson himself meets her at the station, and drives"
416,SONNETS.,"with her in his little one-horse wagon to his home, the gray square"
417,SONNETS.,"house, with dark green blinds, set amidst noble trees. A glimpse of the"
418,SONNETS.,"family,--""the stately, white-haired Mrs. Emerson, and the beautiful,"
419,SONNETS.,"faithful Ellen, whose figure seems always to stand by the side of her"
420,SONNETS.,"august father."" Then the picture of Concord itself, lovely and smiling,"
421,SONNETS.,"with its quiet meadows, quiet slopes, and quietest of rivers. She meets"
422,SONNETS.,"the little set of Concord people: Mr. Alcott, for whom she does not"
423,SONNETS.,"share Mr. Emerson's enthusiasm; and William Ellery Channing, whose"
424,SONNETS.,"figure stands out like a gnarled and twisted scrub-oak,--a pathetic,"
425,SONNETS.,"impossible creature, whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on"
426,SONNETS.,"account of an innate nobility of character. ""Generally crabbed and"
427,SONNETS.,"reticent with strangers, he took a liking to me,"" says Emma Lazarus."
428,SONNETS.,"""The bond of our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau, whose memory he"
429,SONNETS.,"actually worships, having been his constant companion in his best"
430,SONNETS.,"days, and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroic"
431,SONNETS.,suffering. I do not know whether I was most touched by the thought of
432,SONNETS.,"the unique, lofty character that had inspired this depth and fervor of"
433,SONNETS.,"friendship, or by the pathetic constancy and pure affection of the poor,"
434,SONNETS.,"desolate old man before me, who tried to conceal his tenderness and"
435,SONNETS.,sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness and philosophy. He
436,SONNETS.,"never speaks of Thoreau's death,"" she says, ""but always 'Thoreau's"
437,SONNETS.,"loss,' or 'when I lost Mr. Thoreau,' or 'when Mr. Thoreau went away from"
438,SONNETS.,"Concord;' nor would he confess that he missed him, for there was not a"
439,SONNETS.,"day, an hour, a moment, when he did not feel that his friend was still"
440,SONNETS.,"with him and had never left him. And yet a day or two after,"" she goes"
441,SONNETS.,"on to say, ""when I sat with him in the sunlit wood, looking at the"
442,SONNETS.,"gorgeous blue and silver summer sky, he turned to me and said: 'Just"
443,SONNETS.,half of the world died for me when I lost Mr. Thoreau. None of it looks
444,SONNETS.,the same as when I looked at it with him.'... He took me through the
445,SONNETS.,woods and pointed out to me every spot visited and described by his
446,SONNETS.,"friend. Where the hut stood is a little pile of stones, and a sign,"
447,SONNETS.,"'Site of Thoreau's Hut,' and a few steps beyond is the pond with"
448,SONNETS.,"thickly-wooded shore,--everything exquisitely peaceful and beautiful in"
449,SONNETS.,"the afternoon light, and not a sound to be heard except the crickets or"
450,SONNETS.,the 'z-ing' of the locusts which Thoreau has described. Farther on he
451,SONNETS.,"pointed out to me, in the distant landscape, a low roof, the only one"
452,SONNETS.,"visible, which was the roof of Thoreau's birthplace. He had been over"
453,SONNETS.,"there many times, he said, since he lost Mr. Thoreau, but had never gone"
454,SONNETS.,"in,--he was afraid it might look lonely! But he had often sat on a"
455,SONNETS.,"rock in front of the house and looked at it."" On parting from his young"
456,SONNETS.,"friend, Mr. Channing gave her a package, which proved to be a copy of"
457,SONNETS.,"his own book on Thoreau, and the pocket compass which Thoreau carried to"
458,SONNETS.,the Maine woods and on all his excursions. Before leaving the Emersons
459,SONNETS.,"she received the proof-sheets of her drama of ""The Spagnoletto,"" which"
460,SONNETS.,was being printed for private circulation. She showed them to Mr.
461,SONNETS.,"Emerson, who had expressed a wish to see them, and, after reading them,"
462,SONNETS.,"he gave them back to her with the comment that they were ""good."" She"
463,SONNETS.,playfully asked him if he would not give her a bigger word to take home
464,SONNETS.,"to the family. He laughed, and said he did not know of any; but he"
465,SONNETS.,"went on to tell her that he had taken it up, not expecting to read it"
466,SONNETS.,"through, and had not been able to put it down. Every word and line told"
467,SONNETS.,"of richness in the poetry, he said, and as far as he could judge"
468,SONNETS.,"the play had great dramatic opportunities. Early in the autumn ""The"
469,SONNETS.,"Spagnoletto"" appeared,--a tragedy in five acts, the scene laid in Italy,"
470,SONNETS.,1655.
471,SONNETS.,
472,SONNETS.,"Without a doubt, every one in these days will take up with misgiving,"
473,SONNETS.,"and like Mr. Emerson ""not expecting to read it through,"" a five-act"
474,SONNETS.,"tragedy of the seventeenth century, so far removed apparently from the"
475,SONNETS.,"age and present actualities,--so opposed to the ""Modernite,"" which has"
476,SONNETS.,"come to be the last word of art. Moreover, great names at once appear;"
477,SONNETS.,great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous new-comer in this highest
478,SONNETS.,"realm of expression. ""The Spagnoletto"" has grave defects that would"
479,SONNETS.,probably preclude its ever being represented on the stage. The denoument
480,SONNETS.,"especially is unfortunate, and sins against our moral and aesthetic"
481,SONNETS.,"instinct. The wretched, tiger-like father stabs himself in the presence"
482,SONNETS.,"of his crushed and erring daughter, so that she may forever be haunted"
483,SONNETS.,"by the horror and the retribution of his death. We are left suspended,"
484,SONNETS.,"as it were, over an abyss, our moral judgment thwarted, our humanity"
485,SONNETS.,"outraged. But ""The Spagnoletto"" is, nevertheless, a remarkable"
486,SONNETS.,"production, and pitched in another key from anything the writer has"
487,SONNETS.,"yet given us. Heretofore we have only had quiet, reflective, passive"
488,SONNETS.,emotion: now we have a storm and sweep of passion for which we were
489,SONNETS.,quite unprepared. Ribera's character is charged like a thunder-cloud
490,SONNETS.,"with dramatic elements. Maria Rosa is the child of her father, fired at"
491,SONNETS.,"a flash, ""deaf, dumb, and blind"" at the touch of passion."
492,SONNETS.,
493,SONNETS.,
494,SONNETS.,"""Does love steal gently o'er our soul?"""
495,SONNETS.,
496,SONNETS.,she asks;
497,SONNETS.,
498,SONNETS.,
499,SONNETS.,"""What if he come,"
500,SONNETS.,"A cloud, a fire, a whirlwind?"""
501,SONNETS.,
502,SONNETS.,and then the cry:
503,SONNETS.,
504,SONNETS.,
505,SONNETS.,"""O my God!"
506,SONNETS.,"This awful joy in mine own heart is love."""
507,SONNETS.,
508,SONNETS.,Again:
509,SONNETS.,
510,SONNETS.,
511,SONNETS.,"""While you are here the one thing real to me"
512,SONNETS.,"In all the universe is love."""
513,SONNETS.,
514,SONNETS.,
515,SONNETS.,Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes--at the ball and in
516,SONNETS.,the garden--between the dashing prince-lover in search of his pleasure
517,SONNETS.,"and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes, on her lips, in her"
518,SONNETS.,"hand. Behind them, always like a tragic fate, the somber figure of the"
519,SONNETS.,"Spagnoletto, and over all the glow and color and soul of Italy."
520,SONNETS.,
521,SONNETS.,"In 1881 appeared the translation of Heine's poems and ballads, which was"
522,SONNETS.,generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatable poet. Very
523,SONNETS.,"curious is the link between that bitter, mocking, cynic spirit and the"
524,SONNETS.,"refined, gentle spirit of Emma Lazarus. Charmed by the magic of his"
525,SONNETS.,"verse, the iridescent play of his fancy, and the sudden cry of the heart"
526,SONNETS.,"piercing through it all, she is as yet unaware or only vaguely conscious"
527,SONNETS.,"of the of the real bond between them: the sympathy in the blood,"
528,SONNETS.,"the deep, tragic, Judaic passion of eighteen hundred years that was"
529,SONNETS.,"smouldering in her own heart, soon to break out and change the whole"
530,SONNETS.,current of thought and feeling.
531,SONNETS.,
532,SONNETS.,"Already, in 1879, the storm was gathering. In a distant province of"
533,SONNETS.,"Russia at first, then on the banks of the Volga, and finally in Moscow"
534,SONNETS.,"itself, the old cry was raised, the hideous mediaeval charge revived,"
535,SONNETS.,and the standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews. Province
536,SONNETS.,"after province took it up. In Bulgaria, Servia, and, above all,"
537,SONNETS.,"Roumania, where, we were told, the sword of the Czar had been drawn to"
538,SONNETS.,"protect the oppressed, Christian atrocities took the place of Moslem"
539,SONNETS.,"atrocities, and history turned a page backward into the dark annals of"
540,SONNETS.,"violence and crime. And not alone in despotic Russia, but in Germany,"
541,SONNETS.,"the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture, the rage of"
542,SONNETS.,Anti-Semitism broke out and spread with fatal ease and potency. In
543,SONNETS.,Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened. We in America could
544,SONNETS.,"scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports, and for a while"
545,SONNETS.,we shut our eyes and ears to the facts; but we were soon rudely awakened
546,SONNETS.,"from our insensibility, and forced to face the truth. It was in England"
547,SONNETS.,that the voice was first raised in behalf of justice and humanity.
548,SONNETS.,"In January, 1881, there appeared in the ""London Times"" a series of"
549,SONNETS.,"articles, carefully compiled on the testimony of eye-witnesses, and"
550,SONNETS.,"confirmed by official documents, records, etc., giving an account of"
551,SONNETS.,events that had been taking place in southern and western Russia during
552,SONNETS.,"a period of nine months, between April and December of 1880. We do"
553,SONNETS.,not need to recall the sickening details. The headings will suffice:
554,SONNETS.,"outrage, murder, arson, and pillage, and the result,--100,000 Jewish"
555,SONNETS.,"families made homeless and destitute, and nearly $100,000,000 worth of"
556,SONNETS.,property destroyed. Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy
557,SONNETS.,"and indignation from America. ""It is not that it is the oppression"
558,SONNETS.,"of Jews by Russia,"" said Mr. Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall"
559,SONNETS.,"Wednesday evening, February 4; ""it is that it is the oppression of men"
560,SONNETS.,"and women, and we are men and women."" So spoke civilized Christendom,"
561,SONNETS.,"and for Judaism,--who can describe that thrill of brotherhood, quickened"
562,SONNETS.,"anew, the immortal pledge of the race, made one again through sorrow?"
563,SONNETS.,For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awoke slumbering and
564,SONNETS.,unguessed echoes. All this time she had been seeking heroic ideals in
565,SONNETS.,"alien stock, soulless and far removed; in pagan mythology and mystic,"
566,SONNETS.,"mediaeval Christianity, ignoring her very birthright,--the majestic"
567,SONNETS.,"vista of the past, down which, ""high above flood and fire,"" had been"
568,SONNETS.,conveyed the precious scroll of the Moral Law. Hitherto Judaism had been
569,SONNETS.,"a dead letter to her. Of Portuguese descent, her family had always been"
570,SONNETS.,"members of the oldest and most orthodox congregation of New York, where"
571,SONNETS.,strict adherence to custom and ceremonial was the watchword of faith;
572,SONNETS.,but it was only during her childhood and earliest years that she
573,SONNETS.,"attended the synagogue, and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages"
574,SONNETS.,which she had now long since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing
575,SONNETS.,on modern life. Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people. As
576,SONNETS.,"late as April, 1882, she published in ""The Century Magazine"" an"
577,SONNETS.,"article written probably some months before, entitled ""Was the Earl of"
578,SONNETS.,"Beaconsfield a Representative Jew?"" in which she is disposed to accept"
579,SONNETS.,"as the type of the modern Jew the brilliant, successful, but not"
580,SONNETS.,"over-scrupulous chevalier d'industrie. In view of subsequent, or rather"
581,SONNETS.,"contemporaneous events, the closing paragraph of the article in question"
582,SONNETS.,is worthy of being cited:--
583,SONNETS.,
584,SONNETS.,
585,SONNETS.,"""Thus far their religion [the Jewish], whose mere preservation"
586,SONNETS.,"under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle,"
587,SONNETS.,has been deprived of the natural means of development and
588,SONNETS.,"progress, and has remained a stationary force.  The next"
589,SONNETS.,"hundred years will, in our opinion be the test of their"
590,SONNETS.,vitality as a people; the phase of toleration upon which
591,SONNETS.,they are only now entering will prove whether or not they
592,SONNETS.,"are capable of growth."""
593,SONNETS.,
594,SONNETS.,
595,SONNETS.,"By a curious, almost fateful juxtaposition, in the same number of the"
596,SONNETS.,"magazine appeared Madame Ragozin's defense of Russian barbarity, and in"
597,SONNETS.,"the following (May) number Emma Lazarus's impassioned appeal and reply,"
598,SONNETS.,"""Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism."" From this time dated the"
599,SONNETS.,"crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race, and the consequent"
600,SONNETS.,"expansion of all her faculties, the growth of spiritual power which"
601,SONNETS.,always ensues when a great cause is espoused and a strong conviction
602,SONNETS.,"enters the soul. Her verse rang out as it had never rung before,--a"
603,SONNETS.,"clarion note, calling a people to heroic action and unity, to the"
604,SONNETS.,consciousness and fulfillment of a grand destiny. When has Judaism been
605,SONNETS.,"so stirred as by ""The Crowing of the Red Cock"" and"

712,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"set in, and ship after ship came laden with hunted human beings flying"

973,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"incentive and ambition, and had spurred her on when her own confidence"

1049,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"the following winter. In June she was in England again, and spent the"
1050,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,summer at Malvern. Disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon
1051,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"her, for she was oppressed at times by a languor and heaviness amounting"
1052,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"almost to lethargy. When she returned to London, however, in September,"
1053,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she felt quite well again, and started for another tour in Holland,"
1054,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"which she enjoyed as much as before. She then settled in Paris, to await"
1055,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,the time when she could return to Italy. But she was attacked at once
1056,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"with grave and alarming symptoms, that betokened a fatal end to her"
1057,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"malady. Entirely ignorant, however, of the danger that threatened her,"
1058,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she kept up courage and hope, made plans for the journey, and looked"
1059,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,forward to setting out at any moment. But the weeks passed and the
1060,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,months also; slowly and gradually the hope faded. The journey to Italy
1061,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"must be given up; she was not in condition to be brought home, and she"
1062,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"reluctantly resigned herself to remain where she was and ""convalesce,"""
1063,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"as she confidently believed, in the spring. Once again came the analogy,"
1064,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"which she herself pointed out now, to Heine on his mattress-grave in"
1065,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Paris. She, too, the last time she went out, dragged herself to the"
1066,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Louvre, to the feet of the Venus, ""the goddess without arms, who could"
1067,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"not help."" Only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed"
1068,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"to keep her alive. She sunk to a very low ebb, but, as she herself"
1069,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"expressed it, she ""seemed to have always one little window looking out"
1070,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"into life,"" and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few"
1071,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,drives and to sit on the balcony of her apartment. She came back to
1072,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"life with a feverish sort of thirst and avidity. ""No such cure for"
1073,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"pessimism,"" she says, ""as a severe illness; the simplest pleasures are"
1074,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"enough,--to breathe the air and see the sun."""
1075,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1076,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Many plans were made for leaving Paris, but it was finally decided to"
1077,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"risk the ocean voyage and bring her home, and accordingly she sailed"
1078,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"July 23rd, arriving in New York on the last day of that month."
1079,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1080,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"She did not rally after this; and now began her long agony, full of"
1081,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"every kind of suffering, mental and physical. Only her intellect seemed"
1082,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"kindled anew, and none but those who saw her during the last supreme"
1083,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit before
1084,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"its extinction. Never did she appear so brilliant. Wasted to a shadow,"
1085,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"and between acute attacks of pain, she talked about art, poetry, the"
1086,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"scenes of travel, of which her brain was so full, and the phases of her"
1087,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"own condition, with an eloquence for which even those who knew her best"
1088,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,were quite unprepared. Every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense
1089,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"quickened as the ""strong deliveress"" approached, and the ardent soul was"
1090,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,released from the frame that could no longer contain it.
1091,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1092,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a
1093,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and so vitally
1094,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,endowed thus cut off in its prime. But for us it is not fitting to
1095,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"question or repine, but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that"
1096,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"we hold. What is any life, even the most rounded and complete, but a"
1097,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"fragment and a hint? What Emma Lazarus might have accomplished, had she"
1098,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"been spared, it is idle and even ungrateful to speculate. What she did"
1099,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,accomplish has real and peculiar significance. It is the privilege of
1100,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality
1101,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,shall add lustre and value to what they achieve. To be born a Jewess was
1102,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"a distinction for Emma Lazarus, and she in turn conferred distinction"
1103,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,upon her race. To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle
1104,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,magnetism to her influence. Nowhere is there contradiction or
1105,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"incongruity. Her works bear the imprint of her character, and her"
1106,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"character of her works; the same directness and honesty, the same limpid"
1107,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"purity of tone, and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful."
1108,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"The vulgar, the false, and the ignoble,--she scarcely comprehended them,"
1109,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,while on every side she was open and ready to take in and respond to
1110,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"whatever can adorn and enrich life. Literature was no mere ""profession"""
1111,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"for her, which shut out other possibilities; it was only a free, wide"
1112,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,horizon and background for culture. She was passionately devoted to
1113,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"music, which inspired some of her best poems; and during the last years"
1114,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"of her life, in hours of intense physical suffering, she found relief"
1115,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and consolation in listening to the strains of Bach and Beethoven. When
1116,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she went abroad, painting was revealed to her, and she threw herself"
1117,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,with the same ardor and enthusiasm into the study of the great masters;
1118,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,her last work (left unfinished) was a critical analysis of the genius
1119,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and personality of Rembrandt.
1120,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1121,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"And now, at the end, we ask, Has the grave really closed over all these"
1122,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"gifts? Has that eager, passionate striving ceased, and ""is the rest"
1123,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"silence?"""
1124,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1125,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Who knows? But would we break, if we could, that repose, that silence"
1126,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and mystery and peace everlasting?

1238,EPOCHS.,Thick sultry mists the distant hill-tops shroud;
1239,EPOCHS.,The sunshine dies; athwart black skies of lead

1242,EPOCHS.,
1243,EPOCHS.,"Breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow,"

1270,EPOCHS.,"With wild self-pitying grief of one betrayed,"
1271,EPOCHS.,Duped in a land of dreams where Truth is dead!
1272,EPOCHS.,
1273,EPOCHS.,
1274,EPOCHS.,Are these the heavens that she deemed were kind?
1275,EPOCHS.,Is this the world that yesterday was fair?
1276,EPOCHS.,What painted images of folk half-blind
1277,EPOCHS.,"Be these who pass her by, as vague as air?"
1278,EPOCHS.,What go they seeking? there is naught to find.

1301,EPOCHS.,
1302,EPOCHS.,
1303,EPOCHS.,"There is no comfort looking forth nor back,"
1304,EPOCHS.,The present gives the lie to all her past.
1305,EPOCHS.,Will cruel time restore what she doth lack?
1306,EPOCHS.,Why was no shadow of this doom forecast?
1307,EPOCHS.,Ah! she hath played with many a keen-edged thing;
1308,EPOCHS.,Naught is too small and soft to turn and sting.
1309,EPOCHS.,
1310,EPOCHS.,
1311,EPOCHS.,"In the unnatural glory of the hour,"

1322,EPOCHS.,
1323,EPOCHS.,
1324,EPOCHS.,"Yea, she hath looked Truth grimly face to face,"

1326,EPOCHS.,"This silence is not patience, nor the grace"
1327,EPOCHS.,"Of recognition, meekly offered up,"
1328,EPOCHS.,"But mere acceptance fraught with keenest pain,"
1329,EPOCHS.,Seeing that all her struggles must be vain.
1330,EPOCHS.,
1331,EPOCHS.,
1332,EPOCHS.,"Her future clear and terrible outlies,--"
1333,EPOCHS.,"This burden to be borne through all her days,"
1334,EPOCHS.,"This crown of thorns pressed down above her eyes,"
1335,EPOCHS.,This weight of trouble she may never raise.
1336,EPOCHS.,No reconcilement doth she ask nor wait;
1337,EPOCHS.,"Knowing such things are, she endures her fate."
1338,EPOCHS.,
1339,EPOCHS.,
1340,EPOCHS.,No brave endeavor of the broken will
1341,EPOCHS.,To cling to such poor stays as will abide
1342,EPOCHS.,(Although the waves be wild and angry still)
1343,EPOCHS.,After the lapsing of the swollen tide.
1344,EPOCHS.,"No fear of further loss, no hope of gain,"

1356,EPOCHS.,Herself alone and lonely evermore.
1357,EPOCHS.,"Folk come and go, and reach her in no wise,"
1358,EPOCHS.,Mere flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes.
1359,EPOCHS.,
1360,EPOCHS.,
1361,EPOCHS.,"All outward things, that once seemed part of her,"
1362,EPOCHS.,"Fall from her, like the leaves in autumn shed."
1363,EPOCHS.,"She feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh,"
1364,EPOCHS.,"With the heart eaten out, a long time dead;"
1365,EPOCHS.,"Unchanged without, the features and the form;"
1366,EPOCHS.,"Within, devoured by the thin red worm."
1367,EPOCHS.,
1368,EPOCHS.,
1369,EPOCHS.,"By her own prowess she must stand or fall,"
1370,EPOCHS.,This grief is to be conquered day by day.
1371,EPOCHS.,"Who could befriend her? who could make this small,"
1372,EPOCHS.,Or her strength great? she meets it as she may.
1373,EPOCHS.,"A weary struggle and a constant pain,"

1381,EPOCHS.,
1382,EPOCHS.,"It comes not in such wise as she had deemed,"
1383,EPOCHS.,Else might she still have clung to her despair.
1384,EPOCHS.,"More tender, grateful than she could have dreamed,"
1385,EPOCHS.,"Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair,"
1386,EPOCHS.,"And gentle words borne softly through the air,"
1387,EPOCHS.,"Calming her weary sense and wildered mind,"
1388,EPOCHS.,"By welcome, dear communion with her kind."
1389,EPOCHS.,
1390,EPOCHS.,
1391,EPOCHS.,Ah! she forswore all words as empty lies;
1392,EPOCHS.,"What speech could help, encourage, or repair?"
1393,EPOCHS.,"Yet when she meets these grave, indulgent eyes,"
1394,EPOCHS.,"Fulfilled with pity, simplest words are fair,"
1395,EPOCHS.,"Caressing, meaningless, that do not dare"
1396,EPOCHS.,"To compensate or mend, but merely soothe"
1397,EPOCHS.,With hopeful visions after bitter Truth.
1398,EPOCHS.,
1399,EPOCHS.,
1400,EPOCHS.,"One who through conquered trouble had grown wise,"
1401,EPOCHS.,"To read the grief unspoken, unexpressed,"
1402,EPOCHS.,"The misery of the blank and heavy eyes,--"
1403,EPOCHS.,Or through youth's infinite compassion guessed
1404,EPOCHS.,"The heavy burden,--such a one brought rest,"
1405,EPOCHS.,"And bade her lay aside her doubts and fears,"
1406,EPOCHS.,While the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears.

1410,EPOCHS.,
1411,EPOCHS.,X. Patience.
1412,EPOCHS.,
1413,EPOCHS.,
1414,EPOCHS.,The passion of despair is quelled at last;
1415,EPOCHS.,"The cruel sense of undeserved wrong,"
1416,EPOCHS.,"The wild self-pity, these are also past;"
1417,EPOCHS.,"She knows not what may come, but she is strong;"
1418,EPOCHS.,"She feels she hath not aught to lose nor gain,"
1419,EPOCHS.,Her patience is the essence of all pain.
1420,EPOCHS.,
1421,EPOCHS.,
1422,EPOCHS.,"As one who sits beside a lapsing stream,"
1423,EPOCHS.,"She sees the flow of changeless day by day,"
1424,EPOCHS.,"Too sick and tired to think, too sad to dream,"
1425,EPOCHS.,"Nor cares how soon the waters slip away,"
1426,EPOCHS.,"Nor where they lead; at the wise God's decree,"
1427,EPOCHS.,She will depart or bide indifferently.
1428,EPOCHS.,
1429,EPOCHS.,
1430,EPOCHS.,There is deeper pathos in the mild
1431,EPOCHS.,"And settled sorrow of the quiet eyes,"
1432,EPOCHS.,"Than in the tumults of the anguish wild,"
1433,EPOCHS.,That made her curse all things beneath the skies;
1434,EPOCHS.,"No question, no reproaches, no complaint,"
1435,EPOCHS.,Hers is the holy calm of some meek saint.

1442,EPOCHS.,
1443,EPOCHS.,"Her languid pulses thrill with sudden hope,"

1446,EPOCHS.,"Illimitably lofty, long, and wide."
1447,EPOCHS.,"What doth she know?  She is subdued and mild,"
1448,EPOCHS.,"Quiet and docile ""as a weaned child."""
1449,EPOCHS.,
1450,EPOCHS.,
1451,EPOCHS.,"If grief came in such unimagined wise,"
1452,EPOCHS.,"How may joy dawn?  In what undreamed-of hour,"
1453,EPOCHS.,"May the light break with splendor of surprise,"
1454,EPOCHS.,Disclosing all the mercy and the power?
1455,EPOCHS.,"A baseless hope, yet vivid, keen, and bright,"
1456,EPOCHS.,As the wild lightning in the starless night.
1457,EPOCHS.,

1841,ADMETUS.,"But still he tarried, and with sportsman's praise"
1842,ADMETUS.,"Admired the hound and stooped to stroke its head,"
1843,ADMETUS.,"And asked her if she hunted.  Nay, not she:"
1844,ADMETUS.,"Her father Pelias hunted in these woods,"

1847,ADMETUS.,"No goddess, but a mortal, to be won"
1848,ADMETUS.,By such a simple feat as driving boars

1902,ADMETUS.,"And men aloud worship, though the very god"
1903,ADMETUS.,"Who wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh,"
1904,ADMETUS.,Divinely scornful of neglect or praise.
1905,ADMETUS.,"Then Pelias, seeing this would be his son,"
1906,ADMETUS.,"As he had vowed, called for his wife and child."
1907,ADMETUS.,"With Anaxibia, Alcestis came,"
1908,ADMETUS.,A warm flush spreading o'er her eager face
1909,ADMETUS.,"In looking on the rider of the woods,"
1910,ADMETUS.,And knowing him her suitor and the king.
1911,ADMETUS.,
1912,ADMETUS.,
1913,ADMETUS.,"Admetus won Alcestis thus to wife,"
1914,ADMETUS.,And these with mated hearts and mutual love
1915,ADMETUS.,"Lived a life blameless, beautiful: the king"
1916,ADMETUS.,"Ordaining justice in the gates; the queen,"
1917,ADMETUS.,"With grateful offerings to the household gods,"
1918,ADMETUS.,Wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart.
1919,ADMETUS.,"One child she bore,--Eumelus,--and he throve."
1920,ADMETUS.,Yet none the less because they sacrificed
1921,ADMETUS.,"The firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers,"
1922,ADMETUS.,Did trouble come; for sickness seized the king.
1923,ADMETUS.,"Alcestis watched with many-handed love,"
1924,ADMETUS.,"But unavailing service, for he lay"
1925,ADMETUS.,"With languid limbs, despite his ancient strength"
1926,ADMETUS.,"Of sinew, and his skill with spear and sword."
1927,ADMETUS.,"His mother came, Clymene, and with her"
1928,ADMETUS.,"His father, Pheres: his unconscious child"
1929,ADMETUS.,"They brought him, while forlorn Alcestis sat"
1930,ADMETUS.,"Discouraged, with the face of desolation."
1931,ADMETUS.,"The jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech,"
1932,ADMETUS.,And smite his vigorous frame with impotence;
1933,ADMETUS.,"And ruin with bitter ashes, worms, and dust,"
1934,ADMETUS.,"The beauty of his crowned, exalted head."
1935,ADMETUS.,"He knew her presence,--soon he would not know,"
1936,ADMETUS.,"Nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close,"
1937,ADMETUS.,Nor care if she were near him any more.
1938,ADMETUS.,"Exhausted with long vigils, thus the queen"
1939,ADMETUS.,"Held hard and grievous thoughts, till heavy sleep"
1940,ADMETUS.,"Possessed her weary sense, and she dreamed."
1941,ADMETUS.,"And even in her dream her trouble lived,"
1942,ADMETUS.,For she was praying in a barren field
1943,ADMETUS.,"To all the gods for help, when came across"
1944,ADMETUS.,"The waste of air and land, from distant skies,"
1945,ADMETUS.,"A spiritual voice divinely clear,"
1946,ADMETUS.,Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilled
1947,ADMETUS.,Her aching heart with tremor of strange joy:
1948,ADMETUS.,"""Arise, Alcestis, cast away white fear."
1949,ADMETUS.,"A god dwells with you: seek, and you shall find."""
1950,ADMETUS.,Then quiet satisfaction filled her soul
1951,ADMETUS.,"Almost akin to gladness, and she woke."
1952,ADMETUS.,"Weak as the dead, Admetus lay there still;"
1953,ADMETUS.,"But she, superb with confidence, arose,"
1954,ADMETUS.,"And passed beyond the mourners' curious eyes,"
1955,ADMETUS.,Seeking Amphryssius in the meadow-lands.
1956,ADMETUS.,She found him with the godlike mien of one
1957,ADMETUS.,"Who, roused, awakens unto deeds divine:"
1958,ADMETUS.,"""I come, Hyperion, with incessant tears,"
1959,ADMETUS.,To crave the life of my dear lord the king.
1960,ADMETUS.,"Pity me, for I see the future years"
1961,ADMETUS.,Widowed and laden with disastrous days.
1962,ADMETUS.,"And ye, the gods, will miss him when the fires"
1963,ADMETUS.,"Upon your shrines, unfed, neglected die."
1964,ADMETUS.,"Who will pour large libations in your names,"
1965,ADMETUS.,And sacrifice with generous piety?
1966,ADMETUS.,Silence and apathy will greet you there
1967,ADMETUS.,Where once a splendid spirit offered praise.
1968,ADMETUS.,"Grant me this boon divine, and I will beat"
1969,ADMETUS.,"With prayer at morning's gates, before they ope"
1970,ADMETUS.,Unto thy silver-hoofed and flame-eyed steeds.
1971,ADMETUS.,Answer ere yet the irremeable stream
1972,ADMETUS.,"Be crossed: answer, O god, and save!"""
1973,ADMETUS.,"She ceased,"
1974,ADMETUS.,"With full throat salt with tears, and looked on him,"
1975,ADMETUS.,"And with a sudden cry of awe fell prone,"
1976,ADMETUS.,"For, lo! he was transmuted to a god;"
1977,ADMETUS.,"The supreme aureole radiant round his brow,"
1978,ADMETUS.,"Divine refulgences on his face,--his eyes"
1979,ADMETUS.,"Awful with splendor, and his august head"
1980,ADMETUS.,With blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame.
1981,ADMETUS.,Then in a voice that charmed the listening air:
1982,ADMETUS.,"""Woman, arise! I have no influence"
1983,ADMETUS.,"On Death, who is the servant of the Fates."
1984,ADMETUS.,"Howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer,"
1985,ADMETUS.,"The grace of thy fair womanhood and youth,"
1986,ADMETUS.,"Thus godlike will I intercede for thee,"
1987,ADMETUS.,And sue the insatiate sisters for this life.
1988,ADMETUS.,Yet hope not blindly: loth are these to change
1989,ADMETUS.,"Their purpose; neither will they freely give,"
1990,ADMETUS.,But haggling lend or sell: perchance the price
1991,ADMETUS.,Will counterveil the boon.  Consider this.
1992,ADMETUS.,"Now rise and look upon me.""  And she rose,"
1993,ADMETUS.,"But by her stood no godhead bathed in light,"
1994,ADMETUS.,"But young Amphryssius, herdsman to the king,"
1995,ADMETUS.,Benignly smiling.
1996,ADMETUS.,"Fleet as thought, the god"
1997,ADMETUS.,Fled from the glittering earth to blackest depths
1998,ADMETUS.,Of Tartarus; and none might say he sped
1999,ADMETUS.,"On wings ambrosial, or with feet as swift"
2000,ADMETUS.,"As scouring hail, or airy chariot"
2001,ADMETUS.,Borne by the flame-breathing steeds ethereal;
2002,ADMETUS.,But with a motion inconceivable
2003,ADMETUS.,Departed and was there.  Before the throne
2004,ADMETUS.,"Of Ades, first he hailed the long-sought queen,"
2005,ADMETUS.,Stolen with violent hands from grassy fields
2006,ADMETUS.,"And delicate airs of sunlit Sicily,"
2007,ADMETUS.,"Pensive, gold-haired, but innocent-eyed no more"
2008,ADMETUS.,"As when she laughing plucked the daffodils,"
2009,ADMETUS.,But grave as on fulfilling a strange doom.
2010,ADMETUS.,"And low at Ades' feet, wrapped in grim murk"
2011,ADMETUS.,"And darkness thick, the three gray women sat,"
2012,ADMETUS.,"Loose-robed and chapleted with wool and flowers,"
2013,ADMETUS.,Purple narcissi round their horrid hair.
2014,ADMETUS.,"Intent upon her task, the first one held"
2015,ADMETUS.,The tender thread that at a touch would snap;
2016,ADMETUS.,The second weaving it with warp and woof
2017,ADMETUS.,"Into strange textures, some stained dark and foul,"
2018,ADMETUS.,"Some sanguine-colored, and some black as night,"
2019,ADMETUS.,"And rare ones white, or with a golden thread"
2020,ADMETUS.,Running throughout the web: the farthest hag
2021,ADMETUS.,With glistening scissors cut her sisters' work.
2022,ADMETUS.,"To these Hyperion, but they never ceased,"
2023,ADMETUS.,"Nor raised their eyes, till with soft, moderate tones,"
2024,ADMETUS.,But by their powerful persuasiveness
2025,ADMETUS.,"Commanding all to listen and obey,"
2026,ADMETUS.,"He spoke, and all hell heard, and these three looked"
2027,ADMETUS.,And waited his request:
2028,ADMETUS.,"I come, a god,"
2029,ADMETUS.,"At pure mortal queen's request, who sues"
2030,ADMETUS.,"For life renewed unto her dying lord,"
2031,ADMETUS.,"Admetus; and I also pray this prayer."""
2032,ADMETUS.,"""Then cease, for when hath Fate been moved by prayer?"""
2033,ADMETUS.,"""But strength and upright heart should serve with you."""
2034,ADMETUS.,"""I ask ye not forever to forbear,"
2035,ADMETUS.,"But spare a while,--a moment unto us,"
2036,ADMETUS.,"A lifetime unto men.""  ""The Fates swerve not"
2037,ADMETUS.,"For supplications, like the pliant gods."
2038,ADMETUS.,Have they not willed a life's thread should be cut?
2039,ADMETUS.,With them the will is changeless as the deed.
2040,ADMETUS.,"O men! ye have not learned in all the past,"
2041,ADMETUS.,Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit.
2042,ADMETUS.,How long will ye besiege the thrones of gods
2043,ADMETUS.,With lamentations?  When lagged Death for all
2044,ADMETUS.,"Your timorous shirking?  We work not like you,"
2045,ADMETUS.,"Delaying and relenting, purposeless,"
2046,ADMETUS.,"With unenduring issues; but our deeds,"
2047,ADMETUS.,"Forever interchained and interlocked,"
2048,ADMETUS.,"Complete each other and explain themselves."""
2049,ADMETUS.,"""Ye will a life: then why not any life?"""
2050,ADMETUS.,"""What care we for the king?  He is not worth"
2051,ADMETUS.,"These many words; indeed, we love not speech."
2052,ADMETUS.,"We care not if he live, or lose such life"
2053,ADMETUS.,"As men are greedy for,--filled full with hate,"
2054,ADMETUS.,"Sins beneath scorn, and only lit by dreams,"
2055,ADMETUS.,"Or one sane moment, or a useless hope,--"
2056,ADMETUS.,Lasting how long?--the space between the green
2057,ADMETUS.,"And fading yellow of the grass they tread."""
2058,ADMETUS.,"But he withdrawing not: ""Will any life"
2059,ADMETUS.,"Suffice ye for Admetus?""  ""Yea,"" the crones"
2060,ADMETUS.,"Three times repeated.  ""We know no such names"
2061,ADMETUS.,As king or queen or slave: we want but life.
2062,ADMETUS.,"Begone, and vex us in our work no more."""
2063,ADMETUS.,
2064,ADMETUS.,
2065,ADMETUS.,"With broken blessings, inarticulate joy"
2066,ADMETUS.,"And tears, Alcestis thanked Hyperion,"
2067,ADMETUS.,"And worshipped.  Then he gently: ""Who will die,"
2068,ADMETUS.,"So that the king may live?""  And she: ""You ask?"
2069,ADMETUS.,"Nay, who will live when life clasps hands with shame,"
2070,ADMETUS.,"And death with honor?  Lo, you are a god;"
2071,ADMETUS.,"You cannot know the highest joy of life,--"
2072,ADMETUS.,To leave it when 't is worthier to die.
2073,ADMETUS.,"His parents, kinsmen, courtiers, subjects, slaves,--"
2074,ADMETUS.,"For love of him myself would die, were none"
2075,ADMETUS.,Found ready; but what Greek would stand to see
2076,ADMETUS.,"A woman glorified, and falter?  Once,"
2077,ADMETUS.,"And only once, the gods will do this thing"
2078,ADMETUS.,In all the ages: such a man themselves
2079,ADMETUS.,"Delight to honor,--holy, temperate, chaste,"
2080,ADMETUS.,"With reverence for his daemon and his god."""
2081,ADMETUS.,Thus she triumphant to they very door
2082,ADMETUS.,Of King Admetus' chamber.  All there saw
2083,ADMETUS.,Her ill-timed gladness with much wonderment.
2084,ADMETUS.,"But she: ""No longer mourn!  The king is saved:"
2085,ADMETUS.,The Fates will spare him.  Lift your voice in praise;
2086,ADMETUS.,Sing paeans to Apollo; crown your brows
2087,ADMETUS.,"With laurel; offer thankful sacrifice!"""
2088,ADMETUS.,"""O Queen, what mean these foolish words misplaced?"
2089,ADMETUS.,"And what an hour is this to thank the Fates?"""
2090,ADMETUS.,"""Thrice blessed be the gods!--for God himself"
2091,ADMETUS.,"Has sued for me,--they are not stern and deaf."
2092,ADMETUS.,"Cry, and they answer: commune with your soul,"
2093,ADMETUS.,"And they send counsel: weep with rainy grief,"
2094,ADMETUS.,And these will sweeten you your bitterest tears.
2095,ADMETUS.,"On one condition King Admetus lives,"
2096,ADMETUS.,"And ye, on hearing, will lament no more,"
2097,ADMETUS.,"Each emulous to save.""  Then--for she spake"
2098,ADMETUS.,"Assured, as having heard an oracle--"
2099,ADMETUS.,"They asked: ""What deed of ours may serve the king?"""
2100,ADMETUS.,"""The Fates accept another life for his,"
2101,ADMETUS.,"And one of you may die.""  Smiling, she ceased."
2102,ADMETUS.,"But silence answered her.  ""What! do ye thrust"
2103,ADMETUS.,"Your arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks,"
2104,ADMETUS.,"Dying like Greeks, too proud to own the pang?"
2105,ADMETUS.,This ask I not.  In all the populous land
2106,ADMETUS.,But one need suffer for immortal praise.
2107,ADMETUS.,"The generous Fates have sent no pestilence,"
2108,ADMETUS.,"Famine, nor war: it is as though they gave"
2109,ADMETUS.,"Freely, and only make the boon more rich"
2110,ADMETUS.,"By such slight payment.  Now a people mourns,"
2111,ADMETUS.,"And ye may change the grief to jubilee,"
2112,ADMETUS.,Filling the cities with a pleasant sound.
2113,ADMETUS.,"But as for me, what faltering words can tell"
2114,ADMETUS.,"My joy, in extreme sharpness kin to pain?"
2115,ADMETUS.,"A monument you have within my heart,"
2116,ADMETUS.,Wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances;
2117,ADMETUS.,And I will pray for you before I crave
2118,ADMETUS.,Pardon and pity for myself from God.
2119,ADMETUS.,"Your name will be the highest in the land,"
2120,ADMETUS.,"Oftenest, fondest on my grateful lips,"
2121,ADMETUS.,After the name of him you die to save.
2122,ADMETUS.,What! silent still?  Since when has virtue grown
2123,ADMETUS.,Less beautiful than indolence and ease?
2124,ADMETUS.,"Is death more terrible, more hateworthy,"
2125,ADMETUS.,More bitter than dishonor?  Will ye live
2126,ADMETUS.,On shame?  Chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits?
2127,ADMETUS.,"What sons will ye bring forth--mean-souled like you,"
2128,ADMETUS.,"Or, like your parents, brave--to blush like girls,"
2129,ADMETUS.,"And say,'Our fathers were afraid to die!'"
2130,ADMETUS.,Ye will not dare to raise heroic eyes
2131,ADMETUS.,Unto the eyes of aliens.  In the streets
2132,ADMETUS.,Will women and young children point at you
2133,ADMETUS.,"Scornfully, and the sun will find you shamed,"
2134,ADMETUS.,And night refuse to shield you.  What a life
2135,ADMETUS.,Is this ye spin and fashion for yourselves!
2136,ADMETUS.,And what new tortures of suspense and doubt
2137,ADMETUS.,Will death invent for such as are afraid!
2138,ADMETUS.,"Acastus, thou my brother, in the field"
2139,ADMETUS.,"Foremost, who greeted me with sanguine hands"
2140,ADMETUS.,"From ruddy battle with a conqueror's face,--"
2141,ADMETUS.,These honors wilt thou blot with infamy?
2142,ADMETUS.,"Nay, thou hast won no honors: a mere girl"
2143,ADMETUS.,"Would do as much as thou at such a time,"
2144,ADMETUS.,"In clamorous battle,'midst tumultuous sounds,"
2145,ADMETUS.,"Neighing of war-steeds, shouts of sharp command,"
2146,ADMETUS.,Snapping of shivered spears; for all are brave
2147,ADMETUS.,When all men look to them expectantly;
2148,ADMETUS.,But he is truly brave who faces death
2149,ADMETUS.,"Within his chamber, at a sudden call,"
2150,ADMETUS.,"At night, when no man sees,--content to die"
2151,ADMETUS.,"When life can serve no longer those he loves."""
2152,ADMETUS.,"Then thus Acastus: ""Sister, I fear not"
2153,ADMETUS.,"Death, nor the empty darkness of the grave,"
2154,ADMETUS.,"And hold my life but as a little thing,"
2155,ADMETUS.,"Subject unto my people's call, and Fate."
2156,ADMETUS.,"But if 't is little, no greater is the king's;"
2157,ADMETUS.,"And though my heart bleeds sorely, I recall"
2158,ADMETUS.,"Astydamia, who thus would mourn for me."
2159,ADMETUS.,"We are not cowards, we youth of Thessaly,"
2160,ADMETUS.,"And Thessaly--yea, all Greece--knoweth it;"
2161,ADMETUS.,"Nor will we brook the name from even you,"
2162,ADMETUS.,"Albeit a queen, and uttering these wild words"
2163,ADMETUS.,"Through your umwonted sorrow.""  Then she knew"
2164,ADMETUS.,"That he stood firm, and turning from him, cried"
2165,ADMETUS.,"To the king's parents: ""Are ye deaf with grief,"
2166,ADMETUS.,"Pheres, Clymene?  Ye can save your son,"
2167,ADMETUS.,Yet rather stand and weep with barren tears.
2168,ADMETUS.,"O, shame! to think that such gray, reverend hairs"
2169,ADMETUS.,Should cover such unvenerable heads!
2170,ADMETUS.,"What would ye lose?--a remnant of mere life,"
2171,ADMETUS.,"A few slight raveled threads, and give him years"
2172,ADMETUS.,"To fill with glory.  Who, when he is gone,"
2173,ADMETUS.,"Will call you gentlest names this side of heaven,--"
2174,ADMETUS.,Father and mother?  Knew ye not this man
2175,ADMETUS.,"Ere he was royal,--a poor, helpless child,"
2176,ADMETUS.,Crownless and kingdomless?  One birth alone
2177,ADMETUS.,"Sufficeth not, Clymene: once again"
2178,ADMETUS.,You must give life with travail and strong pain.
2179,ADMETUS.,Has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes?
2180,ADMETUS.,What mother can refuse a second birth
2181,ADMETUS.,"To such a son?  But ye denying him,"
2182,ADMETUS.,What after-offering may appease the gods?
2183,ADMETUS.,What joy outweigh the grief of this one day?
2184,ADMETUS.,"What clamor drown the hours' myriad tongues,"
2185,ADMETUS.,"Crying, 'Your son, your son? where is your son,"
2186,ADMETUS.,"Unnatural mother, timid foolish man?"""
2187,ADMETUS.,"Then Pheres gravely: ""These are graceless words"
2188,ADMETUS.,"From you our daughter.  Life is always life,"
2189,ADMETUS.,And death comes soon enough to such as we.
2190,ADMETUS.,"We twain are old and weak, have served our time,"
2191,ADMETUS.,And made our sacrifices.  Let the young
2192,ADMETUS.,"Arise now in their turn and save the king."""
2193,ADMETUS.,"""O gods! look on your creatures! do ye see?"
2194,ADMETUS.,"And seeing, have ye patience?  Smite them all,"
2195,ADMETUS.,"Unsparing, with dishonorable death."
2196,ADMETUS.,Vile slaves! a woman teaches you to die.
2197,ADMETUS.,"Intrepid, with exalted steadfast soul,"
2198,ADMETUS.,"Scorn in my heart, and love unutterable,"
2199,ADMETUS.,"I yield the Fates my life, and like a god"
2200,ADMETUS.,Command them to revere that sacred head.
2201,ADMETUS.,"Thus kiss I thrice the dear, blind, holy eyes,"
2202,ADMETUS.,"And bid them see; and thrice I kiss this brow,"
2203,ADMETUS.,"And thus unfasten I the pale, proud lips"
2204,ADMETUS.,"With fruitful kissings, bringing love and life,"
2205,ADMETUS.,"And without fear or any pang, I breathe"
2206,ADMETUS.,"My soul in him."""
2207,ADMETUS.,"""Alcestis, I awake."
2208,ADMETUS.,"I hear, I hear--unspeak thy reckless words!"
2209,ADMETUS.,"For, lo! thy life-blood tingles in my veins,"
2210,ADMETUS.,And streameth through my body like new wine.
2211,ADMETUS.,Behold! thy spirit dedicate revives
2212,ADMETUS.,"My pulse, and through thy sacrifice I breathe."
2213,ADMETUS.,Thy lips are bloodless: kiss me not again.
2214,ADMETUS.,"Ashen thy cheeks, faded thy flower-like hands."
2215,ADMETUS.,O woman! perfect in thy womanhood
2216,ADMETUS.,"And in thy wifehood, I adjure thee now"
2217,ADMETUS.,"As mother, by the love thou bearest our child,"
2218,ADMETUS.,"In this thy hour of passion and of love,"
2219,ADMETUS.,"Of sacrifice and sorrow, to unsay"
2220,ADMETUS.,"Thy words sublime!""  ""I die that thou mayest live."""
2221,ADMETUS.,"""And deemest thou that I accept the boon,"
2222,ADMETUS.,"Craven, like these my subjects?  Lo, my queen,"
2223,ADMETUS.,"Is life itself a lovely thing,--bare life?"
2224,ADMETUS.,And empty breath a thing desirable?
2225,ADMETUS.,Or is it rather happiness and love
2226,ADMETUS.,That make it precious to its inmost core?
2227,ADMETUS.,"When these are lost, are there not swords in Greece,"
2228,ADMETUS.,"And flame and poison, deadly waves and plagues?"
2229,ADMETUS.,No man has ever lacked these things and gone
2230,ADMETUS.,Unsatisfied.  It is not these the gods refuse
2231,ADMETUS.,"(Nay, never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip),--"
2232,ADMETUS.,"Not these I seek; but I will stab myself,"
2233,ADMETUS.,"Poison my life and burn my flesh, with words,"
2234,ADMETUS.,And save or follow thee.  Lo! hearken now:
2235,ADMETUS.,I bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts:
2236,ADMETUS.,"O spurn them, and I scorn them, and I hate."
2237,ADMETUS.,Will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers?
2238,ADMETUS.,"With tongue reviling, blasphemous, I curse,"
2239,ADMETUS.,With mouth polluted from deliberate heart.
2240,ADMETUS.,"Dishonored be their names, scorned be their priests,"
2241,ADMETUS.,"Ruined their altars, mocked their oracles!"
2242,ADMETUS.,"It is Admetus, King of Thessaly,"
2243,ADMETUS.,"Defaming thus: annihilate him, gods!"
2244,ADMETUS.,"So that his queen, who worships you, may live."""
2245,ADMETUS.,He paused as one expectant; but no bolt
2246,ADMETUS.,"From the insulted heavens answered him,"
2247,ADMETUS.,"But awful silence followed.  Then a hand,"
2248,ADMETUS.,"A boyish hand, upon his shoulder fell,"
2249,ADMETUS.,"And turning, he beheld his shepherd boy,"
2250,ADMETUS.,"Not wrathful, but divinely pitiful,"
2251,ADMETUS.,"Who spake in tender, thrilling tones: ""The gods"
2252,ADMETUS.,Cannot recall their gifts.  Blaspheme them not:
2253,ADMETUS.,Bow down and worship rather.  Shall he curse
2254,ADMETUS.,"Who sees not, and who hears not,--neither knows"
2255,ADMETUS.,"Nor understands?  Nay, thou shalt bless and pray,--"
2256,ADMETUS.,"Pray, for the pure heart purged by prayer, divines"
2257,ADMETUS.,And seeth when the bolder eyes are blind.
2258,ADMETUS.,"Worship and wonder,--these befit a man"
2259,ADMETUS.,At every hour; and mayhap will the gods
2260,ADMETUS.,Yet work a miracle for knees that bend
2261,ADMETUS.,"And hands that supplicate."""
2262,ADMETUS.,Then all they knew
2263,ADMETUS.,"A sudden sense of awe, and bowed their heads"
2264,ADMETUS.,"Beneath the stripling's gaze: Admetus fell,"
2265,ADMETUS.,"Crushed by that gentle touch, and cried aloud:"
2266,ADMETUS.,"""Pardon and pity! I am hard beset."""

2274,ADMETUS.,
2275,ADMETUS.,
2276,ADMETUS.,There waited at the doorway of the king
2277,ADMETUS.,"One grim and ghastly, shadowy, horrible,"
2278,ADMETUS.,"Bearing the likeness of a king himself,"
2279,ADMETUS.,"Erect as one who serveth not,--upon"
2280,ADMETUS.,"His head a crown, within his fleshless hands"
2281,ADMETUS.,"A sceptre,--monstrous, winged, intolerable."
2282,ADMETUS.,"To him a stranger coming 'neath the trees,"
2283,ADMETUS.,"Which slid down flakes of light, now on his hair,"
2284,ADMETUS.,"Close-curled, now on his bared and brawny chest,"
2285,ADMETUS.,"Now on his flexile, vine-like veined limbs,"
2286,ADMETUS.,"With iron network of strong muscle thewed,"
2287,ADMETUS.,And godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed.
2288,ADMETUS.,Firm was his step; no superfluity
2289,ADMETUS.,Of indolent flesh impeded this man's strength.
2290,ADMETUS.,"Slender and supple every perfect limb,"
2291,ADMETUS.,Beautiful with the glory of a man.
2292,ADMETUS.,"No weapons bare he, neither shield: his hands"
2293,ADMETUS.,"Folded upon his breast, his movements free"
2294,ADMETUS.,Of all incumbrance.  When his mighty strides
2295,ADMETUS.,"Had brought him nigh the waiting one, he paused:"
2296,ADMETUS.,"""Whose palace this? and who art thou, grim shade?"""
2297,ADMETUS.,"""The palace of the King of Thessaly,"
2298,ADMETUS.,And my name is not strange unto thine ears;
2299,ADMETUS.,"For who hath told men that I wait for them,"
2300,ADMETUS.,"The one sure thing on earth?  Yet all they know,"
2301,ADMETUS.,"Unasking and yet answered.  I am Death,"
2302,ADMETUS.,The only secret that the gods reveal.
2303,ADMETUS.,"But who are thou who darest question me?"""
2304,ADMETUS.,"""Alcides; and that thing I dare not do"
2305,ADMETUS.,"Hath found no name.  Whom here awaitest thou?"""
2306,ADMETUS.,"""Alcestis, Queen of Thessaly,--a queen"
2307,ADMETUS.,"Who wooed me as the bridegroom woos the bride,"
2308,ADMETUS.,For her life sacrificed will save her lord
2309,ADMETUS.,"Admetus, as the Fates decreed.  I wait"
2310,ADMETUS.,"Impatient, eager; and I enter soon,"
2311,ADMETUS.,"With darkening wing, invisible, a god,"
2312,ADMETUS.,"And kiss her lips, and kiss her throbbing heart,"
2313,ADMETUS.,And then the tenderest hands can do no more
2314,ADMETUS.,"Than close her eyes and wipe her cold, white brow,"
2315,ADMETUS.,"Inurn her ashes and strew flowers above."""
2316,ADMETUS.,"""This woman is a god, a hero, Death."
2317,ADMETUS.,In this her sacrifice I see a soul
2318,ADMETUS.,"Luminous, starry: earth can spare her not:"
2319,ADMETUS.,It is not rich enough in purity
2320,ADMETUS.,"To lose this paragon.  Save her, O Death!"
2321,ADMETUS.,"Thou surely art more gentle than the Fates,"
2322,ADMETUS.,"Yet these have spared her lord, and never meant"
2323,ADMETUS.,"That she should suffer, and that this their grace,"
2324,ADMETUS.,"Beautiful, royal on one side, should turn"
2325,ADMETUS.,"Sudden and show a fearful, fatal face."""
2326,ADMETUS.,"""Nay, have they not?  O fond and foolish man,"
2327,ADMETUS.,"Naught comes unlooked for, unforeseen by them."
2328,ADMETUS.,"Doubt when they favor thee, though thou mayest laugh"
2329,ADMETUS.,When they have scourged thee with an iron scourge.
2330,ADMETUS.,"Behold, their smile is deadlier than their sting,"
2331,ADMETUS.,And every boon of theirs is double-faced.
2332,ADMETUS.,"Yea, I am gentler unto ye than these:"
2333,ADMETUS.,"I slay relentless, but when have I mocked"
2334,ADMETUS.,"With poisoned gifts, and generous hands that smite"
2335,ADMETUS.,Under the flowers? for my name is Truth.
2336,ADMETUS.,"Were this fair queen more fair, more pure, more chaste,"
2337,ADMETUS.,I would not spare her for your wildest prayer
2338,ADMETUS.,Nor her best virtue.  Is the earth's mouth full?
2339,ADMETUS.,"Is the grave satisfied?  Discrown me then,"
2340,ADMETUS.,"For life is lord, and men may mock the gods"
2341,ADMETUS.,"With immortality.""  ""I sue no more,"
2342,ADMETUS.,"But I command thee spare this woman's life,"
2343,ADMETUS.,"Or wrestle with Alcides.""  ""Wrestle with thee,"
2344,ADMETUS.,"Thou puny boy!""  And Death laughed loud, and swelled"
2345,ADMETUS.,"To monstrous bulk, fierce-eyed, with outstretched wings,"
2346,ADMETUS.,"And lightnings round his brow; but grave and firm,"
2347,ADMETUS.,"Strong as a tower, Alcides waited him,"
2348,ADMETUS.,"And these began to wrestle, and a cloud"
2349,ADMETUS.,"Impenetrable fell, and all was dark."
2350,ADMETUS.,
2351,ADMETUS.,

2355,ADMETUS.,
2356,ADMETUS.,
2357,ADMETUS.,
2358,ADMETUS.,
2359,ADMETUS.,"""Farewell, Admetus and my little son,"
2360,ADMETUS.,"Eumelus,--O these clinging baby hands!"
2361,ADMETUS.,"Thy loss is bitter, for no chance, no fame,"
2362,ADMETUS.,"No wealth of love, can ever compensate"
2363,ADMETUS.,"for a dead mother.  Thou, O king, fulfill"
2364,ADMETUS.,"The double duty: love him with my love,"
2365,ADMETUS.,"And make him bold to wrestle, shiver spears,"
2366,ADMETUS.,"Noble and manly, Grecian to the bone;"
2367,ADMETUS.,And tell him that his mother spake with gods.
2368,ADMETUS.,"Farewell, farewell!  Mine eyes are growing blind:"
2369,ADMETUS.,"The darkness gathers.  O my heart, my heart!"""
2370,ADMETUS.,No sound made answer save the cries of grief
2371,ADMETUS.,"From all the mourners, and the suppliance"
2372,ADMETUS.,"Of strick'n Admetus: ""O have mercy, gods!"
2373,ADMETUS.,"O gods, have mercy, mercy upon us!"""
2374,ADMETUS.,Then from the dying woman's couch again
2375,ADMETUS.,"Her voice was heard, but with strange sudden tones:"
2376,ADMETUS.,"""Lo, I awake--the light comes back to me."
2377,ADMETUS.,"What miracle is this?""  And thunders shook"
2378,ADMETUS.,"The air, and clouds of mighty darkness fell,"
2379,ADMETUS.,"And the earth trembled, and weird, horrid sounds"
2380,ADMETUS.,"Were heard of rushing wings and fleeing feet,"
2381,ADMETUS.,"And groans; and all were silent, dumb with awe,"
2382,ADMETUS.,"Saving the king, who paused not in his prayer:"
2383,ADMETUS.,"""Have mercy, gods!"" and then again, ""O gods,"
2384,ADMETUS.,"Have mercy!"""
2385,ADMETUS.,
2386,ADMETUS.,
2387,ADMETUS.,Through the open casement poured
2388,ADMETUS.,"Bright floods of sunny light; the air was soft,"
2389,ADMETUS.,"Clear, delicate as though a summer storm"
2390,ADMETUS.,"Had passed away; and those there standing saw,"
2391,ADMETUS.,"Afar upon the plain, Death fleeing thence,"
2392,ADMETUS.,"And at the doorway, weary, well-nigh spent,"
2393,ADMETUS.,"Alcides, flushed with victory."

2399,TANNHAUSER.,
2400,TANNHAUSER.,"To my mother.  May, 1870."
2401,TANNHAUSER.,
2402,TANNHAUSER.,
2403,TANNHAUSER.,The Landgrave Hermann held a gathering
2404,TANNHAUSER.,"Of minstrels, minnesingers, troubadours,"
2405,TANNHAUSER.,"At Wartburg in his palace, and the knight,"
2406,TANNHAUSER.,"Sir Tannhauser of France, the greatest bard,"
2407,TANNHAUSER.,"Inspired with heavenly visions, and endowed"
2408,TANNHAUSER.,With apprehension and rare utterance
2409,TANNHAUSER.,"Of noble music, fared in thoughtful wise"
2410,TANNHAUSER.,"Across the Horsel meadows.  Full of light,"
2411,TANNHAUSER.,"And large repose, the peaceful valley lay,"
2412,TANNHAUSER.,"In the late splendor of the afternoon,"
2413,TANNHAUSER.,And level sunbeams lit the serious face
2414,TANNHAUSER.,"Of the young knight, who journeyed to the west,"
2415,TANNHAUSER.,"Towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs,"
2416,TANNHAUSER.,"Scarred, grim, and torn with savage rifts and chasms,"
2417,TANNHAUSER.,That in the distance loomed as soft and fair
2418,TANNHAUSER.,And purple as their shadows on the grass.
2419,TANNHAUSER.,"The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air,"
2420,TANNHAUSER.,"Proclaiming sunset, ushering evening in,"
2421,TANNHAUSER.,Although the sky yet glowed with yellow light.
2422,TANNHAUSER.,"The ploughboy, ere he led his cattle home,"
2423,TANNHAUSER.,"In the near meadow, reverently knelt,"
2424,TANNHAUSER.,"And doffed his cap, and duly crossed his breast,"
2425,TANNHAUSER.,"Whispering his ""Ave Mary,"" as he heard"
2426,TANNHAUSER.,"The pealing vesper-bell.  But still the knight,"
2427,TANNHAUSER.,"Unmindful of the sacred hour announced,"
2428,TANNHAUSER.,"Disdainful or unconscious, held his course."
2429,TANNHAUSER.,"""Would that I also, like yon stupid wight,"
2430,TANNHAUSER.,"Could kneel and hail the Virgin and believe!"""
2431,TANNHAUSER.,He murmured bitterly beneath his breath.
2432,TANNHAUSER.,"""Were I a pagan, riding to contend"
2433,TANNHAUSER.,"For the Olympic wreath, O with what zeal,"
2434,TANNHAUSER.,"What fire of inspiration, would I sing"
2435,TANNHAUSER.,The praises of the gods!  How may my lyre
2436,TANNHAUSER.,Glorify these whose very life I doubt?
2437,TANNHAUSER.,"The world is governed by one cruel God,"
2438,TANNHAUSER.,"Who brings a sword, not peace.  A pallid Christ,"
2439,TANNHAUSER.,"Unnatural, perfect, and a virgin cold,"
2440,TANNHAUSER.,"They give us for a heaven of living gods,"
2441,TANNHAUSER.,"Beautiful, loving, whose mere names were song;"
2442,TANNHAUSER.,"A creed of suffering and despair, walled in"
2443,TANNHAUSER.,"On every side by brazen boundaries,"
2444,TANNHAUSER.,That limit the soul's vision and her hope
2445,TANNHAUSER.,To a red hell or and unpeopled heaven.
2446,TANNHAUSER.,"Yea, I am lost already,--even now"
2447,TANNHAUSER.,Am doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts.
2448,TANNHAUSER.,"O gods! O gods! where shall my soul find peace?"""
2449,TANNHAUSER.,"He raised his wan face to the faded skies,"
2450,TANNHAUSER.,Now shadowing into twilight; no response
2451,TANNHAUSER.,"Came from their sunless heights; no miracle,"
2452,TANNHAUSER.,As in the ancient days of answering gods.
2453,TANNHAUSER.,"With a long, shuddering sigh he glanced to earth,"
2454,TANNHAUSER.,Finding himself among the Horsel cliffs.
2455,TANNHAUSER.,"Gray, sullen, gaunt, they towered on either side;"
2456,TANNHAUSER.,Scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the rifts
2457,TANNHAUSER.,"Of their huge crags, and made small darker spots"
2458,TANNHAUSER.,Upon their wrinkled sides; the jaded horse
2459,TANNHAUSER.,"Stumbled upon loose, rattling, fallen stones,"
2460,TANNHAUSER.,"Amidst the gathering dusk, and blindly fared"
2461,TANNHAUSER.,"Through the weird, perilous pass.  As darkness waxed,"
2462,TANNHAUSER.,And an oppressive mystery enwrapped
2463,TANNHAUSER.,"The roadstead and the rocks, Sir Tannhauser"
2464,TANNHAUSER.,Fancied he saw upon the mountain-side
2465,TANNHAUSER.,The fluttering of white raiment.  With a sense
2466,TANNHAUSER.,"Of wild joy and horror, he gave pause,"
2467,TANNHAUSER.,"For his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat,"
2468,TANNHAUSER.,"Trembling in every limb, confirmed his thought,"
2469,TANNHAUSER.,That nothing human scaled that haunted cliff.
2470,TANNHAUSER.,"The white thing seemed descending,--now a cloud"
2471,TANNHAUSER.,"It looked, and now a rag of drifted mist,"
2472,TANNHAUSER.,"Torn in the jagged gorge precipitous,"
2473,TANNHAUSER.,"And now an apparition clad in white,"
2474,TANNHAUSER.,"Shapely and real,--then he lost it quite,"
2475,TANNHAUSER.,"Gazing on nothing with blank, foolish face."
2476,TANNHAUSER.,"As with wide eyes he stood, he was aware"
2477,TANNHAUSER.,"Of a strange splendor at his very side,"
2478,TANNHAUSER.,"A presence and a majesty so great,"
2479,TANNHAUSER.,"That ere he saw, he felt it was divine."
2480,TANNHAUSER.,"He turned, and, leaping from his horse, fell prone,"
2481,TANNHAUSER.,"In speechless adoration, on the earth,"
2482,TANNHAUSER.,"Before the matchless goddess, who appeared"
2483,TANNHAUSER.,With no less freshness of immortal youth
2484,TANNHAUSER.,Than when first risen from foam of Paphian seas.
2485,TANNHAUSER.,"He heard delicious strains of melody,"
2486,TANNHAUSER.,"Such as his highest muse had ne'er attained,"
2487,TANNHAUSER.,"Float in the air, while in the distance rang,"
2488,TANNHAUSER.,"Harsh and discordant, jarring with those tones,"
2489,TANNHAUSER.,"The gallop of his frightened horse's hoofs,"
2490,TANNHAUSER.,Clattering in sudden freedom down the pass.
2491,TANNHAUSER.,A voice that made all music dissonance
2492,TANNHAUSER.,"Then thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight,"
2493,TANNHAUSER.,"Triumphantly: ""The gods need but appear,"
2494,TANNHAUSER.,"And their usurped thrones are theirs again!"""
2495,TANNHAUSER.,"Then tenderly: ""Sweet knight, I pray thee, rise;"
2496,TANNHAUSER.,"Worship me not, for I desire thy love."
2497,TANNHAUSER.,"Look on me, follow me, for I am fain"
2498,TANNHAUSER.,"Of thy fair, human face.""  He rose and looked,"
2499,TANNHAUSER.,Stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul.
2500,TANNHAUSER.,"Her hair, unbraided and unfilleted,"
2501,TANNHAUSER.,"Rained in a glittering shower to the ground,"
2502,TANNHAUSER.,And cast forth lustre.  Round her zone was clasped
2503,TANNHAUSER.,"The scintillant cestus, stiff with flaming gold,"
2504,TANNHAUSER.,Thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars.
2505,TANNHAUSER.,She might have flung the enchanted wonder forth;
2506,TANNHAUSER.,"Her eyes, her slightest gesture would suffice"
2507,TANNHAUSER.,To bind all men in blissful slavery.
2508,TANNHAUSER.,"She sprang upon the mountain's dangerous side,"
2509,TANNHAUSER.,"With feet that left their print in flowers divine,--"
2510,TANNHAUSER.,"Flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth,"
2511,TANNHAUSER.,"Impurpled amaranth and asphodel,"
2512,TANNHAUSER.,"Dewy with nectar, and exhaling scents"
2513,TANNHAUSER.,Richer than all the roses of mid-June.
2514,TANNHAUSER.,"The knight sped after her, with wild eyes fixed"
2515,TANNHAUSER.,"Upon her brightness, as she lightly leapt"
2516,TANNHAUSER.,"From crag to crag, with flying auburn hair,"
2517,TANNHAUSER.,"Like a gold cloud, that lured him ever on,"
2518,TANNHAUSER.,Higher and higher up the haunted cliff.
2519,TANNHAUSER.,"At last amidst a grove of pines she paused,"
2520,TANNHAUSER.,"Until he reached her, breathing hard with haste,"
2521,TANNHAUSER.,"Delight, and wonder.  Then upon his hand"
2522,TANNHAUSER.,"She placed her own, and all his blood at once"
2523,TANNHAUSER.,"Tingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek,"
2524,TANNHAUSER.,At the supreme caress; but the mere touch
2525,TANNHAUSER.,"Infused fresh life, and when she looked at him"
2526,TANNHAUSER.,"With gracious tenderness, he felt himself"
2527,TANNHAUSER.,Strong suddenly to bear the blinding light
2528,TANNHAUSER.,"Of those great eyes.  ""Dear knight,"" she murmured low,"
2529,TANNHAUSER.,"""For love of me, wilt thou accord this boon,--"
2530,TANNHAUSER.,"To grace my weary home in banishment?"""
2531,TANNHAUSER.,"His hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke,"
2532,TANNHAUSER.,In tones abrupt that startled his own ears
2533,TANNHAUSER.,With their strange harshness; but with thanks profuse
2534,TANNHAUSER.,"She guided him, still holding his cold hand"
2535,TANNHAUSER.,"In her warm, dainty palm, unto a cave,"
2536,TANNHAUSER.,"Whence a rare glory issued, and a smell"
2537,TANNHAUSER.,"Of spice and roses, frankincense and balm."
2538,TANNHAUSER.,"They entering stood within a marble hall,"
2539,TANNHAUSER.,"With straight, slim pillars, at whose farther end"
2540,TANNHAUSER.,The goddess led him to a spiral flight
2541,TANNHAUSER.,"Of stairs, descending always 'midst black gloom"
2542,TANNHAUSER.,Into the very bowels of the earth.
2543,TANNHAUSER.,"Down these, with fearful swiftness, they made way,"
2544,TANNHAUSER.,"The knight's feet touching not the solid stair,"
2545,TANNHAUSER.,"But sliding down as in a vexing dream,"
2546,TANNHAUSER.,"Blind, feeling but that hand divine that still"
2547,TANNHAUSER.,Empowered him to walk on empty air.
2548,TANNHAUSER.,"Then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze,"
2549,TANNHAUSER.,In vast palace filled with reveling folk.
2550,TANNHAUSER.,Cunningly pictured on the ivory walls
2551,TANNHAUSER.,"Were rolling hills, cool lakes, and boscage green,"
2552,TANNHAUSER.,And all the summer landscape's various pomp.
2553,TANNHAUSER.,The precious canopy aloft was carved
2554,TANNHAUSER.,"In semblance of the pleached forest trees,"
2555,TANNHAUSER.,"Enameled with the liveliest green, wherethrough"
2556,TANNHAUSER.,"A light pierced, more resplendent than the day."
2557,TANNHAUSER.,"O'er the pale, polished jasper of the floor"
2558,TANNHAUSER.,"Of burnished metal, fretted and embossed"
2559,TANNHAUSER.,With all the marvelous story of her birth
2560,TANNHAUSER.,"Painted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts,"
2561,TANNHAUSER.,"And carved by heavenly artists,--crystal seas,"
2562,TANNHAUSER.,"And long-haired Nereids in their pearly shells,"
2563,TANNHAUSER.,And all the wonder of her lucent limbs
2564,TANNHAUSER.,Sphered in a vermeil mist.  Upon the throne
2565,TANNHAUSER.,"She took her seat, the knight beside her still,"
2566,TANNHAUSER.,"Singing on couches of fresh asphodel,"
2567,TANNHAUSER.,"And the dance ceased, and the flushed revelers came"
2568,TANNHAUSER.,In glittering phalanx to adore their queen.
2569,TANNHAUSER.,"Beautiful girls, with shining delicate heads,"
2570,TANNHAUSER.,"Crested with living jewels, fanned the air"
2571,TANNHAUSER.,With flickering wings from naked shoulders soft.
2572,TANNHAUSER.,"Then with preluding low, a thousand harps,"
2573,TANNHAUSER.,"And citherns, and strange nameless instruments,"
2574,TANNHAUSER.,"Sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies,"
2575,TANNHAUSER.,"And the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds,"
2576,TANNHAUSER.,With changing lustres like a summer sea.
2577,TANNHAUSER.,"Fair boys, with charming yellow hair crisp-curled,"
2578,TANNHAUSER.,"And frail, effeminate beauty, the knight saw,"
2579,TANNHAUSER.,"But of strong, stalwart men like him were none."
2580,TANNHAUSER.,"He gazed thereon bewitched, until the hand"
2581,TANNHAUSER.,"Of Venus, erst withdrawn, now fell again"
2582,TANNHAUSER.,"Upon his own, and roused him from his trance."
2583,TANNHAUSER.,"He looked on her, and as he looked, a cloud"
2584,TANNHAUSER.,"Auroral, flaming as at sunrising,"
2585,TANNHAUSER.,"Arose from nothing, floating over them"
2586,TANNHAUSER.,"In luminous folds, like that vermilion mist"
2587,TANNHAUSER.,"Penciled upon the throne, and as it waxed"
2588,TANNHAUSER.,"In density and brightness, all the throng"
2589,TANNHAUSER.,"Of festal dancers, less and less distinct,"
2590,TANNHAUSER.,"Grew like pale spirits in a vague, dim dream,"
2591,TANNHAUSER.,"And vanished altogether; and these twain,"
2592,TANNHAUSER.,"Shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud,"
2593,TANNHAUSER.,"Now with a glory inconceivable,"
2594,TANNHAUSER.,"Vivid and conflagrant, looked each on each."
2595,TANNHAUSER.,
2596,TANNHAUSER.,
2597,TANNHAUSER.,All hours came laden with their own delights
2598,TANNHAUSER.,"In that enchanted place, wherein Time"
2599,TANNHAUSER.,"Knew no divisions harsh of night and day,"
2600,TANNHAUSER.,"But light was always, and desire of sleep"
2601,TANNHAUSER.,"Was satisfied at once with slumber soft,"
2602,TANNHAUSER.,"Desire of food with magical repast,"
2603,TANNHAUSER.,By unseen hands on golden tables spread.
2604,TANNHAUSER.,"But these the knight accepted like a god,"
2605,TANNHAUSER.,"All less was lost in that excess of joy,"
2606,TANNHAUSER.,"The crowning marvel of her love for him,"
2607,TANNHAUSER.,Assuring him of his divinity.
2608,TANNHAUSER.,Meanwhile remembrance of the earth appeared
2609,TANNHAUSER.,"Like the vague trouble of a transient dream,--"
2610,TANNHAUSER.,"The doubt, the scruples, the remorse for thoughts"
2611,TANNHAUSER.,"Beyond his own control, the constant thirst"
2612,TANNHAUSER.,"For something fairer than his life, more real"
2613,TANNHAUSER.,Than airy revelations of his Muse.
2614,TANNHAUSER.,Here was his soul's desire satisfied.
2615,TANNHAUSER.,All nobler passions died; his lyre he flung
2616,TANNHAUSER.,"Recklessly forth, with vows to dedicate"
2617,TANNHAUSER.,His being to herself.  She knew and seized
2618,TANNHAUSER.,"The moment of her mastery, and conveyed"
2619,TANNHAUSER.,The lyre beyond his sight and memory.
2620,TANNHAUSER.,"With blandishment divine she changed for him,"
2621,TANNHAUSER.,"Each hour, her mood; a very woman now,"
2622,TANNHAUSER.,"Fantastic, voluble, affectionate,"
2623,TANNHAUSER.,"And jealous of the vague, unbodied air,"
2624,TANNHAUSER.,"Exacting, penitent, and pacified,"
2625,TANNHAUSER.,All in a breath.  And often she appeared
2626,TANNHAUSER.,"Majestic with celestial wrath, with eyes"
2627,TANNHAUSER.,"That shot forth fire, and a heavy brow,"
2628,TANNHAUSER.,"Portentous as the lowering front of heaven,"
2629,TANNHAUSER.,"When the reverberant, sullen thunder rolls"
2630,TANNHAUSER.,Among the echoing clouds.  Thus she denounced
2631,TANNHAUSER.,"Her ancient, fickle worshippers, who left"
2632,TANNHAUSER.,"Her altars desecrate, her fires unfed,"
2633,TANNHAUSER.,"Her name forgotten.  ""But I reign, I reign!"""
2634,TANNHAUSER.,"She would shrill forth, triumphant; ""yea, I reign."
2635,TANNHAUSER.,"Men name me not, but worship me unnamed,"
2636,TANNHAUSER.,Beauty and Love within their heart of hearts;
2637,TANNHAUSER.,"Not with bent knees and empty breath of words,"
2638,TANNHAUSER.,"But with devoted sacrifice of lives."""
2639,TANNHAUSER.,"Then melting in a moment, she would weep"
2640,TANNHAUSER.,"Ambrosial tears, pathetic, full of guile,"
2641,TANNHAUSER.,"Accusing her own base ingratitude,"
2642,TANNHAUSER.,"In craving worship, when she had his heart,"
2643,TANNHAUSER.,"Her priceless knight, her peerless paladin,"
2644,TANNHAUSER.,"Her Tannhauser; then, with an artful glance"
2645,TANNHAUSER.,"Of lovely helplessness, entreated him"
2646,TANNHAUSER.,"Not to desert her, like the faithless world,"
2647,TANNHAUSER.,"For these unbeautiful and barbarous gods,"
2648,TANNHAUSER.,"Or she would never cease her prayers to Jove,"
2649,TANNHAUSER.,Until he took from her the heavy curse
2650,TANNHAUSER.,"Of immortality.  With closer vows,"
2651,TANNHAUSER.,The knight then sealed his worship and forswore
2652,TANNHAUSER.,All other aims and deeds to serve her cause.
2653,TANNHAUSER.,Thus passed unnoted seven barren years
2654,TANNHAUSER.,"Of reckless passion and voluptuous sloth,"
2655,TANNHAUSER.,Undignified by any lofty thought
2656,TANNHAUSER.,"In his degraded mind, that sometime was"
2657,TANNHAUSER.,Endowed with noble capability.
2658,TANNHAUSER.,"From revelry to revelry he passed,"
2659,TANNHAUSER.,"Craving more pungent pleasure momently,"
2660,TANNHAUSER.,"And new intoxications, and each hour"
2661,TANNHAUSER.,The siren goddess answered his desires.
2662,TANNHAUSER.,Once when she left him with a weary sense
2663,TANNHAUSER.,"Of utter lassitude, he sat alone,"
2664,TANNHAUSER.,"And, raising listless eyes, he saw himself"
2665,TANNHAUSER.,"In a great burnished mirror, wrought about"
2666,TANNHAUSER.,With cunning imagery of twisted vines.
2667,TANNHAUSER.,"He scarcely knew those sunken, red-rimmed eyes,"
2668,TANNHAUSER.,For his who in the flush of manhood rode
2669,TANNHAUSER.,"Among the cliffs, and followed up the crags"
2670,TANNHAUSER.,The flying temptress; and there fell on him
2671,TANNHAUSER.,"A horror of her beauty, a disgust"
2672,TANNHAUSER.,"For his degenerate and corrupted life,"
2673,TANNHAUSER.,"With irresistible, intense desire,"
2674,TANNHAUSER.,To feel the breath of heaven on his face.
2675,TANNHAUSER.,"Then as Fate willed, who rules above the gods,"
2676,TANNHAUSER.,"He saw, within the glass, behind him glide"
2677,TANNHAUSER.,"The form of Venus.  Certain of her power,"
2678,TANNHAUSER.,"She had laid by, in fond security,"
2679,TANNHAUSER.,"The enchanted cestus, and Sir Tannhauser,"
2680,TANNHAUSER.,"With surfeited regard, beheld her now,"
2681,TANNHAUSER.,"No fairer than the women of the earth,"
2682,TANNHAUSER.,"Whom with serenity and health he left,"
2683,TANNHAUSER.,"Duped by a lovely witch.  Before he moved,"
2684,TANNHAUSER.,"She knew her destiny; and when he turned,"
2685,TANNHAUSER.,"He seemed to drop a mask, disclosing thus"
2686,TANNHAUSER.,"An alien face, and eyes with vision true,"
2687,TANNHAUSER.,That for long time with glamour had been blind.
2688,TANNHAUSER.,"Hiding the hideous rage within her breast,"
2689,TANNHAUSER.,"With girlish simpleness of folded hands,"
2690,TANNHAUSER.,"Auroral blushes, and sweet, shamefast mien,"
2691,TANNHAUSER.,"She spoke: ""Behold, my love, I have cast forth"
2692,TANNHAUSER.,"All magic, blandishments and sorcery,"
2693,TANNHAUSER.,"For I have dreamed a dream so terrible,"
2694,TANNHAUSER.,That I awoke to find my pillow stained
2695,TANNHAUSER.,"With tears as of real woe.  I thought my belt,"
2696,TANNHAUSER.,"By Vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power,"
2697,TANNHAUSER.,"Was the sole bond between us; this being doffed,"
2698,TANNHAUSER.,"I seemed to thee an old, unlovely crone,"
2699,TANNHAUSER.,Wrinkled by every year that I have seen.
2700,TANNHAUSER.,"Thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer,"
2701,TANNHAUSER.,"So that I woke with weeping.  Then I rose,"
2702,TANNHAUSER.,"And drew the glittering girdle from my zone,"
2703,TANNHAUSER.,"Jealous thereof, yet full of fears, and said,"
2704,TANNHAUSER.,"'If it be this he loves, then let him go!"
2705,TANNHAUSER.,"I have no solace as a mortal hath,"
2706,TANNHAUSER.,No hope of change or death to comfort me
2707,TANNHAUSER.,"Through all eternity; yet he is free,"
2708,TANNHAUSER.,"Though I could hold him fast with heavy chains,"
2709,TANNHAUSER.,Bound in perpetual imprisonment.'
2710,TANNHAUSER.,Tell me my vision was a baseless dream;
2711,TANNHAUSER.,"See, I am kneeling, and kiss thy hands,--"
2712,TANNHAUSER.,"In pity, look on me, before thy word"
2713,TANNHAUSER.,"Condemns me to immortal misery!"""
2714,TANNHAUSER.,"As she looked down, the infernal influence"
2715,TANNHAUSER.,Worked on his soul again; for she was fair
2716,TANNHAUSER.,"Beyond imagination, and her brow"
2717,TANNHAUSER.,Seemed luminous with high self-sacrifice.
2718,TANNHAUSER.,"He bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,"
2719,TANNHAUSER.,"With its close-curling gold, and love revived."
2720,TANNHAUSER.,
2721,TANNHAUSER.,"But ere he spoke, he heard the distant sound"
2722,TANNHAUSER.,"Of one sweet, smitten lyre, and a gleam"
2723,TANNHAUSER.,Of violent anger flashed across the face
2724,TANNHAUSER.,Upraised to his in feigned simplicity
2725,TANNHAUSER.,"And singleness of purpose.  Then he sprang,"
2726,TANNHAUSER.,"Well-nigh a god himself, with sudden strength"
2727,TANNHAUSER.,"to vanquish and resist, beyond her reach,"
2728,TANNHAUSER.,"Crying, ""My old Muse calls me, and I hear!"
2729,TANNHAUSER.,Thy fateful vision is no baseless dream;
2730,TANNHAUSER.,"I will be gone from this accursed hall!"""
2731,TANNHAUSER.,"Then she, too, rose, dilating over him,"
2732,TANNHAUSER.,"And sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs,"
2733,TANNHAUSER.,"Unto her girdle, and her head appeared"
2734,TANNHAUSER.,"Refulgent, and her voice rang wrathfully:"
2735,TANNHAUSER.,"""Have I cajoled and flattered thee till now,"
2736,TANNHAUSER.,To lose thee thus!  How wilt thou make escape?
2737,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:
2738,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Yea, not my love, but my poor slave and fool."""
2739,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"But he, with both hands pressed upon his eyes,"
2740,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Against that blinding lustre, heeded not"
2741,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Her thundered words, and cried in sharp despair,"
2742,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"""Help me, O Virgin Mary! and thereat,"
2743,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The very bases of the hall gave way,"
2744,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The roof was rived, the goddess disappeared,"
2745,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And Tannhauser stood free upon the cliff,"
2746,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air.
2747,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,
2748,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,
2749,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Around him were the tumbled blocks and crags,"
2750,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks,"
2751,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Black caves, and masses of the grim, bald rock."
2752,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The ethereal, unfathomable sky,"
2753,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Hung over him, the valley lay beneath,"
2754,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Dotted with yellow hayricks, that exhaled"
2755,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Sweet, healthy odors to the mountain-top."
2756,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He breathed intoxicate the infinite air,"
2757,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And plucked the heather blossoms where they blew,"
2758,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Reckless with light and dew, in crannies green,"
2759,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And scarcely saw their darling bells for tears.
2760,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,No sounds of labor reached him from the farms
2761,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And hamlets trim, nor from the furrowed glebe;"
2762,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"But a serene and sabbath stillness reigned,"
2763,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Till broken by the faint, melodious chimes"
2764,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Of the small village church that called to prayer.
2765,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He hurried down the rugged, scarped cliff,"
2766,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And swung himself from shelving granite slopes
2767,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"To narrow foot-holds, near wide-throated chasms,"
2768,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands,"
2769,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"With long hair flying from his dripping brow,"
2770,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Uncovered head, and white, exalted face."
2771,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"No memory had he of his smooth ascent,"
2772,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,No thought of fear upon those dreadful hills;
2773,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He only heard the bell, inviting him"
2774,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"To satisfy the craving of his heart,"
2775,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,For worship 'midst his fellow men.  He reached
2776,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The beaten, dusty road, and passed thereon"
2777,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The pious peasants faring towards the church,"
2778,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And scarce refrained from greeting them like friends
2779,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Dearly beloved, after long absence met."
2780,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"How more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked,"
2781,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"In their rough, homespun gowns and coifs demure,"
2782,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"After the beauty of bare, rosy limbs,"
2783,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And odorous, loose hair!  He noted not"
2784,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Suspicious glances on his garb uncouth,"
2785,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"His air extravagant and face distraught,"
2786,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"With bursts of laughter from the red-cheeked boys,"
2787,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And prudent crossings of the women's breasts.
2788,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He passed the flowering close about the church,"
2789,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And trod the well worn-path, with throbbing heart,"
2790,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The little heather-bell between his lips,"
2791,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And his eyes fastened on the good green grass.
2792,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Thus entered he the sanctuary, lit"
2793,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"With frequent tapers, and with sunbeams stained"
2794,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Through painted glass.  How pure and innocent
2795,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The waiting congregation seemed to him,"
2796,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Kneeling, or seated with calm brows upraised!"
2797,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"With faltering strength, he cowered down alone,"
2798,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And held sincere communion with the Lord,"
2799,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"For one brief moment, in a sudden gush"
2800,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Of blessed tears.  The minister of God
2801,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Rose to invoke a blessing on his flock,"
2802,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And then began the service,--not in words"
2803,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"To raise the lowly, and to heal the sick,"
2804,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"But an alien tongue, with phrases formed,"
2805,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And meaningless observances.  The knight,"
2806,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Unmoved, yet thirsting for the simple word"
2807,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"That might have moved him, held his bitter thoughts,"
2808,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"But when in his own speech a new priest spake,"
2809,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Looked up with hope revived, and heard the text:"
2810,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"""Go, preach the Gospel unto all the world."
2811,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He that believes and is baptized, is saved."
2812,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He that believeth not, is damned in hell!"""
2813,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,He sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes;
2814,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,The crowded congregation disappeared;
2815,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He felt alone in some black sea of hell,"
2816,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"While a great light smote one exalted face,"
2817,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Vivid already with prophetic fire,"
2818,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom.
2819,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He longed in that void circle to cry out,"
2820,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"With one clear shriek, but sense and voice seemed bound,"
2821,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,And his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth.
2822,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"As the last words resounded through the church,"
2823,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And once again the pastor blessed his flock,"
2824,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Who, serious and subdued, passed slowly down"
2825,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The arrow aisle, none noted, near the wall,"
2826,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"A fallen man with face upon his knees,"
2827,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"A heap of huddled garments and loose hair,"
2828,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Unconscious 'mid the rustling, murmurous stir,"
2829,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"'Midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers,"
2830,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Let in athwart the doorway.  One lone priest,"
2831,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Darkening the altar lights, moved noiselessly,"
2832,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Now with the yellow glow upon his face,"
2833,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Now a black shadow gliding farther on,"
2834,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Amidst the smooth, slim pillars of hewn ash."
2835,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,But from the vacant aisles he heard at once
2836,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"A hollow sigh, heaved from a depth profound."
2837,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Upholding his last light above his head,"
2838,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And peering eagerly amidst the stalls,"
2839,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"He cried, ""Be blest who cometh in God's name."""
2840,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Then the gaunt form of Tannhauser arose.
2841,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"""Father, I am a sinner, and I seek"
2842,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Forgiveness and help, by whatso means"

2846,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"'Will I not make them white as wool?'  Confess,"
2847,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And I will shrive you.""  Thus the good priest moved"
2848,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Towards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand.
2849,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"But shrinking down, he drew his fingers back"
2850,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"From the kind palm, and kissed the friar's feet."
2851,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"""Thy pure hand is anointed, and can heal."
2852,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The cool, calm pressure brings back sanity,"
2853,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"And what serene, past joys! yet touch me not,"
2854,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"My contact is pollution,--hear, O hear,"
2855,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"While I disburden my charged soul.""  He lay,"

2869,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"I was a knight and bard, with such a gift"
2870,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,Of revelation that no hour of life
2871,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"Lacked beauty and adornment, in myself"
2872,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,The seat and centre of all happiness.
2873,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,What inspiration could my lofty Muse

2884,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The restless nights of feverish sleeplessness,"

2886,ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:,"The dawn that brought no hope nor energy,"

3851,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In scenes like this, as when my pulse danced high,"
3852,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And youth coursed through my veins!  This the one link
3853,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That binds the wan old man that now I am
3854,SAINT ROMUALDO.,To the wild lad who followed up the hounds
3855,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Among Ravenna's pine-woods by the sea.
3856,SAINT ROMUALDO.,For there how oft would I lose all delight
3857,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In the pursuit, the triumph, or the game,"
3858,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"To stray alone among the shadowy glades,"
3859,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And gaze, as one who is not satisfied"
3860,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"With gazing, at the large, bright, breathing sea,"
3861,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The forest glooms, and shifting gleams between"
3862,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees,"
3863,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"On gold-green turf, sweet-brier, and wild pink rose!"
3864,SAINT ROMUALDO.,How rich that buoyant air with changing scent
3865,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of pungent pine, fresh flowers, and salt cool seas!"
3866,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And when all echoes of the chase had died,"
3867,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of horn and halloo, bells and baying hounds,"
3868,SAINT ROMUALDO.,How mine ears drank the ripple of the tide
3869,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"On the fair shore, the chirp of unseen birds,"
3870,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The rustling of the tangled undergrowth,"
3871,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And the deep lyric murmur of the pines,"
3872,SAINT ROMUALDO.,When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze!
3873,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"There was my world, there would my heart dilate,"
3874,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And my aspiring soul dissolve in prayer
3875,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Unto that Spirit of Love whose energies
3876,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Were active round me, yet whose presence, sphered"
3877,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In the unsearchable, unbodied air,"
3878,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Made itself felt, but reigned invisible."
3879,SAINT ROMUALDO.,This ere the day that made me what I am.
3880,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Still can I see the hot, bright sky, the sea"
3881,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Illimitably sparkling, as they showed"
3882,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That morning.  Though I deemed I took no note
3883,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of heaven or earth or waters, yet my mind"
3884,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Retains to-day the vivid portraiture
3885,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Of every line and feature of the scene.
3886,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Light-hearted 'midst the dewy lanes I fared
3887,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Unto the sea, whose jocund gleam I caught"
3888,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Between the slim boles, when I heard the clink"
3889,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of naked weapons, then a sudden thrust"
3890,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Sickening to hear, and then a stifled groan;"
3891,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And pressing forward I beheld the sight
3892,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That seared itself for ever on my brain--
3893,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"My kinsman, Ser Ranieri, on the turf,"
3894,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Fallen upon his side, his bright young head"
3895,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Among the pine-spurs, and his cheek pressed close"
3896,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Unto the moist, chill sod: his fingers clutched"
3897,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"A handful of loose weeds and grass and earth,"
3898,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Uprooted in his anguish as he fell,"
3899,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed,"
3900,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Fouling the green, leaving the fair, sweet face"
3901,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Ghastly, transparent, with blue, stony eyes"
3902,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Staring in blankness on that other one
3903,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Who triumphed over him.  With hot desire
3904,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Of instant vengeance I unsheathed my sword
3905,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"To rush upon the slayer, when he turned"
3906,SAINT ROMUALDO.,In his first terror of blood-guiltiness.
3907,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3908,SAINT ROMUALDO.,.  .  .  .  .  .  .
3909,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3910,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Within my heart a something snapped and brake.
3911,SAINT ROMUALDO.,What was it but the chord of rapturous joy
3912,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"For ever stilled?  I tottered and would fall,"
3913,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Had I not leaned against the friendly pine;
3914,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"For all realities of life, unmoored"
3915,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"From their firm anchorage, appeared to float"
3916,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Like hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain.
3917,SAINT ROMUALDO.,The strange delusion wrought upon my soul
3918,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That this had been enacted ages since.
3919,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"This very horror curdled at my heart,"
3920,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"This net of trees spread round, these iron heavens,"
3921,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Were closing over me when I had stood,"
3922,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Unnumbered cycles back, and fronted HIM,"
3923,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"My father; and he felt mine eyes as now,"
3924,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Yet saw me not; and then, as now, that form,"
3925,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The one thing real, lay stretched between us both."
3926,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The fancy passed, and I stood sane and strong"
3927,SAINT ROMUALDO.,To grasp the truth.  Then I remembered all--
3928,SAINT ROMUALDO.,A few fierce words between them yester eve
3929,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Concerning some poor plot of pasturage,"
3930,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Soon silenced into courteous, frigid calm:"
3931,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"This was the end.  I could not meet him now,"
3932,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"To curse him, to accuse him, or to save,"
3933,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And draw him from the red entanglement
3934,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Coiled by his own hands round his ruined life.
3935,SAINT ROMUALDO.,God pardon me!  My heart that moment held
3936,SAINT ROMUALDO.,No drop of pity toward this wretched soul;
3937,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And cowering down, as though his guilt were mine,"
3938,SAINT ROMUALDO.,I fled amidst the savage silences
3939,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of that grim wood, resolved to nurse alone"
3940,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"My boundless desolation, shame, and grief."
3941,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3942,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3943,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"There, in that thick-leaved twilight of high noon,"
3944,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The quiet of the still, suspended air,"
3945,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged,"
3946,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Shepherded by my will.  I wept, I prayed"
3947,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"A solemn prayer, conceived in agony,"
3948,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Blessed with response instant, miraculous;"
3949,SAINT ROMUALDO.,For in that hour my spirit was at one
3950,SAINT ROMUALDO.,With Him who knows and satisfies her needs.
3951,SAINT ROMUALDO.,The supplication and the blessing sprang
3952,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"From the same source, inspired divinely both."
3953,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"I prayed for light, self-knowledge, guidance, truth,"
3954,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And these like heavenly manna were rained down
3955,SAINT ROMUALDO.,To feed my hungered soul.  His guilt was mine.
3956,SAINT ROMUALDO.,What angel had been sent to stay mine arm
3957,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Until the fateful moment passed away
3958,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That would have ushered an eternity
3959,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Of withering remorse?  I found the germs
3960,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In mine own heart of every human sin,"
3961,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That waited but occasion's tempting breath
3962,SAINT ROMUALDO.,To overgrow with poisoned bloom my life.
3963,SAINT ROMUALDO.,What God thus far had saved me from myself?
3964,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Here was the lofty truth revealed, that each"
3965,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Must feel himself in all, must know where'er"
3966,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The great soul acts or suffers or enjoys,"
3967,SAINT ROMUALDO.,His proper soul in kinship there is bound.
3968,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Then my life-purpose dawned upon my mind,"
3969,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Encouraging as morning.  As I lay,"
3970,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Crushed by the weight of universal love,"
3971,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself,"
3972,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"I heard the clear chime of a slow, sweet bell."
3973,SAINT ROMUALDO.,I knew it--whence it came and what it sang.
3974,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed,"
3975,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"And called the monks to prayer.  Vigil and prayer,"
3976,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Clean lives, white days of strict austerity:"
3977,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Such were the offerings of these holy saints.
3978,SAINT ROMUALDO.,How far might such not tend to expiate
3979,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"A riotous world's indulgence?  Here my life,"
3980,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Doubly austere and doubly sanctified,"
3981,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Might even for that other one atone,"
3982,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"So bound to mine, till both should be forgiven."
3983,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3984,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
3985,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"They sheltered me, not questioning the need"
3986,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That led me to their cloistered solitude.
3987,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"How rich, how freighted with pure influence,"
3988,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"With dear security of perfect peace,"
3989,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Was the first day I passed within those walls!
3990,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The holy habit of perpetual prayer,"
3991,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The gentle greetings, the rare temperate speech,"
3992,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The chastening discipline, the atmosphere"
3993,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of settled and profound tranquillity,"
3994,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Were even as living waters unto one
3995,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Who perisheth of thirst.  Was this the world
3996,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That yesterday seemed one huge battlefield
3997,SAINT ROMUALDO.,For brutish passions?  Could the soul of man
3998,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Withdraw so easily, and erect apart"
3999,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Her own fair temple for her own high ends?
4000,SAINT ROMUALDO.,But this serene contentment slowly waned
4001,SAINT ROMUALDO.,As I discerned the broad disparity
4002,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Betwixt the form and spirit of the laws
4003,SAINT ROMUALDO.,That bound the order in strait brotherhood.
4004,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Yet when I sought to gain a larger love,"
4005,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"More rigid discipline, severer truth,"
4006,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And more complete surrender of the soul
4007,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Unto her God, this was to my reproach,"
4008,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides.
4009,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In mine own cell I mortified my flesh,"
4010,SAINT ROMUALDO.,I held aloof from all my brethren's feasts
4011,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"To wrestle with my viewless enemies,"
4012,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Till they should leave their blessing on my head;
4013,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"For nightly was I haunted by that face,"
4014,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"White, bloodless, as I saw it 'midst the ferns,"
4015,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Now staring out of darkness, and it held"
4016,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Mine eyes from slumber and my brain from rest
4017,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And drove me from my straw to weep and pray.
4018,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wrought
4019,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Upon my spirit that I lay day-long
4020,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In dumb despair, until the blessed hope"
4021,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Of mercy dawned again upon my soul,"
4022,SAINT ROMUALDO.,As gradual as the slow gold moon that mounts
4023,SAINT ROMUALDO.,The airy steps of heaven.  My faith arose
4024,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"With sure perception that disaster, wrong,"
4025,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And every shadow of man's destiny
4026,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Are merely circumstance, and cannot touch"
4027,SAINT ROMUALDO.,The soul's fine essence: they exist or die
4028,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Only as she affirms them or denies.
4029,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
4030,SAINT ROMUALDO.,
4031,SAINT ROMUALDO.,This faith sustain me even to the end:
4032,SAINT ROMUALDO.,It floods my heart with peace as surely now
4033,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"As on that day the friars drove me forth,"
4034,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Urging that my asceticism, too harsh,"
4035,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Endured through pride, would bring into reproach"
4036,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Their customs and their order.  Then began
4037,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"My exile in the mountains, where I bode"
4038,SAINT ROMUALDO.,A hunted man.  The elements conspired
4039,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Against me, and I was the seasons' sport,"
4040,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Drenched, parched, and scorched and frozen alternately,"
4041,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Burned with shrewd frosts, prostrated by fierce heats,"
4042,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Shivering 'neath chilling dews and gusty rains,"
4043,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And buffeted by all the winds of heaven.
4044,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Yet was this period my time of joy:
4045,SAINT ROMUALDO.,My daily thoughts perpetual converse held
4046,SAINT ROMUALDO.,With angels ministrant; mine ears were charmed
4047,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"With sweet accordance of celestial sounds,"
4048,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Song, harp and choir, clear ringing through the air."
4049,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And visions were revealed unto mine eyes
4050,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"By night and day of Heaven's very courts,"
4051,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"In shadowless, undimmed magnificence."
4052,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"I gave God thanks, not that He sheltered me,"
4053,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air--
4054,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"For had I perished, this too had been well--"
4055,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"But for the revelation of His truth,"
4056,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The glory, the beatitude vouchsafed"
4057,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"To exalt, to heal, to quicken, to inspire;"
4058,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"So that the pinched, lean excommunicate"
4059,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Was crowned with joy more solid, more secure,"
4060,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Than all the comfort of the vales could bring.
4061,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts,"
4062,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Aspiring toward His love, to come to me,"
4063,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Timid and few at first; but as they heard
4064,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"From mine own lips the precious oracles,"
4065,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"That soothed the trouble of their souls, appeased"
4066,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Their spiritual hunger, and disclosed"
4067,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"All of the God within them to themselves,"
4068,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"They flocked about me, and they hailed me saint,"
4069,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And sware to follow and to serve the good
4070,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Which my word published and my life declared.
4071,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Thus the lone hermit of the mountain-top
4072,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Descended leader of a band of saints,"
4073,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And midway 'twixt the summit and the vale
4074,SAINT ROMUALDO.,I perched my convent.  Yet I bated not
4075,SAINT ROMUALDO.,One whit of strict restraint and abstinence.
4076,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And they who love me and who serve the truth
4077,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"Have learned to suffer with me, and have won"
4078,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"The supreme joy that is not of the flesh,"
4079,SAINT ROMUALDO.,Foretasting the delights of Paradise.
4080,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"This faith, to them imparted, will endure"
4081,SAINT ROMUALDO.,"After my tongue hath ceased to utter it,"
4082,SAINT ROMUALDO.,And the great peace hath settled on my soul.

6827,MARIA.,Father from daughter.  Now you are all mine own.
6828,MARIA.,And now--your secret.
6829,MARIA.,
6830,MARIA.,
6831,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6832,RIBERA.,Mine?  'T is none of mine;
6833,RIBERA.,"'T is thine, Maria.  John of Austria"
6834,RIBERA.,Desires our presence at his ball to-night.
6835,RIBERA.,

6837,MARIA.,MARIA.
6838,MARIA.,Prince John?
6839,MARIA.,
6840,MARIA.,
6841,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6842,RIBERA.,"Ay, girl, Prince John.  I looked to see"
6843,RIBERA.,A haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyes
6844,RIBERA.,And burn upon thy cheek.  But what is this?
6845,RIBERA.,"Timid and pale, thou droop'st thy head abashed"
6846,RIBERA.,As a poor flower-girl whom a lord accosts.
6847,RIBERA.,
6848,RIBERA.,
6849,MARIA.,MARIA.
6850,MARIA.,"Forgive me.  Sure, 't is you Don John desires"

6852,MARIA.,
6853,MARIA.,
6854,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6855,RIBERA.,Art!  Prate not of art!
6856,RIBERA.,Think'st thou I move an artist 'midst his guests?
6857,RIBERA.,As such I commune with a loftier race;
6858,RIBERA.,Angels and spirits are my ministers.
6859,RIBERA.,These do I part aside to grace his halls;
6860,RIBERA.,"A Spanish gentleman--and so, his peer."
6861,RIBERA.,
6862,RIBERA.,
6863,MARIA.,MARIA.
6864,MARIA.,"Father, I am not well; my head throbs fast,"
6865,MARIA.,Unwonted languor weighs upon my frame.
6866,MARIA.,
6867,MARIA.,
6868,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6869,RIBERA.,"Anger me not, Maria.  'T is my will,"
6870,RIBERA.,"Thou shalt obey.  Hell, what these women be!"
6871,RIBERA.,No obstacle would daunt them in the quest
6872,RIBERA.,"Of that which, freely given, they reject."
6873,RIBERA.,Hold!  Haply just occasion bids thee seem
6874,RIBERA.,Unlike thyself.  Speak fearlessly child;
6875,RIBERA.,"Confide to me thy knowledge, thy surmise."
6876,RIBERA.,
6877,RIBERA.,
6878,RIBERA.,MARIA (hurriedly).
6879,RIBERA.,"No, father, you were right.  I have no cause;"
6880,RIBERA.,"Punish me--nay, forgive, and I obey."
6881,RIBERA.,
6882,RIBERA.,
6883,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6884,RIBERA.,There spake my child; kiss me and be forgiven.
6885,RIBERA.,Sometimes I doubt thou playest upon my love
6886,RIBERA.,"Willfully, knowing me as soft as clay,"
6887,RIBERA.,"Whom the world knows of marble.  In such moods,"
6888,RIBERA.,"I see my spirit mirror's first, and then"
6889,RIBERA.,From thy large eyes thy sainted mother's soul
6890,RIBERA.,Unclouded shine.
6891,RIBERA.,
6892,RIBERA.,
6893,MARIA.,MARIA.
6894,MARIA.,Can I be like to her?
6895,MARIA.,"I only knew her faded, white, and grave,"
6896,MARIA.,"And so she still floats vaguely through my dreams,"
6897,MARIA.,"With eyes like your own angels', and a brow"
6898,MARIA.,Worthy an aureole.
6899,MARIA.,
6900,MARIA.,
6901,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6902,RIBERA.,"An earthly crown,"
6903,RIBERA.,"My princess, might more fitly rest on thine."
6904,RIBERA.,"Annicca hath her colors, blue-black hair,"
6905,RIBERA.,"And pale, brown flesh, and gray, untroubled eyes;"
6906,RIBERA.,"Yet thou more often bring'st her to mind,"
6907,RIBERA.,"For all the tawny gold of thy thick locks,"
6908,RIBERA.,"Thy rare white face, and brilliant Spanish orbs."
6909,RIBERA.,"Thine is her lisping trick of voice, her laugh,"
6910,RIBERA.,The blithest music still this side of heaven;
6911,RIBERA.,"Thine her free, springing gait, though therewithal"
6912,RIBERA.,"A swaying, languid motion all thine own,"
6913,RIBERA.,Recalls Valencia more than Italy.
6914,RIBERA.,"Like and unlike thou art to her, as still"
6915,RIBERA.,"My memory loves to hold her, as she first"
6916,RIBERA.,Beamed like the star of morning on my life.
6917,RIBERA.,"Hot, faint, and footsore, I had paced since dawn"
6918,RIBERA.,"The sun-baked streets of Naples, seeking work,"
6919,RIBERA.,"Not alms, despite the beggar that I looked."
6920,RIBERA.,"Now 't was nigh vespers, and my suit had met"
6921,RIBERA.,"With curt refusal, sharp rebuff, and gibes."
6922,RIBERA.,Praised be the saints! for every drop of gall
6923,RIBERA.,"In that day's brimming cup, I have upheld"
6924,RIBERA.,A poisoned beaker to another's lips.
6925,RIBERA.,Many a one hath the Ribera taught
6926,RIBERA.,To fare a vagabond through alien streets;
6927,RIBERA.,"A god unrecognized 'midst churls and clowns,"
6928,RIBERA.,"With kindled soul aflame, and body faint"
6929,RIBERA.,"Or lack of bread.  Domenichino knows,"
6930,RIBERA.,"And Gessi, Guido, Annibal Caracci--"

6932,RIBERA.,
6933,MARIA.,MARIA.
6934,MARIA.,"Dear father, calm yourself.  You had begun"

6936,MARIA.,
6937,MARIA.,
6938,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6939,RIBERA.,"True, I forgot it not.  Why, I AM calm;"
6940,RIBERA.,"The old man now can well be grave and cold,"
6941,RIBERA.,"Or laugh at his own youth's indignities,"
6942,RIBERA.,"Past a long lifetime back.  'T was vespers' hour,"
6943,RIBERA.,"Or nigh it, when I reached her father's door."
6944,RIBERA.,"Kind was his greeting, the first cordial words"
6945,RIBERA.,I heard in Naples; but I took small heed
6946,RIBERA.,"Of speech or toe, for all my sense was rapt"
6947,RIBERA.,In wonder at the angel by his side
6948,RIBERA.,"Who smiled upon me.  Large, clear eyes that held"
6949,RIBERA.,The very soul of sunlight in their depths;
6950,RIBERA.,"Low, pure, pale brow, with masses of black hair"
6951,RIBERA.,"Flung loosely back, and rippling unconfined"
6952,RIBERA.,In shadowy magnificence below
6953,RIBERA.,The slim gold girdle o'er the snow-soft gown.
6954,RIBERA.,"Vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists,"
6955,RIBERA.,A stately lily ere the dew of morn
6956,RIBERA.,"Hath passed away--such was thy mother, child."
6957,RIBERA.,
6958,RIBERA.,
6959,MARIA.,MARIA.
6960,MARIA.,"Would I were like her!  But what said she, father?"
6961,MARIA.,How did she plead for you?
6962,MARIA.,
6963,MARIA.,
6964,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6965,RIBERA.,"Ah, cunning child,"
6966,RIBERA.,"I see thy tricks; thou humorest my age,"
6967,RIBERA.,"Knowing how much I love to tell this tale,"

6976,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
6977,RIBERA.,"'T was to pleasure her,"
6978,RIBERA.,Signor Cortese gave me all I lacked
6979,RIBERA.,"To prove my unfamed skill.  A savage pride,"
6980,RIBERA.,"Matched oddly with my rags, the haughtiness"
6981,RIBERA.,"Wherewith I claimed rather than begged my tools,"
6982,RIBERA.,"And my quaint aspect, oft she told me since,"
6983,RIBERA.,"Won at a glance her faith.  Before I left,"
6984,RIBERA.,"She guessed my need, and served me meat and wine"
6985,RIBERA.,With  her own flower-white hands.  The parting grace
6986,RIBERA.,"I craved was granted, that my work might be"
6987,RIBERA.,The portrait of herself.  Thou knowest the rest.

6989,RIBERA.,
6990,MARIA.,MARIA.
6991,MARIA.,"Why did she leave us, father?  Oh, how oft"
6992,MARIA.,"I yearn to see her face, to hear her voice,"
6993,MARIA.,"Hushed in an endless silence!  Strange that she,"
6994,MARIA.,"Whose rich love beggared our return, should bear"
6995,MARIA.,Such separation!  Though engirdled now
6996,MARIA.,"By heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim,"
6997,MARIA.,"I cannot fancy it.  What! shall her child,"
6998,MARIA.,"Whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart,"
6999,MARIA.,Have need of her and cry to her in vain?
7000,MARIA.,
7001,MARIA.,
7002,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
7003,RIBERA.,"Now, for God's sake, Maria, speak not thus;"
7004,RIBERA.,Let me not see such tears upon thy cheek.
7005,RIBERA.,Not unto us it has been given to guess
7006,RIBERA.,The peace of disembodied souls like hers.
7007,RIBERA.,The vanishing glimpses that my fancies catch
7008,RIBERA.,"Through heaven's half-opened gates, exalt even me,"
7009,RIBERA.,"Poor sinner that I am.  And what are these,"
7010,RIBERA.,The painted shadows that make all my life
7011,RIBERA.,"A glory, to the splendor of that light?"
7012,RIBERA.,"For thee, my child, has not my doting love"
7013,RIBERA.,"Sufficed, at least in part, to fill the breach"
7014,RIBERA.,Of that tremendous void?  What dost thou lack?
7015,RIBERA.,"What help, what counsel, what most dear caress?"
7016,RIBERA.,What dost thou covet?  What least whim remains

7020,MARIA.,MARIA.
7021,MARIA.,"None, none, dear father!  Pardon me!  Thy love,"

7023,MARIA.,To merit or repay.  Fie o my lips!
7024,MARIA.,Look if they be not blistered.  Let them smooth
7025,MARIA.,With contrite kisses the last frown away.
7026,MARIA.,We must be young to-night--no wrinkles then!

7031,RIBERA.,Thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways.
7032,RIBERA.,"I had forgot the ball.  Yea, I grow old;"

7034,RIBERA.,Once I had thought it play to dream all day
7035,RIBERA.,"Before my canvas and then dance till dawn,"

7053,RIBERA.,Humph! the design is not so ill-conceived;
7054,RIBERA.,I note some progress; but your drawing's bad--
7055,RIBERA.,"Yes, bad, sir.  Mark you how this leg hangs limp,"

7057,RIBERA.,"Not loosely clasped, as you intended them."
7058,RIBERA.,[He takes his pencil and makes a few strokes.

7300,ANNICCA.,
7301,ANNICCA.,MARIA (starting).
7302,ANNICCA.,Annicca!
7303,ANNICCA.,My thoughts are bounden to no master yet;
7304,ANNICCA.,They fly from earth to heaven in a breath.
7305,ANNICCA.,Now are they all of earth.  Hast heard the tidings?

7307,ANNICCA.,
7308,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
7309,ANNICCA.,Yea--of the Prince's ball?  We go together.
7310,ANNICCA.,"Braid in thy hair our mother's pearls, and wear"

7322,ANNICCA.,Well-favored--you have seen him--exquisite
7323,ANNICCA.,"In courtly compliment, of simple manners;"
7324,ANNICCA.,You may not hear a merrier laugh than his
7325,ANNICCA.,From any boatman on the bay; well-versed
7326,ANNICCA.,In all such arts as most become his station;
7327,ANNICCA.,"Light in the dance as winged-foot Mercury,"
7328,ANNICCA.,"Eloquent on the zither, and a master"

7346,MARIA.,
7347,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
7348,ANNICCA.,The promise of his youth is to outstrip
7349,ANNICCA.,The hero of Lepanto; bright and bold
7350,ANNICCA.,"As fire, he is the very soul, the star"
7351,ANNICCA.,Of Spanish chivalry; his last achievement
7352,ANNICCA.,Seems still the flower of his accomplishments.
7353,ANNICCA.,"Musician, soldier, courtier, yea, and artist."
7354,ANNICCA.,"""He had been a painter, were he not a prince,"""
7355,ANNICCA.,"Says Messer Zurbaran.  The Calderona,"
7356,ANNICCA.,"His actress-mother, hath bequeathed to him"

7380,MARIA.,
7381,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
7382,ANNICCA.,"Nor have you in your speech; your eyes now veiled,"
7383,ANNICCA.,"Where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame,"
7384,ANNICCA.,Your blushes and your pallor have betrayed
7385,ANNICCA.,That which should lie uncounted fathom deep--
7386,ANNICCA.,The secret of a woman's foolish heart.
7387,ANNICCA.,
7388,ANNICCA.,
7389,MARIA.,MARIA.
7390,MARIA.,"And there it lies, my sibyl sister, still!"
7391,MARIA.,"Your plummet hath not reached it.  Yes, 't is love"
7392,MARIA.,"Flaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek,"
7393,MARIA.,"And quickens my lame speech--but not for him,"
7394,MARIA.,Not for the Prince--so may I vaunt his worth
7395,MARIA.,With a free soul.

7402,MARIA.,MARIA.
7403,MARIA.,"A gentleman,"
7404,MARIA.,"Favored of earth and heaven, true and loving,"
7405,MARIA.,Hath cast his heart at my imperial feet;
7406,MARIA.,"And if to-morrow find me as to-day,"
7407,MARIA.,I will e'en stoop and raise it to mine own.
7408,MARIA.,

7414,MARIA.,MARIA.
7415,MARIA.,"Not he, indeed!"
7416,MARIA.,Did not I say favored of earth and heaven?
7417,MARIA.,"That should mean other gifts than bags of gold,"
7418,MARIA.,Or a straight-featured mask.  Nor will it be
7419,MARIA.,"Any you name, though you should name him right."
7420,MARIA.,Must it not lie--how many fathom deep--

7425,ANNICCA.,"Kiss me, Maria.  You are still a child."

7427,ANNICCA.,"Your choice, I fear not, doubtless 't will prove wise,"
7428,ANNICCA.,"Despite your wild wit, for your heart is pure,"
7429,ANNICCA.,And you will pause with sure deliberate judgment
7430,ANNICCA.,Before you leave our father.
7431,ANNICCA.,
7432,ANNICCA.,
7433,MARIA.,MARIA.
7434,MARIA.,Does love steal
7435,MARIA.,So gently o'er our soul?  What if he come
7436,MARIA.,"A cloud, a fire, a whirlwind, to o'erbear"
7437,MARIA.,"The feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him,"
7438,MARIA.,And blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason?
7439,MARIA.,"Fear not, Annicca, for in no such guise"
7440,MARIA.,He visits my calm breast; but yet you speak
7441,MARIA.,Somewhat too sagely.  Did such cautious wisdom
7442,MARIA.,Guide your own fancy?
7443,MARIA.,
7444,MARIA.,
7445,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
7446,ANNICCA.,"Jest no more, Maria."
7447,ANNICCA.,"Since I became a wife, is much made clear,"
7448,ANNICCA.,Which a brief year ago was dark and vague.
7449,ANNICCA.,Tommaso loves me--we are happier
7450,ANNICCA.,"Then I had dreamed; yet matching now with then,"
7451,ANNICCA.,"I see his love is not that large, rich passion"
7452,ANNICCA.,Our father bore us.

7460,ANNICCA.,"No, no!  I have no wish and no regret."
7461,ANNICCA.,"I speak for you.  His is a sovereign soul,"
7462,ANNICCA.,And all his passions loom in huger shape
7463,ANNICCA.,Than lesser men's.  He brooks no rivalry
7464,ANNICCA.,"With his own offspring, and toward me his love"
7465,ANNICCA.,"Hath ebbed, I mark, to a more even flow,"
7466,ANNICCA.,"While deeper, stronger, sets the powerful current"
7467,ANNICCA.,"Toward you alone.  Consider this, Maria,"
7468,ANNICCA.,Nor wantonly discrown that sacred head
7469,ANNICCA.,Of your young love to wreathe some curled boy's brow.
7470,ANNICCA.,
7471,ANNICCA.,
7472,MARIA.,MARIA.
7473,MARIA.,Think you his wish were that I should not wed?

7477,ANNICCA.,"Nay, that I say not, for his pride aspires"

7482,ANNICCA.,Him will I wed

7484,ANNICCA.,As the Ribera's is illustrious--
7485,ANNICCA.,Him who no less than I will venerate
7486,ANNICCA.,"That white, divine old head.  In art his pupil,"
7487,ANNICCA.,"In love his son; tender as I to watch,"
7488,ANNICCA.,And to delay the slow extinguishing
7489,ANNICCA.,Of that great light.

7523,FIAMETTA.,"Tush, man! never name her beside my lady Maria-Rosa.  You have lost"
7524,FIAMETTA.,the richest feast in the world for hungry eyes.  Her gown of cloth
7525,FIAMETTA.,"o' silver clad her, as it were, with light; there twinkled about"
7526,FIAMETTA.,her waist a girdle stiff with stones--you would have said they
7527,FIAMETTA.,"breathed.  Mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair,"
7528,FIAMETTA.,"and pearls again were clasped around her throat.  But no, I might"
7529,FIAMETTA.,"tell thee every ornament--her jeweled fan, her comb of pearls, her"
7530,FIAMETTA.,"floating veil of gauze, and still the best of all would escape us."
7531,FIAMETTA.,
7532,FIAMETTA.,
7533,LUCA.,LUCA.
7534,LUCA.,Thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden.
7535,LUCA.,
7536,LUCA.,
7537,FIAMETTA.,FIAMETTA.
7538,FIAMETTA.,"Thou knowest not woman truly, for all thy wit.  I speak most like a"
7539,FIAMETTA.,woman when I weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel.  Heigh-ho!
7540,FIAMETTA.,"I have felt the need of this.  Thou, good Luca, who might have"
7541,FIAMETTA.,"been my father, canst understand me?  HE was poor as thou.  Why"
7542,FIAMETTA.,"shouldst thou be his lackey, his slave?  My hand were as dainty as"
7543,FIAMETTA.,"hers, if it could but be spared its daily labor."
7544,FIAMETTA.,
7545,FIAMETTA.,
7546,LUCA.,LUCA.
7547,LUCA.,"Yes, poor child, I understand thee, and yet thou art wrong.  He is"
7548,LUCA.,"more slave to pride than I am to him.  I know him well, Fiametta,"
7549,LUCA.,"after so many years of service, and to-day I pity him more than I"
7550,LUCA.,"fear him.  Why, girl, my task is sport beside his toil!  If my"
7551,LUCA.,"limbs be weary, I sleep; but I have seen him sit before his canvas"
7552,LUCA.,with straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow.  When
7553,LUCA.,"at last he gave o'er, and I have smoothed his pillow, and served"
7554,LUCA.,"and soothed him, what sleep could he snatch?  His brain is haunted"
7555,LUCA.,"with evil visions, whereof some be merely of his own imaginings,"
7556,LUCA.,"and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived, and"
7557,LUCA.,"who rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse, God only knows!  If"
7558,LUCA.,"that be genius--to be alive to pain at every pore, to be possessed"
7559,LUCA.,of a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space between
7560,LUCA.,the hours of grinding toil--I thank the saints I am a simple man!
7561,LUCA.,
7562,LUCA.,
7563,FIAMETTA.,FIAMETTA.
7564,FIAMETTA.,I grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him; he hath indeed a
7565,FIAMETTA.,"strange, sour mien.  I shudder when he turns suddenly, as his wont"
7566,FIAMETTA.,"is, and bends his evil eyes on me.  The holy father tells me such"
7567,FIAMETTA.,warnings come from God.  No matter how slight the service he asks
7568,FIAMETTA.,"of me, my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move, till I have"
7569,FIAMETTA.,whispered an Ave.  But what of Lady Maria-Rosa?  Both heaven and
7570,FIAMETTA.,"earth smile upon her.  To-night she wears a poor girl's dowry, a"
7571,FIAMETTA.,"separate fortune, on her head, her neck, her hands, yes, on her"
7572,FIAMETTA.,little jeweled feet.  One tiny shoe of hers would make me free to

7624,RIBERA.,"That was my garland, and I was her all,"
7625,RIBERA.,"Till thou, a stranger, stole her heart's allegiance,"
7626,RIBERA.,"Suborned--Forgive me, I am old, a father,"

7628,RIBERA.,"Believe me, sir.  When we Riberas give,"
7629,RIBERA.,"We give without retraction or reserve,"

7732,DON JOHN.,"Now hope, now fear"
7733,DON JOHN.,Reigned lord of my wild dreams.  One name still sang
7734,DON JOHN.,"Like the repeated strain of some caged bird,"
7735,DON JOHN.,"Its sweet, persistent music through my brain."
7736,DON JOHN.,One vanishing face upon the empty air
7737,DON JOHN.,"Shone forth and faded night and day.  And you,"
7738,DON JOHN.,"Did you not find me hasty, over-bold?"
7739,DON JOHN.,"Nay, tell me all your thought."

7742,MARIA.,MARIA.
7743,MARIA.,"You know, my lord,"

7754,MARIA.,MARIA.
7755,MARIA.,Is it not strange?
7756,MARIA.,"I knew you not, albeit I might have guessed,"
7757,MARIA.,"If only from the simple garb of black,"
7758,MARIA.,"And golden collar, 'midst the motley hues"
7759,MARIA.,"Of our gay nobles.  I know not what besides,"
7760,MARIA.,"But this first won me.  Be not angered, sir;"
7761,MARIA.,"But, as I looked, I never ranked you higher"
7762,MARIA.,Than simple gentleman.  I asked your name;
7763,MARIA.,"Then, when you Highness stooped to pick my flower,"
7764,MARIA.,"My lord, that moment was my thought a traitor,"
7765,MARIA.,For it had fain discrowned you.

7795,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
7796,RIBERA.,"This is revenge.  Is she not beautiful,"
7797,RIBERA.,Ye gods?  The beggar's child matched with a prince!
7798,RIBERA.,"Throb not so high, my heart, 'neath envious eyes"
7799,RIBERA.,Fixed on thy triumph!  Now am I well repaid
7800,RIBERA.,"For my slow, martyred years.  Was I not wrung"

7802,RIBERA.,"Though dipped in my heart's blood, might reproduce!"
7803,RIBERA.,"No twisted muscle, no contorted limb,"
7804,RIBERA.,"No agony of flesh, have I yet drawn,"
7805,RIBERA.,That owed not its suggestion to some pang
7806,RIBERA.,"Of my  pride crucified, my spirit racked,"
7807,RIBERA.,"My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate,"
7808,RIBERA.,"Engendered of oppression.  That is past,"
7809,RIBERA.,But not forgotten; though to-night I please
7810,RIBERA.,"To yield to gentler influence, to own"
7811,RIBERA.,"The strength of beauty and the power of joy,"
7812,RIBERA.,And welcome gracious phantasies that throng
7813,RIBERA.,And hover over me in airy shapes.
7814,RIBERA.,The spirits of earth and heaven contend to-night
7815,RIBERA.,For mastery within me; ne'er before
7816,RIBERA.,"Have I been more the Spagnoletto, fired"
7817,RIBERA.,"With noble wrath, with the consuming fever"
7818,RIBERA.,And fierce delight of vengeance.
7819,RIBERA.,From this point
7820,RIBERA.,I see her clearly--the auroral face
7821,RIBERA.,"A-light with smiles, the imperial head upraised;"
7822,RIBERA.,"Her languid hand sways the broad, silken fan,"
7823,RIBERA.,Whose wing-like movement stirs above her brow
7824,RIBERA.,"The fine, bright curls, as though warm airs of heaven"
7825,RIBERA.,Around her breathed.  He leads her 'midst the throng.
7826,RIBERA.,"So, they have gone; but I will follow them,"

7873,MARIA.,To urge his cause?  The same wherein I learned
7874,MARIA.,Your Highness had commanded for to-night
7875,MARIA.,Our presence.  My winged thoughts were flying back
7876,MARIA.,"To Count Lodovico's; again I saw you,"
7877,MARIA.,"My white rose at your lips, your grave eyes fixed"
7878,MARIA.,"Most frankly, yet most reverently, on mine."
7879,MARIA.,"Again my heart sank as I heard the name,"
7880,MARIA.,"The Prince of Austria; and while I mused,"
7881,MARIA.,"He spake of love.  Oh, I am much to blame!"
7882,MARIA.,"My mood was soft;--although I promised naught,"
7883,MARIA.,"I listened, yea, I listened.  Good, my lord,"
7884,MARIA.,Do you not pity him?

7886,MARIA.,
7887,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
7888,DON JOHN.,"Thanks, and thanks again,"

7890,DON JOHN.,On the unblemished mirror of my faith.
7891,DON JOHN.,"Since that dear night, I with one only thought"
7892,DON JOHN.,Have gained the sum of knowledge and opinions
7893,DON JOHN.,"Touching thine honored father, with such scraps"
7894,DON JOHN.,As the gross public voice could dole to me
7895,DON JOHN.,"Concerning thine own far-removed, white life."
7896,DON JOHN.,"Thou art, I learn, immured in close seclusion;"
7897,DON JOHN.,"Thy father, be it with all reverence said,"
7898,DON JOHN.,Hedges with jealous barriers his treasure;

7906,MARIA.,"A proud, large, tameless heart.  This is the cloister"
7907,MARIA.,Where he immures me--Naples' gayest revels;
7908,MARIA.,The only bar wherewith he hedges me
7909,MARIA.,"Is his unbounded trust, that leaves me free."

7927,RIBERA.,"In blessing on that darling, haughty head."
7928,RIBERA.,"Like the Ribera's child, she bears her honors"
7929,RIBERA.,As lightly as a flower.  Yet there glows
7930,RIBERA.,"Unwonted lustre in her starry eyes,"
7931,RIBERA.,And richer beauty blushes on her cheek.
7932,RIBERA.,Enough.  Now must I strive to fix that form
7933,RIBERA.,"That haunts my brain--the blind, old Count Camillo,"
7934,RIBERA.,The Prince's oracle. 'Midst the thick throng
7935,RIBERA.,"My fancy singled him; white beard, white hair,"

8010,MARIA.,My enchafed spirit in bounds of courtesy.
8011,MARIA.,"Nay, it was she, mine angel, whose mere aspect"

8062,AUBADE.,The blood rang beating in mine ears and roared
8063,AUBADE.,"Like rushing waters; yet, as through a dream,"

8065,AUBADE.,"Shone the clear tears.  As there's a God in heaven,"
8066,AUBADE.,She spake those words!  My lips retain the touch
8067,AUBADE.,"Of those soft, snow-cold hands, neither refused"

8250,RIBERA.,I missed you when I rose.  I sought you first

8546,RIBERA.,Sometimes I fear lest they degrade our art
8547,RIBERA.,To a nice craft for plodding artisans--
8548,RIBERA.,"Mere realism, which they mistake for truth."
8549,RIBERA.,My soul rejects such limits.  The true artist
8550,RIBERA.,Gives Nature's best effects with far less means.
8551,RIBERA.,Plain black and white suffice him to express
8552,RIBERA.,"A finer grace, a stronger energy"

8554,RIBERA.,"I argue thus and work with simple tools,"
8555,RIBERA.,"Like the Greek fathers of our art--the sculptors,"

8665,MARIA.,"My father, sir,"
8666,MARIA.,Hath surely told you our delight and marvel
8667,MARIA.,At the enchantments of your feast.  For me
8668,MARIA.,"The night was brief, rich, beautiful, and strange"
8669,MARIA.,As a bright dream.
8670,MARIA.,
8671,MARIA.,
8672,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
8673,DON JOHN.,I will gainsay you not.
8674,DON JOHN.,A beauteous soul can shed her proper glory
8675,DON JOHN.,"On mean surroundings.  I have likewise dreamed,"
8676,DON JOHN.,Nor am I yet awake.  This morn hath been
8677,DON JOHN.,"A feast for mind and eye.  Yon shepherd-prince,"
8678,DON JOHN.,"Whom angels visit in his sleep, shall crown"
8679,DON JOHN.,"Your father's brow with a still fresher laurel,"
8680,DON JOHN.,And link in equal fame the Spanish artist
8681,DON JOHN.,With the Lord's chosen prophet.
8682,DON JOHN.,
8683,DON JOHN.,
8684,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8685,RIBERA.,"That may be,"
8686,RIBERA.,For in the form of that wayfarer
8687,RIBERA.,I drew myself.  So have I slept beneath
8688,RIBERA.,"The naked heavens, pillowed by a stone,"
8689,RIBERA.,"With no more shelter than the wind-stirred branches,"
8690,RIBERA.,While the thick dews of our Valencian nights
8691,RIBERA.,"Drenched my rude weeds, and chilled through blood and bone."
8692,RIBERA.,"Yet to me also were the heavens revealed,"
8693,RIBERA.,And angels visited my dreams.
8694,RIBERA.,
8695,RIBERA.,
8696,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
8697,DON JOHN.,How strange
8698,DON JOHN.,"That you, dear masters, standing on the crown"
8699,DON JOHN.,"Of a long life's continuous ascent,"
8700,DON JOHN.,Should backward glance unto such dark beginnings.
8701,DON JOHN.,
8702,DON JOHN.,
8703,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8704,RIBERA.,Obscure are all beginnings.  Yet I muse
8705,RIBERA.,With pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle.
8706,RIBERA.,"They were to me my birthright; all the vigor,"
8707,RIBERA.,"The burning passion, the unflinching truth,"
8708,RIBERA.,"My later pencil gained, I gleaned from them."
8709,RIBERA.,"I prized them.  I reclaimed their ragged freedom,"
8710,RIBERA.,"Rather than hold my seat, a liveried slave,"
8711,RIBERA.,At the rich board of my Lord Cardinal.
8712,RIBERA.,A palace was a prison till I reared
8713,RIBERA.,Mine own.  But now my child's heart I would pierce
8714,RIBERA.,"Sooner than see it bear the least of ills,"
8715,RIBERA.,Such as I then endured.
8716,RIBERA.,
8717,RIBERA.,
8718,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
8719,DON JOHN.,Donna Maria
8720,DON JOHN.,"May smile, sir, at your threat; she is in a pleasance,"
8721,DON JOHN.,"Where no rude breezes blow, no shadow falls"
8722,DON JOHN.,Darker than that of cool and fragrant leaves.
8723,DON JOHN.,"Yea, were it otherwise--had you not reaped"
8724,DON JOHN.,"The fruit of your own works, she had not suffered."
8725,DON JOHN.,Your children are Spain's children.
8726,DON JOHN.,
8727,DON JOHN.,
8728,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8729,RIBERA.,"Sir, that word"
8730,RIBERA.,Is the most grateful you have spoken yet.
8731,RIBERA.,"Why are thou silent, daughter?"
8732,RIBERA.,
8733,RIBERA.,
8734,RIBERA.,MARIA (absently).
8735,RIBERA.,What should I say?
8736,RIBERA.,The Prince is kind.  I scarcely heard your words.
8737,RIBERA.,"I listened to your voices, and I mused."
8738,RIBERA.,
8739,RIBERA.,DON JOHN (rising).
8740,RIBERA.,I overstep your patience.
8741,RIBERA.,
8742,RIBERA.,
8743,MARIA.,MARIA.

8759,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8760,RIBERA.,"What ails you, daughter?  You forget yourself."
8761,RIBERA.,"Your tongue cleaves to your mouth.  You sit and muse,"
8762,RIBERA.,A statue of white silence.  Twice to-day
8763,RIBERA.,You have deeply vexed me.  Go not thus again
8764,RIBERA.,"Across the street with that light child, Fiametta."
8765,RIBERA.,"Faith, you were closely muffled.  What was this--"
8766,RIBERA.,This tell-tale auburn curl that rippled down
8767,RIBERA.,"Over the black mantilla?  Were I harsh,"
8768,RIBERA.,"Suspicious, jealous, fearful, prone to wrath,"
8769,RIBERA.,"Or anything of all that I am not,"
8770,RIBERA.,"I should have deemed it no mere negligence,"
8771,RIBERA.,But a bold token.
8772,RIBERA.,
8773,RIBERA.,
8774,MARIA.,MARIA.
8775,MARIA.,Father you make me quail.
8776,MARIA.,Why do you threat me with such evil eyes?
8777,MARIA.,Would they could read my heart!
8778,MARIA.,
8779,MARIA.,
8780,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8781,RIBERA.,Elude me not.
8782,RIBERA.,Whom have you met beside the Prince this morn?
8783,RIBERA.,Who saw you pass?  Whom have you spoken with?
8784,RIBERA.,
8785,RIBERA.,
8786,MARIA.,MARIA.
8787,MARIA.,"For God's sake, father, what strange thoughts are these?"
8788,MARIA.,"With none, with none!  Beside the Prince, you say?"
8789,MARIA.,"Why even him I saw not, as you know."
8790,MARIA.,"I hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground,"
8791,MARIA.,"Swathed in my mantle still, I told my beads,"
8792,MARIA.,And in like manner hasted home to you.
8793,MARIA.,
8794,MARIA.,
8795,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
8796,RIBERA.,"Well, it may pass; but henceforth say thy matins"
8797,RIBERA.,In thine own room.  I know what vague cloud
8798,RIBERA.,Obscures my sight and weighs upon my brain.
8799,RIBERA.,"I am very weary. Luca, follow me."

8802,RIBERA.,
8803,MARIA.,MARIA.
8804,MARIA.,Poor father!  Dimly he perceives some trouble
8805,MARIA.,"Within the threatening air.  Thank heaven, I calmed him,"
8806,MARIA.,Yet I spake truth.  What could have roused so soon
8807,MARIA.,His quick suspicion?  Did Fiametta see
8808,MARIA.,"The wary page slip in my hand the missive,"
8809,MARIA.,"As we came forth again?  Nay, even so,"
8810,MARIA.,My father hath not spoken with her since.
8811,MARIA.,Sure he knows naught; 't is but my foolish fear
8812,MARIA.,Makes monsters out of shadows.  I may read
8813,MARIA.,The priceless lines and grave them on my heart.
8814,MARIA.,"[She draws from her bosom a letter, reads it, and presses it to"
8815,MARIA.,her lips.]
8816,MARIA.,"He loves me, yes, he loves me!  Oh, my God,"
8817,MARIA.,This awful joy in mine own breast is love!
8818,MARIA.,To-night he will await me in our garden.
8819,MARIA.,"Oh, for a word, a pressure of the hand!"
8820,MARIA.,"I fly, my prince, at thy most dear behest!"

8830,DON TOMMASO.,DON TOMMASO.
8831,DON TOMMASO.,"Truly, you wrong your sister; she is young,"
8832,DON TOMMASO.,"Heedless, and wilful, that is all; a touch"
8833,DON TOMMASO.,Of the Ribera's spirit fired the lass.
8834,DON TOMMASO.,Don John was but her weapon of revenge
8835,DON TOMMASO.,"Against the malice of our haughty matrons,"
8836,DON TOMMASO.,Who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heights
8837,DON TOMMASO.,Of dignity upon the artist's daughter.
8838,DON TOMMASO.,
8839,DON TOMMASO.,
8840,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
8841,ANNICCA.,"I cannot think with you.  In her demeanor,"
8842,ANNICCA.,"Her kindled cheek, her melting eye, was more"
8843,ANNICCA.,Than sly revenge or cautious policy.
8844,ANNICCA.,"If that was art, it overreached itself."
8845,ANNICCA.,"Ere the night ended, I had blushed to see"
8846,ANNICCA.,"Slighting regards cast on my father's child,"
8847,ANNICCA.,And hear her name and his tossed lightly round.
8848,ANNICCA.,
8849,ANNICCA.,
8850,DON TOMMASO.,DON TOMMASO.
8851,DON TOMMASO.,Could you not read in such disparagement
8852,DON TOMMASO.,The envy of small natures?
8853,DON TOMMASO.,
8854,DON TOMMASO.,
8855,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
8856,ANNICCA.,I had as lief
8857,ANNICCA.,Maria were to dance the tarantella
8858,ANNICCA.,"Upon the quay at noonday, as to see her"
8859,ANNICCA.,Gazed at again with such insulting homage.
8860,ANNICCA.,
8861,ANNICCA.,
8862,DON TOMMASO.,DON TOMMASO.
8863,DON TOMMASO.,You are too strict; your baseless apprehensions
8864,DON TOMMASO.,Wrong her far more than strangers' jests.
8865,DON TOMMASO.,
8866,DON TOMMASO.,
8867,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
8868,ANNICCA.,Not so;
8869,ANNICCA.,My timely fears prevent a greater ill
8870,ANNICCA.,"And work no harm, since they shall be imparted"
8871,ANNICCA.,"Only to him who hath the power to quell them,"
8872,ANNICCA.,Dissolving them to air--my father.

8874,ANNICCA.,
8875,DON TOMMASO.,DON TOMMASO.
8876,DON TOMMASO.,How!
8877,DON TOMMASO.,You surely will not rouse his fatal wrath?
8878,DON TOMMASO.,"Annicca, listen: if your doubts were true,"
8879,DON TOMMASO.,"He whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes,"
8880,DON TOMMASO.,"More like the passion of some wild, dumb creature,"
8881,DON TOMMASO.,"With prowling jealousy and deadly spring,"
8882,DON TOMMASO.,"Forth leaping at the first approach of ill,"
8883,DON TOMMASO.,Than the calm tenderness of human fathers;
8884,DON TOMMASO.,He surely had been keen to scent the danger.
8885,DON TOMMASO.,"I saw him at the ball--as is his wont,"
8886,DON TOMMASO.,"He mingled not among the revellers,"
8887,DON TOMMASO.,But like her shadow played the spy on her.

8894,DON TOMMASO.,DON TOMMASO.
8895,DON TOMMASO.,"Ah, there you err; he knows no middle term."
8896,DON TOMMASO.,At once he would accept as fact the worst
8897,DON TOMMASO.,Of your imaginings; his rage would smite
8898,DON TOMMASO.,"All near him, and rebound upon himself;"
8899,DON TOMMASO.,"For, as I learn, Don John brings royal orders"
8900,DON TOMMASO.,For the Queen's gallery; he would dismiss
8901,DON TOMMASO.,The Prince as roughly as a begging artist.
8902,DON TOMMASO.,Make no such breach just now betwixt the court

8928,DON JOHN.,"In any less than she, so swift a passion,"
8929,DON JOHN.,"So unreserved, so reckless, had repelled."
8930,DON JOHN.,In her 't is godlike.  Our mutual love
8931,DON JOHN.,"Was born full-grown, as we gazed each on each."
8932,DON JOHN.,"Nay, 't was not born, but like a thing eternal,"
8933,DON JOHN.,It WAS ere we had consciousness thereof;
8934,DON JOHN.,"No growth of slow development, but perfect"
8935,DON JOHN.,"From the beginning, neither doomed to end."
8936,DON JOHN.,"Her garden breathes her own warm, southern beauty,"
8937,DON JOHN.,Glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom.
8938,DON JOHN.,Here I am happy--happy to dream and wait
8939,DON JOHN.,In rich security of bliss.  I know
8940,DON JOHN.,How brief an interval divides us now.
8941,DON JOHN.,She hastes to meet me with no less impatience
8942,DON JOHN.,"Than mine to clasp her in my arms, to press"
8943,DON JOHN.,"Heart unto heart, and see the love within"
8944,DON JOHN.,The unfathomable depths of her great eyes.
8945,DON JOHN.,She comes.  Maria!
8946,DON JOHN.,
8947,DON JOHN.,"Enter MARIA, half timid, half joyous."

8955,DON JOHN.,"Darling, not long; 't was but my restless love"

8957,DON JOHN.,So were I well content to wait through ages
8958,DON JOHN.,"Upon the threshold of a joy like this,"

8961,DON JOHN.,
8962,DON JOHN.,
8963,MARIA.,MARIA.
8964,MARIA.,"Your love is less than mine,"

8967,MARIA.,
8968,MARIA.,
8969,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
8970,DON JOHN.,I had rather speak
8971,DON JOHN.,Less than the truth to have you chide me thus;
8972,DON JOHN.,"Yet if you enter in the lists with me,"
8973,DON JOHN.,"Faith match with faith, and loyal heart with heart,"
8974,DON JOHN.,"I warrant you, the jealous god of love,"
8975,DON JOHN.,"Who spies us from yon pomegranate bush,"
8976,DON JOHN.,Would crown me victor.

8979,MARIA.,MARIA.
8980,MARIA.,Why should we compete?

8984,MARIA.,
8985,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
8986,DON JOHN.,The worship of my life
8987,DON JOHN.,Will be slight payment for your boundless trust.
8988,DON JOHN.,"Look we nor forth nor back, are we not happy?"
8989,DON JOHN.,Heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars.
8990,DON JOHN.,"The envious day forced us apart, the wing"
8991,DON JOHN.,Of obscure night protects and shelters us.
8992,DON JOHN.,"Now like a pure, night-blooming flower, puts forth"
8993,DON JOHN.,"The perfect blossom of our love.  Oh, lean"
8994,DON JOHN.,Thy royal head upon my breast; assure me
8995,DON JOHN.,That this unheard-of bliss is no fond dream.
8996,DON JOHN.,"Cling to me, darling, till thy love's dear burden"

9004,DON JOHN.,
9005,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
9006,DON JOHN.,Naught save the beating of our hearts I heard.
9007,DON JOHN.,"Be calm, my love; the very air is hushed."
9008,DON JOHN.,"Listen, the tinkle of the fountain yonder,"
9009,DON JOHN.,
9010,DON JOHN.,"The sleepy stir of leaves, the querulous pipe"
9011,DON JOHN.,Of some far bird--no more.
9012,DON JOHN.,
9013,DON JOHN.,
9014,MARIA.,MARIA.
9015,MARIA.,"I heard, I heard!"
9016,MARIA.,A rude voice called me.  Wherefore did it come
9017,MARIA.,To snatch me from that dream of restful love?
9018,MARIA.,"Oh, Juan, you will save me, you will help,--"
9019,MARIA.,Tell me you will--I have lost all for you!
9020,MARIA.,
9021,MARIA.,
9022,DON JOHN.,DON JOHN.
9023,DON JOHN.,To-morrow you will laugh at fears like these.
9024,DON JOHN.,You have lost naught--you have but won my love.

9028,MARIA.,MARIA.
9029,MARIA.,"I tremble still in every limb.  Good-night,"
9030,MARIA.,"I must be gone.  To-morrow when you come,"
9031,MARIA.,Be wary with my father; he is fierce
9032,MARIA.,"In love and hatred.  Listen and look, my lord."
9033,MARIA.,If one dared say to me but yester-morn
9034,MARIA.,That I would meet at night a stranger youth
9035,MARIA.,"In mine own garden, talk with him of love,"
9036,MARIA.,"And hint a thought against the Spagnoletto,"
9037,MARIA.,I had smitten with this bauble such a one.

9056,RIBERA.,His is a bold and shapely head--it pleased me.

9083,RIBERA.,"What hast thou heard?  By heaven, if one foul word"

9100,RIBERA.,"From the great Angelo's divinity,"
9101,RIBERA.,Down to the pest of flies that fret us here
9102,RIBERA.,At the day's hottest.  Sometimes he will pace
9103,RIBERA.,The studio--such young blood is seldom still.
9104,RIBERA.,"He brought me once his mandoline, and drew"
9105,RIBERA.,Eloquent music thence.  I study thus
9106,RIBERA.,The changeful play of soul.  I catch the spirit

9108,RIBERA.,Maria comes and goes--will sit awhile
9109,RIBERA.,"Over her broidery, then will haste away"
9110,RIBERA.,And serve us with a dish of golden fruit.
9111,RIBERA.,"That is for me; she knows the sweet, cool juice,"
9112,RIBERA.,"After long hours of work, refreshes me"
9113,RIBERA.,More than strong wine.  She meets his Royal Highness
9114,RIBERA.,As the Ribera's child should meet a Prince--
9115,RIBERA.,"Nor over bold, nor timid; one would think"

9124,ANNICCA.,
9125,ANNICCA.,
9126,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9127,RIBERA.,"So nigh, that were Don John to leave to-morrow,"
9128,RIBERA.,It might go with him.
9129,RIBERA.,
9130,RIBERA.,
9131,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
9132,ANNICCA.,What! he leaves Naples?
9133,ANNICCA.,
9134,ANNICCA.,
9135,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9136,RIBERA.,"Yea, but I know not when; he seems to wait"
9137,RIBERA.,"Momently, orders from his Majesty"
9138,RIBERA.,To travel onward.
9139,RIBERA.,
9140,RIBERA.,
9141,RIBERA.,ANNICCA (aside).
9142,RIBERA.,Would he were well away!

9146,RIBERA.,What do you mutter?  I grow deaf this side.
9147,RIBERA.,
9148,RIBERA.,
9149,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
9150,ANNICCA.,"I spake not, father.  I regret with you"
9151,ANNICCA.,The Prince should leave us; you have more enjoyed
9152,ANNICCA.,His young companionship than any strangers
9153,ANNICCA.,These many years.
9154,ANNICCA.,
9155,ANNICCA.,
9156,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9157,RIBERA.,"Well, well, enough of him."
9158,RIBERA.,"He hath a winning air--so far, so good."
9159,RIBERA.,I know not that I place more trust in him
9160,RIBERA.,Than in another.  'T is a lying world;
9161,RIBERA.,I am too old now to be duped or dazzled
9162,RIBERA.,By fair externals.
9163,RIBERA.,
9164,RIBERA.,"Enter MARIA, carrying a kirtle full of flowers."
9165,RIBERA.,
9166,RIBERA.,
9167,MARIA.,MARIA.
9168,MARIA.,"Father, see! my roses"
9169,MARIA.,Have blossomed over night; I bring you some
9170,MARIA.,"To prank your study.  Sister, Don Tommaso"
9171,MARIA.,Seeks you below.
9172,MARIA.,
9173,MARIA.,
9174,MARIA.,ANNICCA (rising).
9175,MARIA.,"I will go to meet him.  Father,"
9176,MARIA.,Until to-morrow.

9178,MARIA.,displays her flowers.]
9179,MARIA.,
9180,MARIA.,
9181,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9182,RIBERA.,"Truly, a gorgeous show!"
9183,RIBERA.,"Pink, yellow, crimson, white--which is the fairest?"
9184,RIBERA.,Those with the deepest blush should best become you--
9185,RIBERA.,"Nay, they accord not with your hair's red gold;"
9186,RIBERA.,"The white ones suit you best--pale, innocent,"
9187,RIBERA.,So flowers too can lie!  Is not that strange?
9188,RIBERA.,[MARIA looks at him in mingled wonder and affright.  He roughly
9189,RIBERA.,"brushes aside all the flowers upon the floors, than picks one up"
9190,RIBERA.,and carefully plucks it to pieces.]
9191,RIBERA.,"I think not highly of your flowers, girl;"
9192,RIBERA.,I have plucked this leaf; it has no heart.
9193,RIBERA.,See there!
9194,RIBERA.,[He laughs contemptuously.]
9195,RIBERA.,
9196,RIBERA.,
9197,MARIA.,MARIA.
9198,MARIA.,What have I done?  Alas! what mean you?

9203,RIBERA.,"Nay, but found it."

9205,RIBERA.,"""Don John is comely,"" and ""Don John is kind;"""
9206,RIBERA.,"""A wonderful musician is Don John,"""
9207,RIBERA.,"""A princely artist""--and then, meek of mien,"
9208,RIBERA.,"You enter in his presence, modest, simple."
9209,RIBERA.,And who beneath that kitten grace had spied
9210,RIBERA.,"The claws of mischief?  Who!  Why, all the world,"
9211,RIBERA.,"Save the fond, wrinkled, hoary fool, thy father."
9212,RIBERA.,"Out, girl, for shame!  He will be here anon;"
9213,RIBERA.,Hence to your room--he shall not find you here.
9214,RIBERA.,"Thank God, thank God! no evil hath been wrought"
9215,RIBERA.,That may not be repaired.  I have sat by
9216,RIBERA.,At all your meetings.  You shall have no more;
9217,RIBERA.,"Myself will look to that.  Away, away!"
9218,RIBERA.,[Exit Maria.]
9219,RIBERA.,
9220,RIBERA.,
9221,RIBERA.,RIBERA (looks after her).
9222,RIBERA.,"As one who has received a deadly hurt,"
9223,RIBERA.,She walks.  What if my doubts be false?  The terror
9224,RIBERA.,"Of an unlooked-for blow, a treacherous thrust"
9225,RIBERA.,When least expected--that is all she showed.
9226,RIBERA.,"On a false charge, myself had acted thus."
9227,RIBERA.,She had been moved far otherwise if guilty;
9228,RIBERA.,"She had wept, protested, begged--she had not left"
9229,RIBERA.,With such a proud and speechless show of grief.
9230,RIBERA.,"I was too harsh, too quick on slight suspicion."
9231,RIBERA.,"What did Annicca say?  Why, she said naught."
9232,RIBERA.,"'T was her grave air, her sudden reticence,"
9233,RIBERA.,Her ill-assumed indifference.  They play on me;
9234,RIBERA.,"They know me not.  They dread my violent passions,"
9235,RIBERA.,Not guessing what a firm and constant bridle
9236,RIBERA.,"I hold them with.  On just cause to be angered,"
9237,RIBERA.,Is merely human.  Yet they sound my temper;
9238,RIBERA.,"They try to lead me like some half-tamed beast,"
9239,RIBERA.,"That must be coaxed.  Well, I may laugh thereat."
9240,RIBERA.,But I am not myself to-day; strange pains
9241,RIBERA.,Shoot through my head and limbs and vex my spirit.
9242,RIBERA.,"Oh, I have wronged my child!  Return, Maria!"

9251,SCENE I.,
9252,SCENE I.,"Night. RIBERA'S bedroom.  RIBERA discovered in his dressing-gown,"
9253,SCENE I.,"seated reading beside a table, with a light upon it. Enter from"
9254,SCENE I.,"an open door at the back of the stage, MARIA. She stands"
9255,SCENE I.,"irresolute for a moment on the threshold behind her father,"
9256,SCENE I.,"watching him, passes her hand rapidly over her brow and eyes,"
9257,SCENE I.,and then knocks.

9260,MARIA.,MARIA.
9261,MARIA.,"May I come in, dear father?"

9273,RIBERA.,"Poor child, thou must be weary.  Thou art pale"

9275,RIBERA.,
9276,RIBERA.,
9277,RIBERA.,MARIA (with a forced laugh).
9278,RIBERA.,I had forgotten it.
9279,RIBERA.,"Nay, I am well again."
9280,RIBERA.,
9281,RIBERA.,
9282,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9283,RIBERA.,"But I forget it not,"
9284,RIBERA.,"Neither forgive myself.  Well, it is past,"
9285,RIBERA.,Enough!  When the Prince left I sent for thee;
9286,RIBERA.,Thou wast still sleeping?
9287,RIBERA.,
9288,RIBERA.,
9289,RIBERA.,MARIA (with confusion).
9290,RIBERA.,"Yes, I was outworn."
9291,RIBERA.,What didst thou wish of me?
9292,RIBERA.,
9293,RIBERA.,
9294,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9295,RIBERA.,Merely to tell thee
9296,RIBERA.,Don John leaves Naples.  He expressed regret
9297,RIBERA.,Most courteously that thou wast suffering.
9298,RIBERA.,He had fain ordered us his parting thanks
9299,RIBERA.,For our kind welcome--so he deigned to say.
9300,RIBERA.,To-morrow he may steal a moment's grace
9301,RIBERA.,"To see us both once more; but this is doubtful,"
9302,RIBERA.,So he entrusted his farewells to me.

9306,MARIA.,May peace go with him.

9310,RIBERA.,We are alone--
9311,RIBERA.,"Are we not, darling?  Thanks for the calm content"
9312,RIBERA.,"Wherewith thou biddest him farewell, to nestle"
9313,RIBERA.,"Once more in mine embrace.  Not long, I feel,"
9314,RIBERA.,May these old horny eyes be blest with sight
9315,RIBERA.,"Of thy full-flowering grace, these wrinkled lips"
9316,RIBERA.,Be pressed against thy brow.  I am no more
9317,RIBERA.,What I have been; at times both hand and brain
9318,RIBERA.,Refuse their task.  Myself will follow soon--
9319,RIBERA.,The better part of me already dead.
9320,RIBERA.,"So the worm claims us by slow torture, child."
9321,RIBERA.,"Thou'lt bear with me, if as to-day I wrong"

9329,MARIA.,
9330,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9331,RIBERA.,"Mine angel-child, weep not"
9332,RIBERA.,So bitterly.  I thought not thus to move thee.
9333,RIBERA.,Still thou art overwrought.  I would have asked
9334,RIBERA.,"At last a promise of thee.  I am selfish,"
9335,RIBERA.,"But I would sleep less startingly o'nights,"
9336,RIBERA.,"And bear a calmer soul by day, were I secure"
9337,RIBERA.,That thou wilt bide with me until the end.
9338,RIBERA.,[A pause.]
9339,RIBERA.,To-night I will not press thee.  Thou art weary;
9340,RIBERA.,Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet;
9341,RIBERA.,But from thy deep emotion I can see
9342,RIBERA.,'T will cost thee less than I have feared.  To-morrow
9343,RIBERA.,We will talk of this again.

9355,MARIA.,MARIA.
9356,MARIA.,"Father,"
9357,MARIA.,I cannot leave thee!  Every word of thine
9358,MARIA.,"Gnaws like a burning coal my sore, soft heart."
9359,MARIA.,"What! thou shalt suffer, and thine own Maria"
9360,MARIA.,"Will leave thee daughterless, uncomforted?"
9361,MARIA.,"What! thou shalt weep, and other eyes than mine"

9365,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9366,RIBERA.,"There, there, poor child!  Look up, cling not so wildly"
9367,RIBERA.,"About my neck.  Thou art too finely touched,"
9368,RIBERA.,If thus the faint foreshadow of a grief
9369,RIBERA.,Can overcome thee.  Listen?  What was that?
9370,RIBERA.,
9371,RIBERA.,
9372,RIBERA.,"MARIA (starts up, shudders violently, and, all at once, masters"
9373,RIBERA.,her emotion).

9376,RIBERA.,
9377,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9378,RIBERA.,"Yes, a sound"

9381,RIBERA.,
9382,RIBERA.,
9383,MARIA.,MARIA.
9384,MARIA.,"Dear father,"
9385,MARIA.,Surely 't was naught.  Your ears deceive you.
9386,MARIA.,"The wind is rising, and you heard the leaves"
9387,MARIA.,Rustling together.
9388,MARIA.,
9389,MARIA.,
9390,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9391,RIBERA.,"Nay, I will look forth."

9396,RIBERA.,RIBERA (calling).
9397,RIBERA.,"Hist, answer!  Who goes there? (a pause.)  No sound.  Thou'rt right,"
9398,RIBERA.,Maria; I see naught; our garden lies
9399,RIBERA.,"Vacant and still, save for the swaying branches"
9400,RIBERA.,"Of bush and tree.  'T is a wild, threatening night."
9401,RIBERA.,"A sultry breeze is blowing, and the sky"
9402,RIBERA.,Hangs black above Vesuvius.  Yonder cloud
9403,RIBERA.,"Hath lightnings in it.  Ah, a blinding bolt"
9404,RIBERA.,Dims the volcano's pillared fire.  Enough.
9405,RIBERA.,[He closes the casement and returns to MARIA.]
9406,RIBERA.,"Hark, how the thunder rolls!  My child, you tremble"

9417,RIBERA.,"Thou, who art safely housed,"
9418,RIBERA.,"Why shouldst thou dread it?  Try to sleep, my darling;"
9419,RIBERA.,Forget the terror of the tempest; morn

9434,RIBERA.,"Even as thou standest now, vested in white,"
9435,RIBERA.,"With glowing eyes and pale, unsmiling face,"
9436,RIBERA.,I see her as she stood the day her heart

9639,RIBERA.,How laughingly the clear sun shines to-day
9640,RIBERA.,"On storm-drenched green, and cool, far-glittering seas!"
9641,RIBERA.,"When she comes in to greet me, she will blush"
9642,RIBERA.,For last night's terrors.  How she crouched and shuddered
9643,RIBERA.,At the mere thought of the wild war without!
9644,RIBERA.,"Poor, clinging women's souls, what need is theirs"
9645,RIBERA.,Of our protecting love!  Yet even on me
9646,RIBERA.,The shadow of the storm-cloud seemed to breed.
9647,RIBERA.,Through my vexed sleep I heard the thunder roll;
9648,RIBERA.,"My dreams were ugly--Well, all that is past;"
9649,RIBERA.,To-day my spirit is renewed.  'T is long
9650,RIBERA.,Since I have felt so fresh.
9651,RIBERA.,[He seats himself before his easel and takes up his brush and
9652,RIBERA.,"palette, but holds them idly in his hand.]"
9653,RIBERA.,"Strange, she still sleeps!"
9654,RIBERA.,The hour is past when she is wont to come
9655,RIBERA.,To bless me with the kiss of virgin love.
9656,RIBERA.,Mayhap 't was fever in her eyes last night
9657,RIBERA.,"Gave them so wild a glance, so bright a lustre."
9658,RIBERA.,God! if she should be ill!

9670,RIBERA.,Go ask Fiametta if the mistress sleeps--
9671,RIBERA.,If she be ailing--why she has not come

9674,RIBERA.,
9675,RIBERA.,
9676,RIBERA.,RIBERA (begins pacing the stage).
9677,RIBERA.,What fond fears are these
9678,RIBERA.,Mastering my spirit?  Since her mother died
9679,RIBERA.,I tremble at the name of pain or ill.
9680,RIBERA.,"How can my rude love tend, my hard hand soothe,"
9681,RIBERA.,The dear child's fragile--
9682,RIBERA.,[A confused cry without.]
9683,RIBERA.,What is that?  My God!
9684,RIBERA.,How hast thou stricken me!

9718,LUCA.,"Quiet, Fiametta.  When the master finds"
9719,LUCA.,"The empty, untouched bed, the silent room,"

9722,LUCA.,Reenter RIBERA calling.
9723,LUCA.,
9724,LUCA.,
9725,LUCA.,"Maria! Daughter! Where have they taken thee,"
9726,LUCA.,"My only one, my darling?  Oh, the brigands!"
9727,LUCA.,"Naples shall bleed for this.  What do ye here,"
9728,LUCA.,"Slaves, fools, who stare upon me?  Know ye not"
9729,LUCA.,I have been robbed?  Hence!  Ransack every house
9730,LUCA.,From cave to roof in Naples.  Search all streets.
9731,LUCA.,Arrest whomso ye meet.  Let no sail stir
9732,LUCA.,From out the harbor.  Ring the alarum!  Quick!
9733,LUCA.,This is a general woe.
9734,LUCA.,[Exeunt LUCA and FIAMETTA.]
9735,LUCA.,The Duke's my friend;
9736,LUCA.,"He'll further me.  The Prince--oh, hideous fear!--"
9737,LUCA.,"No, no, I will not dream it.  Mine enemies"
9738,LUCA.,Have done this thing; the avengers of that beggar--
9739,LUCA.,Domenichino--they have struck home at last.
9740,LUCA.,"How was it that I heard no sound, no cry,"
9741,LUCA.,Throughout the night?  The heavens themselves conspired
9742,LUCA.,Against me--the hoarse thunder drowned her shrieks!
9743,LUCA.,"Oh, agony!"
9744,LUCA.,[He buries his face in his hands.  Enter ANNICCA; she throws
9745,LUCA.,herself speechless and weeping upon his neck.]
9746,LUCA.,"Thou knowest it, Annicca!"
9747,LUCA.,The thief has entered in the night--she's gone.
9748,LUCA.,I stand and weep; I stir not hand or foot.
9749,LUCA.,Is not the household roused?  Do they not seek her?
9750,LUCA.,"I am helpless, weak; an old man overnight."
9751,LUCA.,The brigands' work was easy.  I heard naught.
9752,LUCA.,"But surely, surely, had they murdered her,"
9753,LUCA.,I had heard that--that would have wakened me
9754,LUCA.,From out my grave.

9765,ANNICCA.,
9766,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
9767,ANNICCA.,Alas! they have not found her;
9768,ANNICCA.,But that were easy.  Nerve thyself--remember
9769,ANNICCA.,Thou art the Spagnoletto still.  Last night

9774,RIBERA.,Ah!

9788,RIBERA.,"[She kneels before her father, chafing and kissing his hands. Exit"
9789,RIBERA.,"LUCA, who returns immediately with a silver flagon of water. ANNICCA"
9790,RIBERA.,seizes it and raises it to RIVERA'S lips.  He takes it from her hand
9791,RIBERA.,and drinks.]

9793,RIBERA.,
9794,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
9795,RIBERA.,How your hand trembles!
9796,RIBERA.,"See, mine is firm.  You had spilt it o'er my beard"
9797,RIBERA.,Had I not saved it.  Thanks.  I am strong again.
9798,RIBERA.,I am very old for such a steady grasp.
9799,RIBERA.,"Why, girl, most men as hoary as thy father"
9800,RIBERA.,Are long since palsied.  But my firm touch comes
9801,RIBERA.,"From handling of the brush.  I am a painter,"
9802,RIBERA.,The Spagnoletto--
9803,RIBERA.,"[As he speaks his name he suddenly throws off his apathy, rises"
9804,RIBERA.,"to his full height, and casts the flagon to the ground.]"
9805,RIBERA.,"Ah, the Spagnoletto,"
9806,RIBERA.,"Disgraced, abandoned!  My exalted name"
9807,RIBERA.,The laughing-stock of churls; my hearthstone stamped
9808,RIBERA.,"With everlasting shame; my pride, my fame,"
9809,RIBERA.,"Mine honor--where are they?  With yon spilt water,"
9810,RIBERA.,"Fouled in the dust, sucked by the thirsty air."
9811,RIBERA.,"Now, by Christ's blood, my vengeance shall be huge"
9812,RIBERA.,As mine affront.  I will demand full justice
9813,RIBERA.,From Philip.  We will treat as King with King.
9814,RIBERA.,"HE shall be stripped of rank and name and wealth,"
9815,RIBERA.,"Degraded, lopped from off the fellowship"
9816,RIBERA.,"Of Christians like a rotten limb, proclaimed"
9817,RIBERA.,"The bastard that he is.  She shall go with him,"
9818,RIBERA.,"Linked in a common infamy, haled round,"
9819,RIBERA.,"A female Judas, who betrayed her father,"
9820,RIBERA.,"Her God, her conscience, with a kiss.  Her shadow"
9821,RIBERA.,"Shall be my curse.  Cursed be her sleep by night,"
9822,RIBERA.,Accursed her light by day--her meat and drink!
9823,RIBERA.,Accursed the fruit of her own womb--the grave
9824,RIBERA.,"Where she will lie!  Cursed--Oh, my child, my child!"
9825,RIBERA.,[He throws himself on the floor and buries his head among the
9826,RIBERA.,cushions of the couch. DON TOMMASO advances and lays his hand

9836,DON TOMMASO.,"Honored!  Yes, honored with a rifled home,"
9837,DON TOMMASO.,"A desecrated heart, a strumpet child."
9838,DON TOMMASO.,"For honors such as these, I have not stinted"
9839,DON TOMMASO.,"Sweat, blood, or spirit through long years of toil."
9840,DON TOMMASO.,I have passed through peril scathless; I was spared
9841,DON TOMMASO.,When Naples was plague-stricken; I have 'scaped
9842,DON TOMMASO.,Mine enemies' stiletto--fire and flood;
9843,DON TOMMASO.,"I have survived my love, my youth, my self,"
9844,DON TOMMASO.,"My thrice-blest Leonora, whom I pitied,"
9845,DON TOMMASO.,"Fool that I was! in her void, silent tomb."

9858,RIBERA.,"Oh, I am shamed!  Cover my head, Annicca;"
9859,RIBERA.,"Darken mine eyes, and veil my face.  Oh, God,"
9860,RIBERA.,"Would that I were a nameless, obscure man,"
9861,RIBERA.,"So could I bury with me my disgrace,"
9862,RIBERA.,"That now must be immortal.  Where thou standest,"
9863,RIBERA.,"Annicca, there she stood last night.  She kissed me;"
9864,RIBERA.,"Round mine old neck she wreathed her soft, young arms."
9865,RIBERA.,My wrinkled cheeks were wet with her warm tears.
9866,RIBERA.,"She shuddered, and I thought it was the thunder"

10037,RIBERA.,"Well, I will go with thee.  But, hark thee, lad;"
10038,RIBERA.,A word first in thine ear.  'T is a grim secret;
10039,RIBERA.,"Whisper it not in Naples; I but tell thee,"
10040,RIBERA.,Lest thou should fancy I had lost my wits.
10041,RIBERA.,My daughter hath deserted me--hath fled
10042,RIBERA.,"From Naples with a bastard.  Thou hast seen her,"
10043,RIBERA.,Maria-Rosa--thou must remember her;
10044,RIBERA.,"She, whom I painted as Madonna once."
10045,RIBERA.,She had fair hair and Spanish eyes.  When was it?
10046,RIBERA.,I came forth thinking I might meet with her
10047,RIBERA.,And find all this a dream--a foolish thought!
10048,RIBERA.,I am very weary.  (Yawning.)  I have walked and walked
10049,RIBERA.,"For hours.  How far, sir, stand we from the Strada"
10050,RIBERA.,"Nardo?  I live there, nigh Saint Francis' church."
10051,RIBERA.,
10052,LORENZO.,LORENZO.
10053,LORENZO.,"Why, 't is hard by; a stone's throw from this square."

10066,ANNICCA.,ANNICCA.
10067,ANNICCA.,His heavy sleep still lasts.  Despite the words
10068,ANNICCA.,"Of the physician, I can cast not off"
10069,ANNICCA.,"That ghastly fear.  Albeit he owned no drugs,"
10070,ANNICCA.,"This deathlike slumber, this deep breathing slow,"
10071,ANNICCA.,His livid pallor makes me dread each moment
10072,ANNICCA.,"His weary pulse will cease.  This is the end,"
10073,ANNICCA.,And from the first I knew it.  The worst evil
10074,ANNICCA.,My warning tongue had wrought were joy to this.
10075,ANNICCA.,No heavier curse could I invoke on her
10076,ANNICCA.,"Than that she see him in her dreams, her thoughts,"
10077,ANNICCA.,As he is now.  I could no longer bear it;
10078,ANNICCA.,I have fled hither from his couch to breathe--
10079,ANNICCA.,To quicken my spent courage for the end.
10080,ANNICCA.,I cannot pray--my heart is full of curses.
10081,ANNICCA.,He sleeps; he rests.  What better could I wish
10082,ANNICCA.,"For his rent heart, his stunned, unbalanced brain,"
10083,ANNICCA.,Than sleep to be eternally prolonged?

10106,FIAMETTA.,"'T was I who led her to the hut.  I will confess,"
10107,FIAMETTA.,"If any sin there be, to Father Clement,"
10108,FIAMETTA.,And buy indulgence with her golden chain.

10139,RIBERA.,"Child, I was not weary."
10140,RIBERA.,There was some cloud pressed here (pointing to his forehead) but
10141,RIBERA.,"that is past,"
10142,RIBERA.,I have no pain nor any sense of ill.
10143,RIBERA.,"Now, while my brain is clear, I have a word"
10144,RIBERA.,"To speak.  I think not I have been to thee,"
10145,RIBERA.,"Nor to that other one, an unkind father."
10146,RIBERA.,"I do not now remember any act,"
10147,RIBERA.,"Or any word of mine, could cause thee grief."
10148,RIBERA.,But I am old--perchance my memory

10152,RIBERA.,ANNICCA (weeping).
10153,RIBERA.,"Oh, father, father, why will you torture me?"

10156,RIBERA.,
10157,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
10158,RIBERA.,"Why, so I thought."
10159,RIBERA.,Since it appears the guerdon of such goodness
10160,RIBERA.,"Is treachery, abandonment, disgrace,"
10161,RIBERA.,I here renounce my fatherhood.  No child
10162,RIBERA.,Will I acknowledge mine.  Thou art a wife;
10163,RIBERA.,Thy duty is thy husband's.  When Antonio
10164,RIBERA.,"Returns from Seville, tell him that his father"
10165,RIBERA.,Is long since dead.  Henceforward I will own
10166,RIBERA.,"No kin, no home, no tie.  I will away,"
10167,RIBERA.,"To-morrow morn, and live an anchorite."
10168,RIBERA.,One thing ye cannot rob me of--my work.
10169,RIBERA.,"My name shall still outsoar these low, mirk vapors--"
10170,RIBERA.,"Not the Ribera, stained with sin and shame,"
10171,RIBERA.,"As she hath left it, but the Spagnoletto."
10172,RIBERA.,"My glory is mine own.  I have done with it,"
10173,RIBERA.,But I bequeath it to my country.  Now
10174,RIBERA.,I will make friends with beasts--they'll prove less savage
10175,RIBERA.,Than she that was my daughter.  I have spoken
10176,RIBERA.,For the last time that word.  Thee I curse not;
10177,RIBERA.,Thou hast not set thy heel upon my heart;
10178,RIBERA.,But yet I will not bless thee.  Go.  Good-night.

10181,RIBERA.,ANNICCA (embracing him).
10182,RIBERA.,"What! will you spurn me thus?  Nay, I will bide,"
10183,RIBERA.,"And be to thee all that she should have been,"
10184,RIBERA.,"Soothe thy declining years, and heal the wound"
10185,RIBERA.,"Of this sharp sorrow.  Thou shalt bless me still,"

10194,RIBERA.,"Then I believed; but now my sense is closed,"
10195,RIBERA.,My heart is dead as stone.  I cast thee forth.
10196,RIBERA.,"By heaven, I own thee not!  Thou dost forget"

10210,RIBERA.,'T is better so.  I leave my work unfinished.
10211,RIBERA.,"Could I arise each day to face this spectre,"
10212,RIBERA.,Or sleep with it at night?--to yearn for her
10213,RIBERA.,Even while I curse her?  No!  The dead remain
10214,RIBERA.,Sacred and sweet in our remembrance still;
10215,RIBERA.,They seem not to have left us; they abide
10216,RIBERA.,And linger nigh us in the viewless air.
10217,RIBERA.,"The fallen, the guilty, must be rooted out"
10218,RIBERA.,From heart and thought and memory.  With them
10219,RIBERA.,No hope of blest reunion; they must be
10220,RIBERA.,As though they had not been; their spoken name
10221,RIBERA.,Cuts like a knife.  When I essay to think
10222,RIBERA.,"Of what hath passed to-day, my sick brain reels."
10223,RIBERA.,"The letter I remember, but all since"
10224,RIBERA.,"Floats in a mist of horror, and I grasp"
10225,RIBERA.,No actual form.  Did I not wander forth?
10226,RIBERA.,A mob surrounded me.  All Naples knew
10227,RIBERA.,"My downfall, and the street was paved with eyes"
10228,RIBERA.,That stared into my soul.  Then friendly hands
10229,RIBERA.,"Guided me hither.  When I woke, I felt"
10230,RIBERA.,As though a stone had rolled from off my brain.
10231,RIBERA.,But still this nightmare bides the truth.  I know
10232,RIBERA.,"They watch me, they suspect me.  I will wait"
10233,RIBERA.,"Till the whole household sleep, and then steal forth,"
10234,RIBERA.,Nor unavenged return.

10269,ANNICCA.,No--teach me not to hope.  Within my heart

10444,MARIA.,And all the waves roll over me.  Wrest me from my doom!
10445,MARIA.,Say not that I am lost!
10446,MARIA.,
10447,MARIA.,
10448,MONK.,MONK.
10449,MONK.,I can but say
10450,MONK.,What the just Spirit prompts.  Myself am naught
10451,MONK.,To pardon or condemn.  The sin is sinned;
10452,MONK.,"The fruit forbid is tasted, yea, and pressed"
10453,MONK.,Of its last honeyed juices. Wilt thou now
10454,MONK.,"Escape the after-bitterness with prayers,"
10455,MONK.,"Scourgings, and wringings of the hands?  Shall these"
10456,MONK.,Undo what has been done?--make whole the heart
10457,MONK.,Thy crime hath snapt in twain?--restore the wits
10458,MONK.,Thy sin hath scattered?  No!  Thy punishment
10459,MONK.,"Is huge as thine offence.  Death shall not help,"
10460,MONK.,Neither shall pious life wash out the stain.
10461,MONK.,"Living thou'rt doomed, and dead, thou shalt be lost,"
10462,MONK.,Beyond salvation.
10463,MONK.,
10464,MONK.,
10465,MONK.,MARIA (springing to her feet).
10466,MONK.,"Impious priest, thou liest!"
10467,MONK.,"God will have mercy--as my father would,"
10468,MONK.,Could he but see me in mine agony!
10469,MONK.,[The MONK throws back his cowl and discovers himself as the
10470,MONK.,SPAGNOLETTO.  MARIA utters a piercing cry and throws herself
10471,MONK.,speechless at his feet.]

10473,MONK.,
10474,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
10475,RIBERA.,Thou know'st me not.  I am not what I was.
10476,RIBERA.,"My outward shape remains unchanged; these eyes,"
10477,RIBERA.,"Now gloating on thine anguish, are the same"
10478,RIBERA.,That wept to see a shadow cross thy brow;
10479,RIBERA.,"These ears, that drink the music of thy groans,"
10480,RIBERA.,Shrank from thy lightest sigh of melancholy.
10481,RIBERA.,Thou think'st to find the father in me still?
10482,RIBERA.,Thy parricidal hands have murdered him--
10483,RIBERA.,Thou shalt not find a man.  I am the spirit
10484,RIBERA.,"Of blind revenge--a brute, unswerving force."
10485,RIBERA.,What deemest thou hath bound me unto life?
10486,RIBERA.,"Ambition, pleasure, or the sense of fear?"
10487,RIBERA.,"What, but the sure hope of this fierce, glad hour,"
10488,RIBERA.,That I might track thee down to this--might see
10489,RIBERA.,"Thy tortured body writhe beneath my feet,"
10490,RIBERA.,And blast thy stricken spirit with my curse?
10491,RIBERA.,
10492,RIBERA.,
10493,RIBERA.,MARIA (in a crushed voice).
10494,RIBERA.,Have mercy! mercy!
10495,RIBERA.,
10496,RIBERA.,
10497,RIBERA.,RIBERA.
10498,RIBERA.,"Yes, I will have mercy--"
10499,RIBERA.,"The mercy of the tiger or the wolf,"
10500,RIBERA.,Athirst for blood.
10501,RIBERA.,
10502,RIBERA.,
10503,RIBERA.,"MARIA (terror-struck, rises upon her knees in an attitude of"
10504,RIBERA.,supplication.  RIBERA averts his face).
10505,RIBERA.,"Oh, father, kill me not!"
10506,RIBERA.,Turn not away--I am not changed for thee!
10507,RIBERA.,"In God's name, look at me--thy child, thine own!"
10508,RIBERA.,"Spare me, oh, spare me, till I win of Heaven"
10509,RIBERA.,Some sign of promise!  I am lost forever
10510,RIBERA.,If I die now.
10511,RIBERA.,
10512,RIBERA.,
10513,RIBERA.,"RIBERA (looks at her in silence, then pushing her from him laughs"
10514,RIBERA.,bitterly).
10515,RIBERA.,"Nay, have no fear of me."
10516,RIBERA.,I would not do thee that much grace to ease thee
10517,RIBERA.,"Of the gross burden of the flesh.  Behold,"
10518,RIBERA.,Thou shalt be cursed with weary length of days;
10519,RIBERA.,"And when thou seek'st to purge thy guilty heart,"
10520,RIBERA.,Thou shalt find there a sin no prayer may shrive--
10521,RIBERA.,The murder of thy father.  To all dreams
10522,RIBERA.,"That haunt thee of past anguish, shall be added"
10523,RIBERA.,The vision of this horror!
10524,RIBERA.,[He draws from his girdle a dagger and stabs himself to the heart;
10525,RIBERA.,"he falls and dies, and MARIA flings herself, swooning upon his body.]"
