132,STARVED ROCK,
133,STARVED ROCK,
134,STARVED ROCK,As a soul from whom companionships subside
135,STARVED ROCK,The meaningless and onsweeping tide
136,STARVED ROCK,"Of the river hastening, as it would disown"
137,STARVED ROCK,"Old ways and places, left this stone"
138,STARVED ROCK,"Of sand above the valley, to look down"
139,STARVED ROCK,"Miles of the valley, hamlet, village, town."
140,STARVED ROCK,
141,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
142,STARVED ROCK,
143,STARVED ROCK,"It is a head-gear of a chief whose head,"
144,STARVED ROCK,"Down from the implacable brow,"
145,STARVED ROCK,Waiting is held below
146,STARVED ROCK,"The waters, feather decked"
147,STARVED ROCK,"With blossoms blue and red,"
148,STARVED ROCK,With ferns and vines;
149,STARVED ROCK,"Hiding beneath the waters, head erect,"
150,STARVED ROCK,His savage eyes and treacherous designs.
151,STARVED ROCK,
152,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
153,STARVED ROCK,
154,STARVED ROCK,It is a musing memory and memorial
155,STARVED ROCK,Of geologic ages
156,STARVED ROCK,Before the floods began to fall;
157,STARVED ROCK,"The cenotaph of sorrows, pilgrimages"
158,STARVED ROCK,Of Marquette and LaSalle.
159,STARVED ROCK,The eagles and the Indians left it here
160,STARVED ROCK,"In solitude, blown clean"
161,STARVED ROCK,Of kindred things: as an oak whose leaves are sere
162,STARVED ROCK,"Fly over the valley when the winds are keen,"
163,STARVED ROCK,And nestle where the earth receives
164,STARVED ROCK,Another generation of exhausted leaves.
165,STARVED ROCK,
166,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
167,STARVED ROCK,
168,STARVED ROCK,Fatigued with age its sleepless eyes look over
169,STARVED ROCK,"Fenced fields of corn and wheat,"
170,STARVED ROCK,Barley and clover.
171,STARVED ROCK,The lowered pulses of the river beat
172,STARVED ROCK,Invisibly by shores that stray
173,STARVED ROCK,In progress and retreat
174,STARVED ROCK,"Past Utica and Ottawa,"
175,STARVED ROCK,And past the meadow where the Illini
176,STARVED ROCK,"Shouted and danced under the autumn moon,"
177,STARVED ROCK,"When toddlers and papooses gave a cry,"
178,STARVED ROCK,And dogs were barking for the boon
179,STARVED ROCK,Of the hunter home again to clamorous tents
180,STARVED ROCK,Smoking beneath the evening's copper sky.
181,STARVED ROCK,Later the remnant of the Illini
182,STARVED ROCK,"Climbed up this Rock, to die"
183,STARVED ROCK,"Of hunger, thirst, or down its sheer ascents"
184,STARVED ROCK,"Rushed on the spears of Pottawatomies,"
185,STARVED ROCK,And found the peace
186,STARVED ROCK,Where thirst and hunger are unknown.
187,STARVED ROCK,
188,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
189,STARVED ROCK,
190,STARVED ROCK,This is the tragic and the fateful stone
191,STARVED ROCK,"Le Rocher or Starved Rock,"
192,STARVED ROCK,"A symbol and a paradigm,"
193,STARVED ROCK,"A sphinx of elegy and battle hymn,"
194,STARVED ROCK,Whose lips unlock
195,STARVED ROCK,"Life's secret, which is vanishment, defeat,"
196,STARVED ROCK,In epic dirges for the races
197,STARVED ROCK,That pass and leave no traces
198,STARVED ROCK,Before new generations driven in the blast
199,STARVED ROCK,Of Time and Nature blowing round its head.
200,STARVED ROCK,Renewing in the Present what the Past
201,STARVED ROCK,"Knew wholly, or in part, so to repeat"
202,STARVED ROCK,"Warfare, extermination, old things dead"
203,STARVED ROCK,But brought to life again
204,STARVED ROCK,In Life's immortal pain.
205,STARVED ROCK,
206,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
207,STARVED ROCK,
208,STARVED ROCK,"What Destinies confer,"
209,STARVED ROCK,And laughing mock
210,STARVED ROCK,"LaSalle, his dreamings stir"
211,STARVED ROCK,"To wander here, depart"
212,STARVED ROCK,"The fortress of Creve Coeur,"
213,STARVED ROCK,"Of broken heart,"
214,STARVED ROCK,For this fort of Starved Rock?
215,STARVED ROCK,After the heart is broken then the cliff
216,STARVED ROCK,Where vultures flock;
217,STARVED ROCK,And where below its steeps the savage skiff
218,STARVED ROCK,Cuts with a pitiless knife the rope let down
219,STARVED ROCK,For water. From the earth this Indian town
220,STARVED ROCK,Vanished and on this Rock the Illini
221,STARVED ROCK,"Thirsting, their buckets taken with the knife,"
222,STARVED ROCK,Lay down to die.
223,STARVED ROCK,
224,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
225,STARVED ROCK,
226,STARVED ROCK,This is the land where every generation
227,STARVED ROCK,Lets down its buckets for the water of Life.
228,STARVED ROCK,We are the children and the epigone
229,STARVED ROCK,"Of the Illini, the vanished nation."
230,STARVED ROCK,And this starved scarp of stone
231,STARVED ROCK,"Is now the emblem of our tribulation,"
232,STARVED ROCK,"The inverted cup of our insatiable thirst,"
233,STARVED ROCK,"The Illini by fate accursed,"
234,STARVED ROCK,"This land lost to the Pottawatomies,"
235,STARVED ROCK,"They lost the land to us,"
236,STARVED ROCK,"Who baffled and idolatrous,"
237,STARVED ROCK,"And thirsting, spurred by hope"
238,STARVED ROCK,"Kneel upon aching knees,"
239,STARVED ROCK,And with our eager hands draw up the bucketless rope.
240,STARVED ROCK,
241,STARVED ROCK,*       *       *       *       *
242,STARVED ROCK,
243,STARVED ROCK,"This is the tragic, the symbolic face,"
244,STARVED ROCK,"Le Rocher or Starved Rock,"
245,STARVED ROCK,Round which the eternal turtles drink and swim
246,STARVED ROCK,"And serpents green and strange,"
247,STARVED ROCK,"As race comes after race,"
248,STARVED ROCK,War after war.
249,STARVED ROCK,This is the sphinx whose Memnon lips breathe dirges
250,STARVED ROCK,"To empire's wayward star,"
251,STARVED ROCK,"And over the race's restless urges,"
252,STARVED ROCK,Whose lips unlock
253,STARVED ROCK,Life's secret which is vanishment and change.

261,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"O, you who have gone from the ways of cities,"
262,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"From the peopled places, the streets of strife,"
263,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"From offices, markets, rooms, retreats,"
264,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Pastoral ways, hamlets, everywhere from the earth,"
265,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And have made of the emptiness of your departure
266,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"A land, a country, a realm all your own,"
267,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Set above the hills of our vision, an empire"
268,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Within, around, above our empire of days,"
269,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Of pain and clamorous tongues;
270,HYMN TO THE DEAD,An empire which out of a sovereign silence
271,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Stretches its power over the restless multitude
272,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Of our thoughts, and the ceaseless music of our beings,"
273,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And surrounds us even as the air we breathe--
274,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"O ye majestic Dead, hear our hymn!"

280,HYMN TO THE DEAD,The least of these who has entered in
281,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Your realm, O Death,"
282,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Is greater than the greatest of us,"
283,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And by a transfiguration has been clothed
284,HYMN TO THE DEAD,With the glory and the wonder of nature.
285,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"He has drunk of the purple cup of apotheosis,"
286,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"And passed through the mystical change,"
287,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And accomplished the cycle of being.
288,HYMN TO THE DEAD,He has risen from the lowlands of earth
289,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Into the air on wings of breath.
290,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"He has rejected the shell of the body, feet and hands,"
291,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"He has become one with the majesty of Time,"
292,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And taken the kingdom of triumph
293,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Whether it be cessation or bliss.
294,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"For he has entered into the kingdom of primal powers,"
295,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Being or ceasing to be,"
296,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Even as he has re-entered the womb of nature.
297,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Or he has found peace,"
298,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"States of wisdom, or vision--"
299,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Hail! realm of Silence,"
300,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Whence comes the unheard symphony too deep for strings,"
301,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Hail, infinite Light,"
302,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Darkness to eyes of flesh--

307,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"What are we, the living, beside you the dead?"
308,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"We of daily hunger, daily food, daily ablutions,"
309,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"The daily rising and lying down,"
310,HYMN TO THE DEAD,Waking and sleep;
311,HYMN TO THE DEAD,The daily care of the body's needs;
312,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And daily desire to pass the gift of life;
313,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And daily fears of the morrow to come;
314,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And daily pains for things that are gone;
315,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And daily longing for things that fly us;
316,HYMN TO THE DEAD,And sorrow that follows wherever we go;
317,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"And love that mocks us, and peace that breaks,"
318,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"And shame that tracks us, and want that gnaws."
319,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"But O ye Dead! Ye great ones,"
320,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"Triumphant over these, released"
321,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"From the duties of dust, all chains of desire,"
322,HYMN TO THE DEAD,"And made inhabitants of breathless spaces,"

715,TYRANNOSAURUS: OR BURNING LETTERS,Well--now do we see? Was I dunce

750,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI
751,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
752,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
753,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"No more of searching, Doctor--let it go."
754,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,It can't be lost. I have a memory
755,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I put it in a drawer, or again"
756,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,I seem to see me tuck it in a pocket
757,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Of some portmanteau. If you find the letter
758,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Deliver it to Moore. But if it's lost,"
759,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,The story is not lost. I tell you this
760,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,To save the story from my side. Attend!
761,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,It was this way:
762,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
763,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Allegra had become
764,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"A child requiring care, and nutritive"
765,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Instruction in religion, morals, well,"
766,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"They call me blasphemer and sensualist,"
767,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,But read my poems. Christianity
768,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Was never of rejected things with me.
769,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The Decalogue is good enough, I think."
770,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And Shelley's theories, atheist speculations"
771,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,I never shared--nor social dreams. The scheme
772,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Of having all things, women, too, in common"
773,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Means common women. I have sinned, I know--"
774,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I call it sin. The marriage vow I honor,"
775,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And woman's virtue. Though I stray, I hold"
776,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"That women should be chaste, though man is not."
777,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,That's why I placed Allegra in a convent....
778,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
779,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Now to the letter, and my story of it."
780,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
781,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The mother, Claire, Claire Claremont, as you know--"
782,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Pined for Allegra; would possess the child
783,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,And take her from the convent--where? No doubt
784,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"To Shelley's nest, where William Godwin's daughter"
785,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Raised on free love, and Shelley preaching it,"
786,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And Claire in whom 'tis bred, hold sway, who read,"
787,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Talk, argue, dream of freedom, all the things"
788,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Opposed to what is in the present order.
789,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"You know the notes to ""Queen Mab."" Well, I say"
790,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,This suits me not.
791,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
792,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"So Shelley and his wife,"
793,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Mary, the planet of an hour, since quenched,"
794,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Conceive I keep Allegra where she is
795,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"From wounded pride, or pique. Hell fire! They think"
796,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,I'm hurt for thinking Claire and Shelley join
797,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Their lips in love, and masque my jealousy"
798,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"By just this pose of morals, make reprisal"
799,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Under a lying flag, and keep Allegra"
800,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,To punish Claire and sate my jealousy
801,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,By this hypocrisy--It makes me laugh.
802,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
803,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,But to pursue. A maid who was discharged
804,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,From Shelley's household told the credible tale
805,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"That Claire was Shelley's mistress, and the Hoppners"
806,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Heard and believed--why not? As she is fair,"
807,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And Shelley wrote ""Love is like understanding"
808,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Which brighter grows gazing on many truths,"
809,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Increases by division,"" that himself"
810,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Could not accept the code, a man should choose"
811,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"One woman and leave all the rest, why not?"
812,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"As for myself, I have not preached this doctrine,"
813,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Though living it as men do in the world....
814,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
815,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Oh yes, I know this love called spiritual,"
816,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Of which old maids, whose milk has gone to brain"
817,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And curdled in the process, and who hate me"
818,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"For taking men and women as they are,"
819,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Talk to create belief for self and others.
820,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
821,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Denial makes philosophies, religions."
822,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Indulgence leaves one sane, objectifies"
823,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The eternal womanly, freeing brain of fumes,"
824,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,To work with master hands with love and life.
825,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
826,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The story rose, however."
827,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
828,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Then comes Shelley
829,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Bearing a letter from his wife, denying"
830,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"That Claire and Shelley loved, you understand--"
831,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"By the flesh. Sweet, was it not? Naïve!"
832,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"This letter I should hand the Hoppners, who"
833,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Believed the story, and who held a place"
834,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Persuasive touching poor Allegra. Well,"
835,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"So Shelley comes and makes the point, the child"
836,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Is in ill health, Claire, too, in a decline,"
837,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,And hands this letter to me for the Hoppners.
838,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
839,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And I've misplaced it. Frankly, from the first,"
840,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Had no fixed purpose to deliver it.
841,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,What principle makes me collaborator
842,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,With such fantastic business? To resume:
843,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,He acted like the boy he was. I smiled--
844,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Against the flaming rage that burned his face--
845,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"My mocking smile, he thought, the Don Juan"
846,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Upcurved my lips. I read his very thought
847,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Between words spoken; words that he suppressed:
848,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,It was that I was glad that Claire was ill
849,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Because of that male mood when love of man
850,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Finds sustenance where suffering lays low
851,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The object of desire: If she suffers,"
852,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The man subdues, devours her. She escapes"
853,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"If free of love. Oh yes, and this he thought:"
854,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"That I was glad she suffered, since my glory"
855,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Had failed to hold her, failed to satisfy"
856,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Her noble heart! God's wounds! Why Shelley thought
857,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,She turned to him and with his spirit found
858,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"A purity of peace and sweetest friendship,"
859,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And faith that saves and serves, as men and women"
860,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Are to each other souls to serve and save!
861,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Poor fool! I read it all, or pieced it out"
862,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,With words that I picked up from time to time....
863,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
864,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"There was this further thing: I am a man,"
865,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"So say they, who accepts the dying creed"
866,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,That woman's love is lawless and a toy
867,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,When given if no priest has sanctified it--
868,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Not quite, perhaps. The point is further on."
869,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
870,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"In any case 'tis this: that this belief,"
871,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Mine or part mine, and coloring my acts,"
872,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Shadowed no whit the brow of Lady Claire.
873,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And that I, greatest lover of my time,"
874,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Had won this lady's body but to lose
875,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The lady's soul, a soul that slipped and fled"
876,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Out of the hands that clasped her flesh, because"
877,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"She knew me through her gift, thought less of me,"
878,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,And no wise felt herself bound to my life
879,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Because she gave her body. Kept her mind,"
880,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Soul, free, untouched by that gift, by the gift"
881,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Was cognizant of what is false and poor--
882,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,(I use some words I heard) in me. And thus
883,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I lost her soul, though earlier I had gained"
884,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"What seemed all to me, all I had the genius"
885,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,To comprehend in woman! Then comes Shelley
886,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"And finds her soul, the genuine prize, and I"
887,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Grow sullen with a consciousness of vision
888,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Inferior to his. All this they thought.
889,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Oh Jesus, what a lie!"
890,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
891,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I have loved Nature, love her now: and woman"
892,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Is Nature, and my love for nature means"
893,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Inclusion of the sex. I have not soared
894,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,To heights that sickened me and made me laugh
895,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,At what I sought--or turned from it. No moons
896,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Behind the clouds; no terrors and no symbols,"
897,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,No Emilia Vivianni's have I had.
898,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I know, believe me, love for woman calls"
899,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,A man's soul up to heights too rare to live in.
900,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I have not risen, therefore, will not rise"
901,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Where thinking stops, because the blood leaves brain"
902,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Therefore have had no falls, and no recoils"
903,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Chasing the Plato vision, the star, the wonder,"
904,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The beauty and the terror, harmony"
905,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Of nature's art; the passion that would make
906,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"The loved one of the self-same womb with me,"
907,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"A sister, spouse or angel, dæmon, pilot"
908,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Of life and fate.
909,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
910,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,How much of truth is here?
911,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
912,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Dreams seen most vividly by Petrarch, Dante,"
913,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Who loved without achievement, balking nature,"
914,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Till Passion, like an involute, pressed in"
915,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Harder and harder on its starving leaves,"
916,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Becomes a fragrance--sublimate of self
917,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Sucked out of sorrow's earth, at last becomes"
918,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,A meditative madness. All is written
919,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Fairly across my page. ""She walks in beauty:"""
920,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"""When we two parted,"" ""Could love like a river,"""
921,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"""Bright be the place of thy soul."" Lines, lines"
922,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"In ""Harold,"" ""Don Juan."" Yes, I have loved,"
923,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"But saw how far love lures, how far to venture,"
924,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Knowing what can and what cannot be made
925,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Of the mystery, the wonder, therefore never"
926,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Have had to laugh at self; find Vivianni
927,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,A housemaid shelling corn--not threading pearls.
928,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Or sit, with idiot eyes, my bones half broken,"
929,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Icarus bumped amid a field of stones.
930,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
931,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,I know the hour of farewell. I have said it
932,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"When my heart trembled, stopped as when a horse"
933,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Braces its terrored feet to keep from plunging
934,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Over the precipice. Farewell! Farewell!
935,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"I know to say, and turn, and pass my way."
936,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
937,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Why! For that matter, even now behold!"
938,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,Do I feel less than Shelley would in this?
939,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,I leave the Countess for the war in Greece.
940,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"What's done is done. What's lived is lived. Come, Doctor,"
941,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,"Let's practice with the pistols. Mother of God,"
942,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,What is this thing called Life?
943,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
944,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
945,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
946,LORD BYRON TO DOCTOR POLIDORI,
947,THE FOLDING MIRROR,THE FOLDING MIRROR
948,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
949,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
950,THE FOLDING MIRROR,A folding mirror! What may it be?
951,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Nothing? Or something? Let me see!
952,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Its silver chain is hung to the sky
953,THE FOLDING MIRROR,On a planet nail. And it fronts my eye.
954,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"No stars reflect themselves at first,"
955,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"The mirrors are dustless, vacant and clean."
956,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Not even my face shows--am I cursed?
957,THE FOLDING MIRROR,What may the mirrors mean?
958,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
959,THE FOLDING MIRROR,*       *       *       *       *
960,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
961,THE FOLDING MIRROR,I watch like a cat that waits to mangle
962,THE FOLDING MIRROR,A breathless rat in an alley nook.
963,THE FOLDING MIRROR,And a little figure steps into the angle
964,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Made by the folding mirrors. Look!
965,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"His thin legs wobble, bend and dangle"
966,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Like radish roots. He takes the crook
967,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Out of his arms and raises them up,"
968,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"As if in panic, or supplication."
969,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"He bends and peers, whines like a pup,"
970,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Walks to and fro in his desperation,"
971,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Pinches his arms and beats his breast;
972,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Runs quivering fingers between his hair,"
973,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Wavers for weariness, sighs for rest,"
974,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Looks up to the planet that seems to bear
975,THE FOLDING MIRROR,The silver chain like a brad in the wall.
976,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Upsprings, searches the mirrors again;"
977,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Sees for the first the prodigal
978,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Waste of stars in the black inane.
979,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Stamps with his feet upon the void
980,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"He stands on, paces on, why, he wonders"
981,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Is he upborned like an asteroid?
982,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Hark! The limitless blackness thunders:
983,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"The Infinite growls, he whirls and shivers,"
984,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Runs to cover the mirrors to climb.
985,THE FOLDING MIRROR,They yield like the waters of phantom rivers.
986,THE FOLDING MIRROR,He acts like a soul new born that quivers
987,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Before the mirrors of Space and Time.
988,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
989,THE FOLDING MIRROR,*       *       *       *       *
990,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
991,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Now what's to do? He must fill in.
992,THE FOLDING MIRROR,This emptiness with horror is shod.
993,THE FOLDING MIRROR,When did this pageant of things begin?
994,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Somewhere hiding there is a God.
995,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Some one drove that planet nail
996,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Into the blue wall; some one hung
997,THE FOLDING MIRROR,The silver chain. And what is the tale
998,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Of the mirrors here in the blackness swung?
999,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"The soul is naked, weak and alone,"
1000,THE FOLDING MIRROR,And sees its nakedness in the glass.
1001,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"It must create from wood and stone,"
1002,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Wire and reeds, color and brass."
1003,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"It must create though it be but a mime,"
1004,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Make a reality all its own
1005,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Before the mirror of white called Time,"
1006,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Before the mirror of blue called Space.
1007,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Clasp the vastness between their folds,"
1008,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Find laws, raise altars, dream of a face--"
1009,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Make that real which the hope beholds.
1010,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
1011,THE FOLDING MIRROR,*       *       *       *       *
1012,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
1013,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Our terrored manikin commences,"
1014,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Fattens his littleness with clothes.
1015,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"With crowns and miters puffs his senses,"
1016,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Crushes the grape to drown his woes.
1017,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Fills full the mirrors with faces. Now
1018,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"They are dancing before them, age and youth,"
1019,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Laurels or thorns are bound on a brow.
1020,THE FOLDING MIRROR,They hunt and slay for a thing called Truth.
1021,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Dig for treasure, toil for riches,"
1022,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Struggle for place--it is well enough!
1023,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Some lift their busts into chosen niches.
1024,THE FOLDING MIRROR,All are hungry for peace and love.
1025,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"And only a few are blind, dispute"
1026,THE FOLDING MIRROR,The thing is a dream. If there be worth
1027,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"It lies in the strings of the lyre or lute,"
1028,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Sounds that never return to earth;
1029,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Dreams to seeing eyes reflected,"
1030,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Caught from infinite realms afar.
1031,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"How could they be seen, or recollected"
1032,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Except for the Real--except for a Star?
1033,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
1034,THE FOLDING MIRROR,*       *       *       *       *
1035,THE FOLDING MIRROR,
1036,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"God in the blackness, whirlwind, lightning,"
1037,THE FOLDING MIRROR,God in the blinding fire of the sun
1038,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Before these empty mirrors brightening

1040,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Out of an astral substance molding
1041,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Music and laws for our hearts' control,"
1042,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Yes, and a hope that the mirrors' folding"
1043,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Lets slip through a growing soul.
1044,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Are you not proud of us, do you not pity?"
1045,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Is all the glory thine alone?

1054,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"Yours the hope where never a prop is,"
1055,THE FOLDING MIRROR,"The opiates, too, that dull, deceive,"
1056,THE FOLDING MIRROR,No less than nature that lifts eternal
1057,THE FOLDING MIRROR,Vision of Life to quiet the heart:

1103,WILD BIRDS,"Cry, exult and stretch their wings."
1104,WILD BIRDS,Out of the sky they drift
1105,WILD BIRDS,And sink to the water's rushes.
1106,WILD BIRDS,But the wild birds beat their wings and cry
1107,WILD BIRDS,To the newcomer out of the sky!
1108,WILD BIRDS,
1109,WILD BIRDS,"Is he a stranger, this wild bird out of the sky?"
1110,WILD BIRDS,Or do they cry to him because of remembered places
1111,WILD BIRDS,And remembered days
1112,WILD BIRDS,Spent together
1113,WILD BIRDS,"In the north-land, or the south-land?"
1114,WILD BIRDS,
1115,WILD BIRDS,"Is this the ecstasy of renewal,"
1116,WILD BIRDS,Or the ecstasy of beginning?
1117,WILD BIRDS,For the wild bird touches his bill
1118,WILD BIRDS,Against a mate;
1119,WILD BIRDS,He brushes her wing with his wing;
1120,WILD BIRDS,He quivers with delight
1121,WILD BIRDS,"For the cool sky of blue,"
1122,WILD BIRDS,And the touch of her wing!
1123,WILD BIRDS,
1124,WILD BIRDS,"The wild birds fly up from the reeds of the water,"
1125,WILD BIRDS,"Some for the south,"
1126,WILD BIRDS,Some for the north.
1127,WILD BIRDS,They are gone--
1128,WILD BIRDS,Lost in the sky!
1129,WILD BIRDS,
1130,WILD BIRDS,In what water do these mates of a morning
1131,WILD BIRDS,Exult on the morrow?
1132,WILD BIRDS,What wild birds will cry to them as they sink
1133,WILD BIRDS,Out of an unknown sky?
1134,WILD BIRDS,To whose cry will she quiver
1135,WILD BIRDS,"Through her burnished wings to-morrow,"
1136,WILD BIRDS,"In the north-land,"

1147,A LADY,"Embroidered with Venetian lace,"
1148,A LADY,Between linens that crush in the hand
1149,A LADY,Soft as down.
1150,A LADY,"Waking, she looks through a window"
1151,A LADY,"Curtained with carnation silk,"
1152,A LADY,"Embroidered with Venetian lace,"
1153,A LADY,The walls are hung with velvet
1154,A LADY,"Embossed with a _fleur de lis_,"
1155,A LADY,"And around her is the silence of richness,"
1156,A LADY,Where foot-falls are like exhalations
1157,A LADY,From carpets of moss.
1158,A LADY,Little clocks tinkle.
1159,A LADY,Medallions priceless as jewels
1160,A LADY,Lie by jars suspiring like coals of fire.
1161,A LADY,"And a maid prepares the bath,"
1162,A LADY,Tincturing delicious water with exquisite essences.
1163,A LADY,And she is served with coffee
1164,A LADY,"In cups as thin as petals,"
1165,A LADY,Sitting amid pillows that breathe
1166,A LADY,The souls of freesia!
1167,A LADY,
1168,A LADY,All things are hers:
1169,A LADY,"Fishes from all seas,"
1170,A LADY,Fruits from all climes.
1171,A LADY,"The city lies at her command,"
1172,A LADY,And is summoned by buttons
1173,A LADY,Which are pressed for her.
1174,A LADY,"Noiselessly feet move on many floors,"
1175,A LADY,Serving her.
1176,A LADY,Wheels that turn under coaches
1177,A LADY,"Of crystal and ebony,"
1178,A LADY,"And yachts dreaming in strange waters,"
1179,A LADY,And wings--all are hers!
1180,A LADY,And she is free:
1181,A LADY,Her husband comes and goes
1182,A LADY,From his suite below hers.
1183,A LADY,"She never sees him,"
1184,A LADY,"Nor knows his ways, nor his days."
1185,A LADY,
1186,A LADY,But she is very weary
1187,A LADY,"And all alone amid her servants,"
1188,A LADY,And guests that come and go.
1189,A LADY,"Her lips are red,"
1190,A LADY,Her skin is soft and smooth--
1191,A LADY,But the page blurs before her eyes.
1192,A LADY,"Her eyelids are languid,"
1193,A LADY,"And droop from weariness,"
1194,A LADY,Though she will not rest
1195,A LADY,From the long pursuit of love!
1196,A LADY,Her hair is white;
1197,A LADY,The skin of her faultless neck
1198,A LADY,Edges in creases
1199,A LADY,As she turns her perfect head.
1200,A LADY,And the days dawn and die.
1201,A LADY,What day that dawns will bring her love?
1202,A LADY,And day by day she waits for the dawn
1203,A LADY,"Of a new life, a great love!"
1204,A LADY,
1205,A LADY,But every morning brings its remembrance
1206,A LADY,Of the increasing years that are gone.
1207,A LADY,And every evening brings its fear
1208,A LADY,"Of death which must come,"
1209,A LADY,Until her nerves are shaken
1210,A LADY,Like a woman's hair in the wind--
1211,A LADY,What must be done?
1212,A LADY,Some one tells her that God is love.
1213,A LADY,And when the fears come
1214,A LADY,"She says to self over and over,"
1215,A LADY,"""God is love! God is love!"
1216,A LADY,"All is well."""
1217,A LADY,"And she wins a little oblivion,"
1218,A LADY,"Through saying ""God is love,"""
1219,A LADY,From the truth in her heart which cries:
1220,A LADY,"""Love is life,"
1221,A LADY,"Love is a lover,"
1222,A LADY,"And love is God!"""
1223,A LADY,
1224,A LADY,She is a flower
1225,A LADY,"Which the spring has nourished,"
1226,A LADY,And the summer exhausted.
1227,A LADY,Fall is at hand.
1228,A LADY,Weird zephyrs stir her leaves and blossoms;
1229,A LADY,"And she says to herself, ""It is not fall,"
1230,A LADY,"For God is love!"""
1231,A LADY,
1232,A LADY,My poor flower!
1233,A LADY,"May this therapy ease you into sleep,"
1234,A LADY,And the folding of jewelless hands!
1235,A LADY,You are beginning to be sick
1236,A LADY,"Of the incurable disease of age,"
1237,A LADY,And the weariness of futile flesh!

1243,THE NEGRO WARD,
1244,THE NEGRO WARD,
1245,THE NEGRO WARD,Scarce had I written: it were best
1246,THE NEGRO WARD,"To crush this love, to give you up,"
1247,THE NEGRO WARD,"Drink at one draught the bitter cup,"
1248,THE NEGRO WARD,"And kill this new life in my breast,"
1249,THE NEGRO WARD,Than Parker's breathing seemed to give
1250,THE NEGRO WARD,Ominous sound the end was near.
1251,THE NEGRO WARD,I did so want this man to live--
1252,THE NEGRO WARD,"This negro soldier, dear."
1253,THE NEGRO WARD,
1254,THE NEGRO WARD,"'Twas three in the morning, all was still"
1255,THE NEGRO WARD,"But Parker's rattle in the throat,"
1256,THE NEGRO WARD,Outside I heard the whippoorwill.
1257,THE NEGRO WARD,The new moon like an Indian boat
1258,THE NEGRO WARD,"Hung just above the darkened grove,"
1259,THE NEGRO WARD,"Where you and I had pledged our love,"
1260,THE NEGRO WARD,"When you were here. Such precious hours,"
1261,THE NEGRO WARD,Such fleeting moments then were ours...
1262,THE NEGRO WARD,"Alone here in the silent ward,"
1263,THE NEGRO WARD,"With Parker dying, I was scared."
1264,THE NEGRO WARD,"His breath came short, his lips were blue."
1265,THE NEGRO WARD,"I asked him: ""Is there something more,"
1266,THE NEGRO WARD,"Parker, that I can do for you?"""
1267,THE NEGRO WARD,"""Please hold my hand,"" he said. Before"
1268,THE NEGRO WARD,"I took it, it was growing cold--"
1269,THE NEGRO WARD,"Death, how quick it comes!"
1270,THE NEGRO WARD,
1271,THE NEGRO WARD,Then next I seemed to hear the drums--
1272,THE NEGRO WARD,For I had fainted for his eyes
1273,THE NEGRO WARD,"That stared with such a wide surprise,"
1274,THE NEGRO WARD,"As the lids fell apart they stared,"
1275,THE NEGRO WARD,As if they saw what to behold
1276,THE NEGRO WARD,Had startled his poor soul which fared
1277,THE NEGRO WARD,"Where it would not. I heard the drums,"
1278,THE NEGRO WARD,"The bugle next, lay there so faint"
1279,THE NEGRO WARD,"With Parker's eyes still in my view,"
1280,THE NEGRO WARD,Like bubble motes which flit and paint
1281,THE NEGRO WARD,Themselves upon the heaven's blue.
1282,THE NEGRO WARD,An orderly had mailed meanwhile
1283,THE NEGRO WARD,"That letter, to you, there I lay"
1284,THE NEGRO WARD,"Too weak to write again, unsay"
1285,THE NEGRO WARD,What I had written.
1286,THE NEGRO WARD,
1287,THE NEGRO WARD,"Down the aisle,"
1288,THE NEGRO WARD,"Between our beds a step I heard,"
1289,THE NEGRO WARD,"A voice: ""Our order's here, we leave"
1290,THE NEGRO WARD,"In half an hour for France."" I stirred"
1291,THE NEGRO WARD,"Like a dead thing, could scarce conceive"
1292,THE NEGRO WARD,What tragedy was come. No chance
1293,THE NEGRO WARD,To write you or to telegraph.
1294,THE NEGRO WARD,"In twelve hours more, as in a trance"
1295,THE NEGRO WARD,"I looked from Ellis Island, where"
1296,THE NEGRO WARD,My chums could gayly talk and laugh.
1297,THE NEGRO WARD,In two hours more we sailed for France.
1298,THE NEGRO WARD,"All this was hard, but still to bear"
1299,THE NEGRO WARD,"The knowledge of you, your despair,"
1300,THE NEGRO WARD,"Or change, or bitterness, if you thought"
1301,THE NEGRO WARD,"That letter came from me, was wrought"
1302,THE NEGRO WARD,Out of a heart that could not stake
1303,THE NEGRO WARD,Its own blood for your sake.
1304,THE NEGRO WARD,
1305,THE NEGRO WARD,I will come back to you at length
1306,THE NEGRO WARD,If I but live and have the strength.
1307,THE NEGRO WARD,"How will you like me with hair white,"
1308,THE NEGRO WARD,"And wasted cheeks, deep lined and pale?"
1309,THE NEGRO WARD,It all began that dreadful night
1310,THE NEGRO WARD,"Of Parker's death, the strain and fright,"
1311,THE NEGRO WARD,The letter it seemed best to write--
1312,THE NEGRO WARD,From then to now I have been frail.
1313,THE NEGRO WARD,"Our ship just missed a submarine,"
1314,THE NEGRO WARD,"And here the hardships, gas-gangrene,"
1315,THE NEGRO WARD,The horrors and the deaths have stripped
1316,THE NEGRO WARD,My life of everything. Is it to prove
1317,THE NEGRO WARD,"For duty, you, though bloody-lipped,"
1318,THE NEGRO WARD,And fallen my unconquerable love
1319,THE NEGRO WARD,"For country and for you through all,"
1320,THE NEGRO WARD,Whatever fate befall?
1321,THE NEGRO WARD,
1322,THE NEGRO WARD,What is my soul's great anguish for?
1323,THE NEGRO WARD,For what this tragedy of war?
1324,THE NEGRO WARD,For what the fate that says to us:
1325,THE NEGRO WARD,Part hands and be magnanimous?
1326,THE NEGRO WARD,For what the judgment which decrees
1327,THE NEGRO WARD,The mother love in me to cease?
1328,THE NEGRO WARD,"For separation, hopeless miles"
1329,THE NEGRO WARD,Of land and water us between?
1330,THE NEGRO WARD,For what the devil force that smiles
1331,THE NEGRO WARD,At man's immedicable pain?
1332,THE NEGRO WARD,
1333,THE NEGRO WARD,I have not lost my faith in God.
1334,THE NEGRO WARD,"Life has grown dark, I only say:"
1335,THE NEGRO WARD,"Dear God, my feet have lost the way."
1336,THE NEGRO WARD,"Religion, wisdom do not give"
1337,THE NEGRO WARD,"A place to stand, a space to live."
1338,THE NEGRO WARD,"I have not lost my faith in love,"
1339,THE NEGRO WARD,That somehow it must rise above
1340,THE NEGRO WARD,"The clouds of earth, I still can rest"
1341,THE NEGRO WARD,In dreams sometimes upon your breast.
1342,THE NEGRO WARD,"But, oh, it seems sometimes a play"
1343,THE NEGRO WARD,Where gods are picking a bouquet:
1344,THE NEGRO WARD,"The blossom of war, my soul or yours"
1345,THE NEGRO WARD,More fragrant grown as it endures....

1433,FOR A PLAY,Afterward her breath invoked the fire--
1434,FOR A PLAY,Breath to breath set burning their desire.
1435,FOR A PLAY,
1436,FOR A PLAY,Is there aught in flesh or is it spirit
1437,FOR A PLAY,Conscious of its kindred soul when near it?

1493,I,On the gray paper of this mist and fog
1494,I,With dust for the erasure and with smoke
1495,I,"For drawing crayons, be this charcoal scrawl:"
1496,I,"The breed of Gog in the kingdom of Magog,"
1497,I,"Skyscrapers, helmeted, stand sentinel"
1498,I,"Amid the obscuring fumes of coal and coke,"
1499,I,Raised by enchantment out of the sand and bog.
1500,I,"This sky-line, the Sierras of the lake,"
1501,I,"Cuts with dulled teeth,"
1502,I,"Which twist and break,"
1503,I,The imponderable and drifting steam.
1504,I,And restlessly beneath
1505,I,"This man-created mountain chain,"
1506,I,Like the flow of a prairie river
1507,I,"Endlessly by day and night, forever"
1508,I,Along the boulevards pedestrians stream
1509,I,In a shuffle like dancers to a low refrain:
1510,I,Forever by day and night
1511,I,"Pursuing as of old the lure of delight,"
1512,I,And the ghosts of pleasure or pain.

1520,II,From a tower like a mountain promontory
1521,II,The cesspool of a railroad lies to view
1522,II,Fouling the marble of the city's glory:
1523,II,A crapulous sluice of garbage and of cars
1524,II,"Where engines rush and whistle, smudge the blue"
1525,II,With filth like the trail of slugs.
1526,II,It is a trench of steel which bars
1527,II,"Free access to the common shore, and hugs"
1528,II,In a coil of lazar arms the boulevard.
1529,II,Cattle and hogs delivered here for slaughter
1530,II,Corrupt the loveliness of the water front.
1531,II,"They low and grunt,"
1532,II,Switched back and forth within the tangled yard.
1533,II,"But from this tower the amethystine water,"
1534,II,"The water of jade or slate,"
1535,II,Is visible with its importunate
1536,II,Gestures against the sky to still retreats

1548,III,Children of the city passing through
1549,III,"To palettes, compasses, the demoniac"
1550,III,Spirit of the city shall subdue.
1551,III,Lions are in the loop and jackals too.
1552,III,"They have no trainers but the alderman,"
1553,III,"Who uses them to hunt with, but in time"
1554,III,The city shall behold its nobler plan
1555,III,"Achieved by hands that rhyme,"
1556,III,"Workers who architect and build,"
1557,III,"And out of thought its substance re-arrange,"
1558,III,Till all its prophecies shall be fulfilled.
1559,III,"Through numbers, science and art"
1560,III,"The city shall know change,"
1561,III,"And win dominion over water and light,"
1562,III,The cyclop's mastery of the mart;
1563,III,"The devils overcome,"
1564,III,Which stalk the squalid ways by night
1565,III,"Of poverty and the slum,"
1566,III,"Where the crook is spawned, the burglar and the bum."
1567,III,These youths who pass the lions shall assuage
1568,III,"The city's thirst and hunger,"

1578,IV,"By the doges, on whose faces"
1579,IV,The city at large never looks;
1580,IV,Doges who could accomplish if they would
1581,IV,In a month the city's beauty and good.
1582,IV,Yet this city in a hundred years has risen
1583,IV,"Out of a haunt of foxes, wolves and rooks,"
1584,IV,And breaks asunder now the bars of the prison
1585,IV,Of dead days and dying. It has spread
1586,IV,"For many a rood its boundaries, like the sprawled"
1587,IV,"And fallen Hephaestos, and has tenanted"
1588,IV,Its neighborhoods increasing and unwalled
1589,IV,With peoples from all lands.
1590,IV,From Milwaukee Avenue to the populous mills
1591,IV,"Of South Chicago, from the Sheridan Drive"
1592,IV,Through forests where the water smiles
1593,IV,To Harlem for miles and miles.
1594,IV,"It reaches out its hands,"
1595,IV,Powerful and alive
1596,IV,"With dreams to touch tomorrow, which it wills"
1597,IV,To dawn and which shall dawn....
1598,IV,And like lights that twinkle through the stench
1599,IV,"And putrid mist of abattoirs,"
1600,IV,"Great souls are here, separate and withdrawn,"
1601,IV,"Companionless, whom darkness cannot quench."
1602,IV,Seeing they are the chrysalis which must feed

1604,IV,Its flight among the stars.
1605,IV,"Beauty is here, like half protected flowers,"

1643,THE WEDDING FEAST,

1799,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Freedom were what to travel you, O Earth,"

1803,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Our life is love unsatisfied from birth,"
1804,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Our life is longing waking or asleep,"

1807,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Grief in my heart and weariness of brain.
1808,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1809,THE DREAM OF TASSO,How did I know these chains and bars are wrought
1810,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of frailer stuff than space, that I could gain"
1811,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"In earth no respite, but a vision brought"
1812,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The truth, O Leonora? It was this:"
1813,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I dreamed this hopeless love, so long distraught"
1814,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Was never caged, but from the first was bliss,"
1815,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And moved like music from the meeting hour
1816,THE DREAM OF TASSO,To the rapt moment of the earliest kiss
1817,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Bestowed upon your hands, to gathering flower"
1818,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of lips so purely yielded, the embrace"
1819,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Tender as dawn in April when a shower
1820,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Quenches with gentleness each flowering place;
1821,THE DREAM OF TASSO,So were your tears of gladness--so my hands
1822,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Which stroked your golden hair, your sunny face,"
1823,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Even as flying clouds o'er mountain lands
1824,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Caress with fleeting love the morning sun.
1825,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1826,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Now I was with you, and by your commands."
1827,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Your love was mine at last completely won,"
1828,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And waited but the blossom. How you sang,"
1829,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Laughed, ran about your palace rooms and none"
1830,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Closed doors against me, desks and closets sprang"
1831,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"To my touch open, all your secrets lay"
1832,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Revealed to me in gladness--and this pang
1833,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Which I had borne in bitterness day by day
1834,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Was gone, nor could I bring it back, or think"
1835,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"How it had been, or why--this heart so gay"

1839,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Look! Every room
1840,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Had blooms your hands had gathered white and pink,"
1841,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And drained from precious vases their perfume.
1842,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And fruits were heaped for me in golden bowls,"
1843,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And tapestries from many an Asian loom
1844,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Were hung for me, and our united souls"
1845,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Shone over treasure books--how glad you were
1846,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"To listen to my epic, from the scrolls"
1847,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of Jerusalem, the holy sepulcher."
1848,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Still as a shaft of light you sat and heard
1849,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"With veilèd eyes which tears could scarcely blur,"
1850,THE DREAM OF TASSO,But flowed upon your cheek with every word.
1851,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And your hand reached for mine--you did not speak,"
1852,THE DREAM OF TASSO,But let your silence tell how you were stirred
1853,THE DREAM OF TASSO,By love for me and wonder! What to seek
1854,THE DREAM OF TASSO,In earth and heaven more? Heaven at last
1855,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Was mine on earth, and for a sacred week"
1856,THE DREAM OF TASSO,This heaven all of heaven.
1857,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1858,THE DREAM OF TASSO,So it passed
1859,THE DREAM OF TASSO,This week with you--you served me ancient wine.
1860,THE DREAM OF TASSO,We sat across a table where you cast
1861,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"A cloth of chikku, or we went to dine"
1862,THE DREAM OF TASSO,There in the stately room of heavy plate.
1863,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Or tiring of the rooms, the day's decline"
1864,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Beheld us by the river to await
1865,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The evening planet, where in elfin mood"
1866,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"You whistled like the robin to its mate,"
1867,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And won its answering call. Then through the wood
1868,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"We wandered back in silence hand in hand,"
1869,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And reached the sacred portal with our blood
1870,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Running so swift no ripples stirred the sand
1871,THE DREAM OF TASSO,To figures of reflection.
1872,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1873,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Once again
1874,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Within your room of books, upon the stand"
1875,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The reading lights are brought to us, and then"
1876,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"You read to me from Plato, and my heart"
1877,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Breathes like a bird at rest; the world of men,"
1878,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Strife, hate, are all forgotten in this art"
1879,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of life made perfect. Or when weariness
1880,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Comes over us, you dim the lamp and start"
1881,THE DREAM OF TASSO,The blue light back of Dante's bust to bless
1882,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Our twilight with its beauty.
1883,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1884,THE DREAM OF TASSO,So the time
1885,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Passes too quickly--our poor souls possess
1886,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Beauty and love a moment--and our rhyme
1887,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Which captures it, creates the illusion love"
1888,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Has permanence, when even at its prime"
1889,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Decay has taken it from the light above,"
1890,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Or darkness underneath.
1891,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1892,THE DREAM OF TASSO,I must recur
1893,THE DREAM OF TASSO,To our first sleep and all the bliss thereof.
1894,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"How did you first come to me, how confer"
1895,THE DREAM OF TASSO,On me your beauty? That first night it was
1896,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The blue light back of Dante, but a blur"
1897,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of golden light our spirits, when you pass"
1898,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Your hand across my brow, our souls go out"
1899,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"To meet each other, leave as wilted grass"
1900,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Our emptied bodies. Then we grow devout,"
1901,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And kneel and pray together for the gift
1902,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of love from heaven, and to banish doubt"
1903,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of change or faithlessness. Then with a swift
1904,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Arising from the prayer you disappear.
1905,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I sleep meanwhile, you come again and lift"
1906,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"My head against your bosom, bringing near"
1907,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"A purple robe for me, and say, ""Wear this,"
1908,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And to your chamber go."" And thus I hear,"
1909,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And leave you; on my couch, where calm for bliss"
1910,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I wait for you and listen, hear your feet"
1911,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Whisper their secret to the tapestries
1912,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of your ecstatic coming--O my sweet!
1913,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I touched your silken gown, where underneath"
1914,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Your glowing flesh was dreaming, made complete"
1915,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"My rapture by upgathering, quick of breath,"
1916,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Your golden ringlets loosened--and at last
1917,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Hold you in love's embrace--would it were Death!...
1918,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"For soon 'twixt love and sleep the night was past,"
1919,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And dawn cob-webbed the chamber. Then I heard
1920,THE DREAM OF TASSO,One faintest note and all was still--the vast
1921,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Spherule of heaven was pecked at by a bird
1922,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"As it were to break the sky's shell, let the light"
1923,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of morning flood the fragments scattered, stirred"
1924,THE DREAM OF TASSO,By breezes of the dawn with passing night.
1925,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"We woke together, heard together, thrilled"
1926,THE DREAM OF TASSO,With speechless rapture! Were your spirit's plight
1927,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"As mine is with this vision, had I willed"
1928,THE DREAM OF TASSO,To torture you with absence? Would I save
1929,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Your spirit if its anguish could be stilled
1930,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Only among the worms that haunt the grave?
1931,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1932,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"My dream goes on a little: Day by day,"
1933,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"These seven days we lived together, gave"
1934,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Our spirits to each other. With dismay
1935,THE DREAM OF TASSO,You watched my hour's departure. On you crept
1936,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Light shadows after moments sunny, gay."
1937,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"But when the hour was come, you sat and wept,"
1938,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And said to me: ""I hear the rattling clods"
1939,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Upon the coffin of our love."" You stepped"
1940,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And stood beside the casement, said ""A god's"
1941,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Sarcophagus this room will be as soon
1942,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"As you have gone, and mine shall be the rod's"
1943,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Bitterness of memory both night and noon
1944,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Amid the silence of this palace."" So"
1945,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I spoke and said, ""If you would have the boon--"
1946,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"O Leonora, do I live to know"
1947,THE DREAM OF TASSO,This hope too passionate made consummate?--
1948,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Yet if it be I shall return, nor go"
1949,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"But to return to you, and make our fate"
1950,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Bound fast for life."" How happy was your smile,"
1951,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Your laughter soon,--and then from door to gate"
1952,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I passed and left you, to be gone awhile"
1953,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Around Ferrara.
1954,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1955,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"In three days, it seemed,"
1956,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I came again, and as I walked each mile"
1957,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Counting to self--my feet lagged as I dreamed--
1958,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And said ten miles, nine miles, eight miles, at last"
1959,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"One mile, so many furlongs, then I dreamed"
1960,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Your reading lamps were lighted for me, cast"
1961,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Their yellow beams upon the mid-night air.
1962,THE DREAM OF TASSO,But oh my heart which stopped and stood aghast
1963,THE DREAM OF TASSO,To see the lamp go out and note the glare
1964,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of blue light set behind the Dante mask!
1965,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Who wore my robe of purple false and fair?
1966,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Who drank your precious vintage from the flask
1967,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Roman and golden whence I drank so late?
1968,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Who held you in his arms and thus could ask?
1969,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Receive your love? Mother of God! What fate
1970,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Was mine beneath the darkness of that sky,"
1971,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"There at your door who could not leave or wait,"
1972,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And heard the bird of midnight's desolate cry?
1973,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And saw at last the blue light quenched, and saw"
1974,THE DREAM OF TASSO,A taper lighted in my chamber--why
1975,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"This treachery, Leonora? Why withdraw"
1976,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The love you gave, or eviler, lead me here,"
1977,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"O sorceress, before whom heaven's law"
1978,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Breaks and is impotent--whose eyes no tear
1979,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of penitence shall know, whose spirit fares"
1980,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Free, without consequence, as a child could sear"
1981,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Its fellow's hands with flame, or unawares,"
1982,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Or with premeditation, and then laugh and turn"
1983,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Upon its play. For you, light heart, no snares"
1984,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Or traps of conscience wait, who thus could spurn"
1985,THE DREAM OF TASSO,A love invited.
1986,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
1987,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Thus about your lawn
1988,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"I listened till the stars had ceased to burn,"
1989,THE DREAM OF TASSO,But when I saw the imminence of the dawn
1990,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"And heard our bird cry, I could stand no more,"
1991,THE DREAM OF TASSO,My heart broke and I fled and wandered on
1992,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Down through the valley by the river's shore.
1993,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"For when the bird cried, did you wake with him?"
1994,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Did you two gaze as we had gazed before
1995,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Upon that blissful morning? I was dim
1996,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of thought and spirit, by the river lay"
1997,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Watching the swallows over the water skim,"
1998,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And plucking leaves from weeds to turn or stay
1999,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The madness of my life's futility,"
2000,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Grown blank as that terrific dawn--till day
2001,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Flooded upon me, noon came, what should be?"
2002,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Where should I go? What prison chains could rest
2003,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"So heavily on the spirit, as that free,"
2004,THE DREAM OF TASSO,But vast and ruined world?
2005,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2006,THE DREAM OF TASSO,O arrowed breast
2007,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of me, your Tasso! And you came and drew"
2008,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The arrows out which kept the blood repressed,"
2009,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And let my wounds the freer bleed: 'Twas you
2010,THE DREAM OF TASSO,By afternoon who walked upon an arm
2011,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"More lordly than mine is. You stopped nor knew,"
2012,THE DREAM OF TASSO,I saw him take your body lithe and warm
2013,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Close to his breast, yes, even where we had stood"
2014,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Upon our day, embraced--feed on the charm"
2015,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of widened eyes and swiftly coursing blood.
2016,THE DREAM OF TASSO,I watched you walk away and disappear
2017,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"In the deep verdure of the river wood,"
2018,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Too faint to rise and fly, crushed by the fear"
2019,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of madness, sudden death!"
2020,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2021,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"This was my dream,"
2022,THE DREAM OF TASSO,From which I woke and saw again the sheer
2023,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Walls of my prison, which no longer seem"
2024,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"The agony they did, even though the cell"
2025,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Is the hard penalty and the cursed extreme
2026,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Hate in return for love. But oh you hell,"
2027,THE DREAM OF TASSO,You boundless earth to wander in and brood--
2028,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Great prison house of grief in which to dwell,"
2029,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Remembering love forgotten, pride subdued,"
2030,THE DREAM OF TASSO,And love desired and found and lost again.
2031,THE DREAM OF TASSO,That is the prison which no fortitude
2032,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Can suffer, and the never dying pain"
2033,THE DREAM OF TASSO,From which the spacious luring of the earth
2034,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Tempts flight for spirit freedom, but in vain!"
2035,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2036,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Ah Leonora! Even from our birth
2037,THE DREAM OF TASSO,We build our prisons! What are walls like these
2038,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Beside the walls of memory, or the dearth"
2039,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of hope in all this life, the agonies"
2040,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Of spiritual chains and gloom? I suffer less,"
2041,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"Imprisoned thus, than if the memories"
2042,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Of love bestowed and love betrayed should press
2043,THE DREAM OF TASSO,Round my unresting steps. And I send up
2044,THE DREAM OF TASSO,"To heaven thanks that spared that bitterness,"
2045,THE DREAM OF TASSO,That garden of the soul's reluctant cup!
2046,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2047,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2048,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2049,THE DREAM OF TASSO,
2050,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN
2051,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2052,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2053,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,He hears his father pray when he's a boy:
2054,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"""Jesus we know, the Savior, and we ask,"
2055,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"In Thy great plenitude of mercy, grace,"
2056,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Forgiveness for our waywardness; we invoke
2057,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Thy blessing, and may righteousness and peace"
2058,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Prevail in all the earth. Meekly we rest
2059,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Upon the precious promise of Thy word.
2060,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Gather us home with Thine own people, Lord,"
2061,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And all the glory shall be Thine."""
2062,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2063,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,So much
2064,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To show the father's prayer which he heard.
2065,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The father is a saint, a quietist,"
2066,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Save that he has his hatreds, strong enough:"
2067,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Turns face of stone and silence to the men
2068,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Whose ways of life are laid in sin, he thinks"
2069,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And calls them dirty dogs and scalawags,"
2070,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Because they vote a ticket he dislikes,"
2071,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Or love a game of cards, a glass of beer,"
2072,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Or go to see the County Fair, where once"
2073,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,A drunken bus-man drives upon a boy
2074,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And kills him. Then the saint is all aflame,"
2075,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And tries to have the fair put out for good.
2076,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And so the son, who will become at last"
2077,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The Christian Statesman, hears his father pray,"
2078,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And prays himself, and takes the lesson in"
2079,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Of godliness, the Bible as the source"
2080,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Of truth infallible, divine."
2081,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2082,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,This boy
2083,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Is blessed with health, a body without flaw,"
2084,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"His forehead is a little low, perhaps,"
2085,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And has a transverse dent which keeps the brain
2086,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Shaped to the skull; a perfect brain is sphered,"
2087,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,As perfect things are circles; but a brain
2088,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Something below perfection, which is fed"
2089,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"By a great body and an obdurate will,"
2090,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And sense of moral purpose will go far,"
2091,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Farther than better brains in craft of states,"
2092,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"For some years anyway, if a voice be given"
2093,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Which reaches to the largest crowded room,"
2094,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To speak the passionate moralities
2095,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Which come into that brain creased straight across
2096,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The forehead with a dent.
2097,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2098,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"He goes to school,"
2099,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And from the first believes he has a mission
2100,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"To make the world a better place, avows"
2101,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"His mission in the world, bends all his strength"
2102,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"To make his armor ready: health of body,"
2103,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A blameless life, hard studies, practices"
2104,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,With word and voice.
2105,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2106,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,It is a country college
2107,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Where he matriculates--the father wished it;
2108,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A college where the boys are mostly poor,"
2109,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And waste no time, have not the cash to buy"
2110,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Delight, if they desired."
2111,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2112,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,He ruminates
2113,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Upon the pebbles and Demosthenes,"
2114,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And sets his will to be an orator
2115,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,That he may herald truth and save the world.
2116,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"After much toil, re-writing, he delivers"
2117,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A speech he calls, ""Ich Dien,"" and loses out"
2118,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Against a youth who speaks on Liberty.
2119,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And then he uses Gladstone for his theme,"
2120,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The Christian Statesman; for exordium
2121,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Tells of the ermine which will die before
2122,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,It suffers soilure--that was Gladstone--yes!
2123,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,But still he cannot win the prize; a boy
2124,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Who talks about the labors of Charles Darwin,"
2125,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"His suffering and sacrifice, is awarded"
2126,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The prize this time--a boy who had the wit
2127,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To speak in praise of Darwin's virtues--saying
2128,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Nothing about his hellish doctrines, thus"
2129,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Winning the cautious judges to his theme.
2130,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2131,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"But is our little Gladstone crushed, dismayed?"
2132,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,He plucks up further strength and takes a hint:
2133,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,A larger subject may bring down the prize.
2134,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,He thinks of Thomas Jefferson--but then
2135,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Jefferson was a deist, took the Bible"
2136,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And cut out everything but Jesus' words.
2137,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"""Yet I can speak on what was good in him,"
2138,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"His work for liberty, the Declaration,"
2139,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And close my eyes to all his heterodoxy."""
2140,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Then something of this plan crept like a snake
2141,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Into his brain, he petted it with hands:"
2142,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Be ye as wise as serpents, and as doves"
2143,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Harmless, he smiled--and went to work again,"
2144,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And won the prize.
2145,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2146,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And now he has stepped forth
2147,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Into the world's arena to become
2148,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A Savior, an evangel, as he thinks,"
2149,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,In truth a pest. He runs for Congress first
2150,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And when his manager takes out a check
2151,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And shows him, given by the local brewery,"
2152,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Another check a bank gives, he maintains"
2153,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A smiling silence, thinking to himself,"
2154,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Jesus accepted gifts from publicans,"
2155,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And if I am elected then this money,"
2156,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"However dirty, will be purified"
2157,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,By what I do.
2158,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2159,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,But then he was defeated.
2160,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,He thinks the banks and breweries did the trick.
2161,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"In truth they knew the Christian Statesman, knew"
2162,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The oleaginous smile and silver voice
2163,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Concealed the despot. Did he scourge them then?
2164,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Well, scarcely then--he wrote a public letter"
2165,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And said the people had decided it.
2166,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And what the people said was law. He nerved
2167,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,His purpose for another trial--that body
2168,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,So big and flawless could not be exhausted--
2169,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"That voice still carried to the farthest corner,"
2170,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,That oily smile deceived the multitude
2171,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"That he was hurt, embittered, only waited"
2172,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"To see if body, voice and oily smile"
2173,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Could win by any means; if not, the scourge"
2174,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Would be brought forth, the smile dropped, the complaints"
2175,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Against the breweries, what not, opened up,"
2176,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Unmasked. For when your hope is gone, you're free"
2177,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To scold and tell your bitterness.
2178,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2179,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And then
2180,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"He made a third and last attempt, though edging"
2181,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Toward the sophistry that moral questions
2182,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Make those political, and by this means"
2183,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Trying to win the churches. Still he stuck
2184,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"To matters economic, as before"
2185,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Took what the breweries gave to help his cause,"
2186,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,His campaign fund. By this time many more
2187,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Had found him out, and knew him for a voice"
2188,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And tireless body nourishing a brain
2189,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"As mediocre as the world contained,"
2190,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And only making louder noise because
2191,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Of body strong and voice mellifluous.
2192,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,They put him down for good: the Christian Statesman
2193,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Had cause to think he was no statesman, or"
2194,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"No Christian, or the electorate not Christian."
2195,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And so he took the mask off, dropped the smile,"
2196,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And let his mouth set like a concrete crack
2197,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And went about to punish men, while seeming"
2198,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To save the world.
2199,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2200,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Out of that indentation,"
2201,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"That fosse of mediocrity, came up"
2202,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"A crocodile with wagging tail upreared,"
2203,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And smile toothed to the gullet--it was this:
2204,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Questions political are moral questions,"
2205,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And moral questions are political,"
2206,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And terms convertible are equipollent,"
2207,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And wholly true. Therefore, I rise to preach"
2208,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"To moral America, draw audiences"
2209,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"In churches, of the churches. If I win"
2210,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Majorities upon--no matter what--
2211,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,A law will blossom; as all moral questions
2212,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Are equally political, procure"
2213,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,For their adoption the majority.
2214,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Upon this fortress I can stand and shoot--
2215,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Who can attack me, since I seek for self"
2216,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Nothing, but for my country righteousness?"
2217,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,And as an instrument of God I punish
2218,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,My enemies as well.
2219,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,
2220,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Who are my enemies?
2221,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The intelligencia, as they call themselves,"
2222,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Who flaunt the Bible wholly or in part,"
2223,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Or try to say that Darwin's evolution
2224,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Honors the Deity more than Genesis.
2225,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Who are my enemies? The thinkers, yes,"
2226,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The strivers for a higher culture, yes,"
2227,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The scorners of old fashioned ways, the things"
2228,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Really American!--I know the crowd--
2229,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"That smart minority I overwhelm,"
2230,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Blot out, drown out, by massing under me"
2231,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The great majority, the common folk,"
2232,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Believers in the Bible--first for them!
2233,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"And on the way the vile saloon I crush,"
2234,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The abominable brewery--then I take away
2235,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"From banqueters and diners, diners out,"
2236,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"The seekers after happiness, not God,"
2237,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,The cocktail and the wine they love so well.
2238,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"This is a moral question, being so"
2239,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Is also a political--the majority
2240,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"Can do what they desire. I am consistent,"
2241,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"For from the first I've preached the people's rule,"
2242,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Abided by the people's voice and taken
2243,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,Defeat with grace because the people gave it.
2244,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,So now I say the people have the right
2245,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,To pass upon all questions. As I said
2246,THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN,"When starting as a public man, the people"

2652,OH YOU SABBATARIANS!,And your cowardice and your fears

2803,AT SAGAMORE HILL,AT SAGAMORE HILL
2804,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2805,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2806,AT SAGAMORE HILL,All things proceed as though the stage were set
2807,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"For acts arranged. I have not learned the part,"
2808,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The day enacts itself. I take the tube,"
2809,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Find daylight at Jamaica, know the place"
2810,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Through some rehearsal, all the country know"
2811,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Which glides along the window, is not seen"
2812,AT SAGAMORE HILL,For definite memory. At Oyster Bay
2813,AT SAGAMORE HILL,A taxi stands in readiness; in a trice
2814,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"We circle strips of water, slopes of hills,"
2815,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Climb where a granite wall supports a hill,"
2816,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A mass of blossoms, ripening berries, too,"
2817,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"And enter at a gate, go up a drive,"
2818,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Shadowed by larches, cedars, silver willows."
2819,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"This taxi just ahead is in the play,"
2820,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Is here in life as I had seen it in
2821,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The crystal of prevision, reaches first"
2822,AT SAGAMORE HILL,The porte cochere. This moment from the door
2823,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Comes Roosevelt, and greets the man who leaves"
2824,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The taxi just ahead, then waits for me,"
2825,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Puts a strong hand that softens into mine,"
2826,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"And says, O, this is bully!"
2827,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2828,AT SAGAMORE HILL,We go in.
2829,AT SAGAMORE HILL,He leaves my antecessor in a room
2830,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Somewhere along the hall, and comes to me"
2831,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Who wait him in the roomy library.
2832,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"How are those lovely daughters? Oh, by George!"
2833,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"I thought I might forget their names, I know--"
2834,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"It's Madeline and Marcia. Yes, you know"
2835,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Corinne adores the picture which you sent
2836,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Of Madeline--your boy, too? In the war!"
2837,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"That's bully--tea is coming--we must talk,"
2838,AT SAGAMORE HILL,I have five hundred things to ask you--set
2839,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The tea things on this table, Anna--now,"
2840,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Do you take sugar, lemon? O, you smoke!"
2841,AT SAGAMORE HILL,I'll give you a cigar.
2842,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2843,AT SAGAMORE HILL,The talk begins.
2844,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"He's dressed in canvas khaki, flannel shirt,"
2845,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Laced boots for farming, chopping trees, perhaps;"
2846,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A stocky frame, curtains of skin on cheeks"
2847,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Drained slightly of their fat; gash in the neck
2848,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Where pus was emptied lately; one eye dim,"
2849,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And growing dimmer; almost blind in that.
2850,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And when he walks he rolls a little like
2851,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A man whose youth is fading, like a cart"
2852,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"That rolls when springs are old. He is a moose,"
2853,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Scarred, battered from the hunters, thickets, stones;"
2854,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Some finest tips of antlers broken off,"
2855,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And eyes where images of ancient things
2856,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Flit back and forth across them, keeping still"
2857,AT SAGAMORE HILL,A certain slumberous indifference
2858,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Or wisdom, it may be."
2859,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2860,AT SAGAMORE HILL,But then the talk!
2861,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Bronze dolphins in a fountain cannot spout
2862,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"More streams at once: Of course the war, the emperor,"
2863,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"America in the war, his sons in France,"
2864,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The dangers, separation, let them go!"
2865,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The fate has been appointed--to our task,"
2866,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Live full our lives with duty, go to sleep!"
2867,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"For I say, he exclaims, the man who fears"
2868,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"To die should not be born, nor left to live."
2869,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"It's Celtic poetry, free verse. He says:"
2870,AT SAGAMORE HILL,You nobly celebrate in your Spoon River
2871,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The pioneers, the soldiers of the past,"
2872,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Why do you flout our Philippine adventure?
2873,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"No difference, Colonel, in the stock, the difference"
2874,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Lies in the causes. Well, another stream:"
2875,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Mark Hanna, Quay and others, what I hate,"
2876,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"He says to me, is the Pharisee--I can stand"
2877,AT SAGAMORE HILL,All other men. And you will find the men
2878,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"So much maligned had gentle qualities,"
2879,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"And noble dreams. Poor Quay, he loved the Indians,"
2880,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Sent for me when he lay there dying, said,"
2881,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Look after such a tribe when I am dead.
2882,AT SAGAMORE HILL,I want to crawl upon a sunny rock
2883,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"And die there like a wolf. Did he say that,"
2884,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Colonel, to you? Yes! and you know, a man"
2885,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Who says a thing like that has in his soul
2886,AT SAGAMORE HILL,An orb of light to flash that meaning forth
2887,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Of heroism, nature."
2888,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2889,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Time goes on,"
2890,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"The play is staged, must end; my taxi comes"
2891,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"In half an hour or so. Before it comes,"
2892,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Let's walk about the farm and see my corn.
2893,AT SAGAMORE HILL,A fellow on the porch is warming heels
2894,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"As we go by. I'll see him when you go,"
2895,AT SAGAMORE HILL,The Colonel says.
2896,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2897,AT SAGAMORE HILL,The rail fence by the corn
2898,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Is good to lean on as we stand and talk
2899,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Of farming, cattle, country life. We turn,"
2900,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Sit for some moments in a garden house
2901,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"On which a rose vine clambers all in bloom,"
2902,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And from this hilly place look at the strips
2903,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Of water from the bay a mile beyond,"
2904,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Below some several terraces of hills
2905,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Where firs and pines are growing. This resembles
2906,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A scene in Milton that I've read. He knows,"
2907,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Catches the reminiscence, quotes the lines--and then"
2908,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Something of country silence, look of grass"
2909,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Where the wind stirs it, mystical little breaths"
2910,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Coming between the roses; something, too,"
2911,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"In Vulcan's figure; he is Vulcan, too,"
2912,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Deprived his shop, great bellows, hammer, anvil,"
2913,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Sitting so quietly beside me, hands"
2914,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Spread over knees; something of these evokes
2915,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A pathos, and immediately in key"
2916,AT SAGAMORE HILL,With all of this he says: I have achieved
2917,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"By labor, concentration, not at all"
2918,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"By gifts or genius, being commonplace"
2919,AT SAGAMORE HILL,In all my faculties.
2920,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2921,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Not all, I say."
2922,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"One faculty is not, your over-mind,"
2923,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Eyed front and back to see all faculties,"
2924,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Govern and watch them. If we let you state
2925,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Your case against you, timid born, you say,"
2926,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Becoming brave, asthmatic, growing strong:"
2927,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"No marksman, yet becoming skilled with guns;"
2928,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"No gift of speech, yet winning golden speech;"
2929,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"No gift of writing, writing books, no less"
2930,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Of our America to thrill and live--
2931,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"If, as I say, we let you state your case"
2932,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Against you as you do, there yet remains"
2933,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"This over-mind, and that is what--a gift"
2934,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Of genius or of what? By George, he says,"
2935,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"What are you, a theosophist? I don't know."
2936,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"I know some men achieve a single thing,"
2937,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Like courage, charity, in this incarnation;"
2938,AT SAGAMORE HILL,You have achieved some twenty things. I think
2939,AT SAGAMORE HILL,That this is going some for a man whose gifts
2940,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Are commonplace and nothing else.
2941,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2942,AT SAGAMORE HILL,We rise
2943,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And saunter toward the house--and there's the man
2944,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Still warming heels; my taxi, too, has come."
2945,AT SAGAMORE HILL,We are to meet next Wednesday in New York
2946,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And finish up some subjects--he has thoughts
2947,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"How I can help America, if I drop"
2948,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"This line or that a little, all in all."
2949,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2950,AT SAGAMORE HILL,*       *       *       *       *
2951,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2952,AT SAGAMORE HILL,But something happens; I have met a loss;
2953,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Would see no one, and write him I am off."
2954,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And on that Wednesday flashes from the war
2955,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Say Quentin has been killed: we had not met
2956,AT SAGAMORE HILL,If I had stayed to meet him.
2957,AT SAGAMORE HILL,
2958,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"So, good-by"
2959,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Upon the lawn at Sagamore was good-by,"
2960,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"Master of Properties, you stage the scene"
2961,AT SAGAMORE HILL,And let us speak and pass into the wings!
2962,AT SAGAMORE HILL,One thing was fitting--dying in your sleep--
2963,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A touch of Nature, Colonel, you who loved"
2964,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"And were beloved of Nature, felt her hand"
2965,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Upon your brow at last to give to you
2966,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"A bit of sleep, and after sleep perhaps"
2967,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Rest and rejuvenation; you will wake
2968,AT SAGAMORE HILL,"To newer labors, fresher victories"
2969,AT SAGAMORE HILL,Over those faculties not disciplined
2970,AT SAGAMORE HILL,As you desired them in these sixty years.

3037,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3038,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3039,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"As I shall die, let your belief"
3040,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Find in these words too poor and brief
3041,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,My soul's essential self.
3042,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3043,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,My grief
3044,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Down to the day I knew you locks
3045,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Its secret word in paradox:
3046,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I who loved truth could not be true,"
3047,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Could only love the truth and glow
3048,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"With words of truth who loved it so,"
3049,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Even while I dishonored you.
3050,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I who loved constancy was false,"
3051,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And heeded but in part the calls
3052,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Of loveliness for love and you.
3053,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I am but half of that I hoped,"
3054,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And that half hardly more than words
3055,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,I cheered my soul with as it groped:
3056,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,As from their bowers of rain the birds
3057,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Sing feebly, pining for the sun."
3058,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"As I am all of this, by fate"
3059,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Lose what I could so well have won,"
3060,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Life leaves me half articulate,"
3061,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My failure, nature half-expressed,"
3062,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Or wholly hidden in my breast.
3063,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Yes, dear, the secret of me lies"
3064,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Where words scarce come to analyze.
3065,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Yet who knows why he is this or that?
3066,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"What moves, defeats him, works him ill?"
3067,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,What blood ancestral of the bat
3068,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Narrows his music to the shrill
3069,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Squeak of a flitting thing that hunts
3070,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"For gnats, which never singing, fronts"
3071,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"The full moon flooding down the vale,"
3072,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"The perfect soul, the nightingale!"
3073,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3074,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"You have wooed music all your life,"
3075,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And I have sought for love. I think
3076,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My soul was marked, dear, by a wife"
3077,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Who loved a man immersed in drink,"
3078,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Who crushed her love which would not die.
3079,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"If this be true, my soul's great thirst"
3080,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Was blended with a fault accursed.
3081,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,My mother's love is my soul's cry.
3082,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My father's vileness, lies and lusts,"
3083,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"His cruel heart, inconstancy"
3084,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,That kept my mother with the crusts
3085,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Of life to gnaw, are in my blood."
3086,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My rainbow wings I scarce can loose,"
3087,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Or if I free them, there's the mud"
3088,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,That weighs and mars their use.
3089,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3090,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,You have wooed music. But suppose
3091,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The hampered hours and poverty
3092,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Broke down your spirit's harmony,"
3093,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Then if you found you could achieve
3094,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"The music in you, if you could"
3095,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"But pick a pocket or deceive,"
3096,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Which would you call the greater good--
3097,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The music or a sin withstood?
3098,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Suppose you passed a window where
3099,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The violin of your despair
3100,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Lay ready for your hands! At last
3101,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"You stole it as you hurried past,"
3102,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And hid it underneath your rags
3103,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Until you reached your attic room,"
3104,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Then tuned the strings and burned the tags.
3105,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And drew the bow till lyric fire
3106,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Should all your thieving thoughts consume:
3107,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,In such case what is your desire--
3108,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The music or the violin?
3109,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And what in such case is your sin?
3110,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"And if they caught you in your theft,"
3111,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Would you, just to be honest, dear,"
3112,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Forefront your thief-self as your deft
3113,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"And dominant genius, or the ear"
3114,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Which tortured you?
3115,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3116,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Would you not say,"
3117,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Music intrigues me night and day?
3118,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,My soul is the musician's. First
3119,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,In my soul's love is music. Would
3120,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,You falsify to keep your good?
3121,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Deny your theft, or put the worst"
3122,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Construction on your soul, obscure"
3123,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Thereby your soul's investiture
3124,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Of music's gift and music's lure?
3125,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,If you were flame you would pretend
3126,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"What you would fain be to the end,"
3127,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Keep your good name and keep as well
3128,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The violin. May this not be
3129,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,In some realm an integrity?
3130,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3131,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Now for myself, dear, though I lack"
3132,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The gift of utterance to explain
3133,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My life's pursuit and passion, pain,"
3134,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Or why I acted thus, concealed"
3135,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Thoughts that you hold were best revealed,"
3136,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Your eyes to heal themselves must track
3137,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And find my soul's way in its quest
3138,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Followed from girlhood without rest.
3139,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Music is not its hope, but love...."
3140,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And I saw somehow I could lift
3141,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My life through you, and rise above"
3142,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,What I had been. And since your gift
3143,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Of love saw me as truthful, true"
3144,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I kept that best side to your view,"
3145,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And hoped to be what you desired
3146,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"If I but struggled, still aspired."
3147,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"And as for lapses, even while"
3148,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I fooled you with the wanton's smile,"
3149,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,He was my lover till you came
3150,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,To light my life with purer flame.
3151,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Was it, beloved, so great a sin?"
3152,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,He was a practice violin.
3153,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Oh, how I knew this when your strings"
3154,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Sang to me afterward when I slept
3155,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Upon your breast again. I wept,"
3156,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Do you remember? I was grieving
3157,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Neither for him, nor your deceiving,"
3158,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Rather (how strange is life) that he
3159,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Was prelude to your harmony;
3160,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Rather that while I walked with him,"
3161,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"With you I found the cherubim,"
3162,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Left my old self at last with wings,"
3163,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Saw beauty clear where it was dim
3164,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Before through my imaginings.
3165,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3166,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Do you suppose the primrose knows
3167,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,What skill adds petals to its crown?
3168,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,How many failures laugh and frown
3169,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Upon the hand that crosses, sows?"
3170,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,The hand is ignorant of the power
3171,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Obedient in the primrose flower
3172,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,To the hand's skill that toils to add
3173,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,New petals till the flower be clad
3174,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,In fuller glory. What's the bond
3175,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Between us two, that I respond"
3176,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,To what you are? Nor do you know
3177,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,What lies within me fain to grow
3178,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Under your hand.
3179,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3180,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,But if the worm
3181,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Should call itself the butterfly,"
3182,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Since it will soon become one, I"
3183,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Better to be myself affirm
3184,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"That I am Beauty, Truth--for you"
3185,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"I would be Beauty, Truth, imbue"
3186,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Your life with love and loveliness.
3187,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"And you can make me Beauty, Truth,"
3188,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,And I can bring you soul success
3189,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,If you but train my flower whose youth
3190,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Still may be governed, keep erect"
3191,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,My hope in this poor earthen sod.
3192,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,I think this is a task which God
3193,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Appoints for us. We may neglect
3194,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"The task in this life, but to find"
3195,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"It is a task we leave behind,"
3196,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Only to meet it, till we see"
3197,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Our fate worked out in lives to be.
3198,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,
3199,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"O, from my lesser self to spread"
3200,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"My golden wings above your head,"
3201,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Through love of love and you discard
3202,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"The sting, the rings of green, the shard."
3203,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Oh, to be Psyche, passion tried"
3204,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Through flesh, desire, purified!"
3205,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,"Love is my lode-star, music yours--"
3206,BONNYBELL: THE BUTTERFLY,Souls must go where the lode-star lures.

3713,II,He hobbled and clattered as if nothing mattered
3714,II,"Down in his cellar for any strange fellow,"
3715,II,"Bringing up the bottles, clinking, winking,"
3716,II,For the crowd that was drinking.

3740,III,A woman who before was anything but gay.
3741,III,"Never had a lover in her life, so they say,"

3743,III,"She saw a cornet player,"
3744,III,"An idler, a strayer,"
3745,III,"And left her husband furious threatening to slay her,"
3746,III,And cursing musicians who have no honest missions.
3747,III,"So Starling Turner, a belated learner"
3748,III,"Of life as music, laughter, folly,"
3749,III,"Grew suddenly jolly, forgot his melancholy,"
3750,III,"Became a dancer and rounded up the fiddlers,"
3751,III,"Got up a contest of fifty old fiddlers,"
3752,III,With prizes for fiddling from best to middling:
3753,III,A set of fine harness for the best piece of fiddling.
3754,III,"Work stopped, business stopped, all went mad,"
3755,III,"Mad about music, the preachers looked sad"
3756,III,"For music, the like of which the village never had...."
3757,III,"The children in the street were shockingly bad,"
3758,III,And danced like pixies scantily clad;
3759,III,"Knocked away the crutches from venerable hobblers,"
3760,III,"Threw pebbles at the windows of grocers and cobblers,"
3761,III,"Made fun of the preachers, the grammar school teachers,"
3762,III,"Stole spring chickens and turkey gobblers,"
3763,III,Roasted hooked geese in front of the police.
3764,III,"Till the quidnuncs decided it wasn't any use,"

3771,IV,Carpenters orated and expatiated
3772,IV,"On Orphic doctrines and wisdoms long hidden,"
3773,IV,A Swede who couldn't speak began to talk Greek.
3774,IV,There were meetings in the park from dawn to dark.
3775,IV,"And wild talk of razing the village, effacing"
3776,IV,The plain little houses and the town replacing
3777,IV,"With carved stone, columns and temples gracing"
3778,IV,Gardens and vistas the water front embracing.
3779,IV,And others would create a brand new state.
3780,IV,So fire broke out in the strangest places.
3781,IV,The belated traveler beheld elfin faces
3782,IV,"Springing from nothing, to vanish in a second."
3783,IV,Potatoes unthrown went whizzing round corners.
3784,IV,"Voices were heard and white fingers beckoned,"
3785,IV,"Till all the wise ones, doubters and scorners"
3786,IV,"Although they winced, in some way evinced"
3787,IV,That their minds were convinced.
3788,IV,"Something was wrong,"
3789,IV,"The evidence was strong,"
3790,IV,The air was full of song:
3791,IV,"You woke out of sleep and heard a violin,"
3792,IV,A harp or a horn;
3793,IV,And rose up and followed the sound growing thin
3794,IV,At the break of morn.

3803,V,The pasturing flocks were sleeker grown
3804,V,And multiplied in a way unknown....
3805,V,And little Alice bright of eye
3806,V,Dreamed and began to prophesy:
3807,V,"And said the strayer, the cornet player,"
3808,V,"Who took Starling Turner's wife away,"
3809,V,Is coming back at an early day:
3810,V,"Look out, said Alice, to Imogene,"
3811,V,"Red-lipped, bright-eyed, turned eighteen,"
3812,V,You have danced too much on the village green.
3813,V,"Look out for the cornet player, I mean."
3814,V,I know who he is for my eyes are keen.
3815,V,"Your blood is desiring, but yet serene."
3816,V,"I know his face and his bright desire,"
3817,V,Laurel leaves are around his brow;
3818,V,"He carries a horn, but sometimes a lyre."
3819,V,His eyes are blue and his face is fire.
3820,V,"Look out, said Alice, his touch is dire,"
3821,V,"Keep to the house, or the church's spire."
3822,V,
3823,V,
3824,VI,VI
3825,VI,
3826,VI,And what was next? The girl disappeared.
3827,VI,"As Alice feared, no fate interfered."
3828,VI,"A posse collected, hunted and peered,"
3829,VI,"Raced through the night till their eyes were bleared,"
3830,VI,"And looked for Imogene, cried and cheered"
3831,VI,"When a clew was found, or a doubt was cleared."
3832,VI,"A posse with pitch-forks, scythes and axes,"
3833,VI,"Shot-guns, pistols, knives and rifles,"
3834,VI,"Hunts for Imogene, never relaxes,"
3835,VI,Runs over meadows for luring trifles:
3836,VI,The wave of grain or a weed that tosses;
3837,VI,And curse and say what a terrible loss is
3838,VI,"Come to Spring Lake: a wife's enticed,"
3839,VI,And then this fairest maid is abducted.
3840,VI,Why are the innocent sacrificed?
3841,VI,We are a people well conducted.
3842,VI,"What is the curse, or is it the war?"
3843,VI,
3844,VI,Why is it every one here is housing
3845,VI,"Fiddlers, idlers, fancy dancers."
3846,VI,At Milem Alkire's why carousing;
3847,VI,Everything that the good abhor
3848,VI,In lovers and romancers?
3849,VI,"The world is mad, the village is mad,"
3850,VI,Even the cattle bellow and run.
3851,VI,"Old maid, young maid, man and lad"
3852,VI,Have eaten of something half insane;
3853,VI,Such antics never before were done
3854,VI,And never it seems may be again
3855,VI,Under the shining sun.
3856,VI,And now comes villainy out of the fun.
3857,VI,"Come with the torch, come with the halter,"
3858,VI,"Gather the posse, stay nor falter,"
3859,VI,Catch the scoundrel who spoiled our peace
3860,VI,And hang him up in the maple tree's
3861,VI,Highest branch. For what is the law
3862,VI,If it can't slip the noose and draw
3863,VI,This minstrel man to a thing of awe?
3864,VI,
3865,VI,
3866,VII,VII
3867,VII,
3868,VII,Then the pastor said: Talk of the gallows
3869,VII,Is just the thing for it's righteous malice;
3870,VII,And we need hearts with piety callous
3871,VII,"For work like this, I might say salus"
3872,VII,"Populi, but bright-eyed Alice"
3873,VII,Can help us in this matter kinetic
3874,VII,"Who has grown psychic and grown prophetic,"
3875,VII,"Sees round corners, and looks through doors"
3876,VII,And spies old treasure under the floors.
3877,VII,"And I have heard that Alice averred,"
3878,VII,The cornet player's the self-same bird
3879,VII,Who enticed the wife of Starling Turner
3880,VII,And kidnapped Imogene; he will spurn her
3881,VII,"Later for some one else, unless we"
3882,VII,Capture and hang the vile sojourner;
3883,VII,"So now for Alice, he said, and bless me!"
3884,VII,
3885,VII,
3886,VIII,VIII
3887,VIII,
3888,VIII,Alice came out to lead the mob
3889,VIII,Catch the scoundrel and finish the job.
3890,VIII,Down to Fruitport before it is dark
3891,VIII,"Come, said Alice, Joan of Arc."
3892,VIII,"Farmers, butchers, cobblers, dentists,"
3893,VIII,"Lawyers, doctors, preachers, druggists"
3894,VIII,"Hustled and ran in the afternoon,"
3895,VIII,Following Alice who led the way
3896,VIII,"Chanting an ancient roundelay,"
3897,VIII,A wild and haunting tune.
3898,VIII,Her hair streamed over her little shoulders
3899,VIII,Back in the wind for all beholders.
3900,VIII,And her little feet were as swift and white
3901,VIII,As waves that dance in the noonday light.
3902,VIII,"Youths were panting, middle aged men"
3903,VIII,Had to rest and resume again.
3904,VIII,"She ran the posse almost to death,"
3905,VIII,All were gasping and out of breath.
3906,VIII,At last they halted upon the ridge.
3907,VIII,"There! said Alice, beside the bridge"
3908,VIII,"Under its shadow. Look, he's there"
3909,VIII,Weaving lilies in Imogene's hair;
3910,VIII,His musical instrument laid aside
3911,VIII,Now he has charmed the maiden pride
3912,VIII,"Of Imogene who is not his bride,"
3913,VIII,"Come, said Alice, before they hide."
3914,VIII,
3915,VIII,
3916,IX,IX
3917,IX,
3918,IX,"They ran from the ridge,"
3919,IX,Looked under the bridge.
3920,IX,"There! he escapes, said Alice, the fay."
3921,IX,Where? Howled the mob! which is the way?
3922,IX,"There's Imogene wrapped as if in a trance,"
3923,IX,"Said the preacher, there where the waters dance."
3924,IX,I saw as it were a shaft of light
3925,IX,"Steal from her side, vanish from sight."
3926,IX,The cobbler said: it was like a comet;
3927,IX,"The druggist, water by a bomb hit."
3928,IX,"Yes, said the lawyer, I heard a splashing"
3929,IX,And saw a light as of waters flashing
3930,IX,Or a thousand arrows of splendor flying
3931,IX,"I heard a booming, banging, clanging"
3932,IX,"Of a bull's hide string, it was terrifying."
3933,IX,"No, said Alice, this form of light,"
3934,IX,"That stole away and vanished from sight,"
3935,IX,"That was the fellow, said Alice, the sprite."
3936,IX,"Go after him, follow through meadow and hollow"
3937,IX,"The God Apollo, the great Apollo!"
3938,IX,
3939,IX,
3940,X,X
3941,X,
3942,X,"They went to Imogene then and took her,"
3943,X,"Spoke to her, slapped her hands and shook her,"
3944,X,"Asked her who it was that forsook her,"
3945,X,"Why she had left her home and wandered,"
3946,X,"What was the dream she sat and pondered,"
3947,X,"And Imogene said, it's a dream of dread,"
3948,X,Now that the glory of it is fled.
3949,X,"Where am I now, where is my lover?"
3950,X,"God of my dreams, singer and rover."
3951,X,I danced with the muses in flowering meadows;
3952,X,We lay on lawns of whispering shadows;
3953,X,We walked by moonlight where pine trees stood
3954,X,Feathery clear in the crystal flood;
3955,X,He gave me honey and grapes for food.
3956,X,We rode on the clouds and counted the stars.
3957,X,He sang me songs of the ancient wars.
3958,X,He told me of cities and temples builded
3959,X,"Under his hand, we waded rivers"
3960,X,By star-light and by sun-light gilded;
3961,X,By shades where the green of the laurel shivers.
3962,X,"But it came to this, and this I see:"
3963,X,"Life is beautiful if you are free,"
3964,X,If you live yourself like the laurel tree.
3965,X,
3966,X,
3967,XI,XI
3968,XI,
3969,XI,"Then some of them teased her, the posse seized her,"
3970,XI,They tore the lilies out of her hair.
3971,XI,"Back to the village, exclaimed the preacher,"
3972,XI,"Back to your home, exclaimed the teacher."
3973,XI,"You've been befooled, said Alice, the fay,"
3974,XI,"And back went Imogene in despair,"
3975,XI,Weeping all the way!
3976,XI,
3977,XI,

3980,THE BARBER OF SEPO,THE BARBER OF SEPO
3981,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
3982,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
3983,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Trimmed but not cut too short; the temples shaved,"
3984,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Neck clipped around, not shaved, an oil shampoo,"
3985,THE BARBER OF SEPO,You have a world of time before the train
3986,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And when it comes it stops ten minutes--then
3987,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The depot's just a block away.
3988,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
3989,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Oh yes,"
3990,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"This is my own, my native town. But when"
3991,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"I earn the money to get out, I go."
3992,THE BARBER OF SEPO,I've had my share of bad luck--seems to me
3993,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Without my fault, as least life's actinism"
3994,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Makes what we call our luck or lack of luck....
3995,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
3996,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Go down this street a block, find Burney Cole"
3997,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And ask him why I was not graduated
3998,THE BARBER OF SEPO,From Sepo's High School at the time he was.
3999,THE BARBER OF SEPO,It was this way: I fell in love that spring
4000,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"With Lillie Balzer, and it ended us,"
4001,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Lillie and me, for finishing that year."
4002,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"I thought of Lillie morning, noon and night"
4003,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And Lillie thought of me, and so we flunked."
4004,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"That thinned the class to Burney Cole, and he"
4005,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Stood up and spoke twelve minutes scared to death.
4006,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Progress of Science was his theme, committed"
4007,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"To memory, the gestures timed, they trained him"
4008,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Out in the woods near Big Creek.
4009,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4010,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Lil and I
4011,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Sat there and laughed--the town was in the hall,"
4012,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Applause terrific, bouquets thick as hops."
4013,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And when they handed Burney his diploma
4014,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The crowd went wild.
4015,THE BARBER OF SEPO,How does this razor work?
4016,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Not shaving you too close? I try to please...
4017,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Burney was famous for a night, you see."
4018,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"They thought his piece was wonderful, such command"
4019,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Of language, depth of thought beyond his years."
4020,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Next morning with his ears and cheeks still burning,"
4021,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Flushed like a god, as Keats says, Burney stood"
4022,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Behind the counter in the grocery store
4023,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Beginning then to earn the means to take
4024,THE BARBER OF SEPO,A course in Science--when a customer
4025,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Came in and said: a piece of star tobacco,"
4026,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Young fellow, hurry! Such is fame--one night"
4027,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"You're on a platform gathering in bouquets,"
4028,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Next morning without honor and forgotten,"
4029,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Commanded like a boot-black.
4030,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4031,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Five years now
4032,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Burney has clerked, some say has given up"
4033,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"The course in science, and I hate to ask him..."
4034,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"But as for me, there was a lot of talk,"
4035,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And Lillie went away, began to sport."
4036,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"She's been around the world, is living now"
4037,THE BARBER OF SEPO,In Buenos Ayres. Love's a funny thing:
4038,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"It levels ranks, puts monarch or savant"
4039,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Beside the chorus girl and in her hands.
4040,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"I stayed here, did not have to leave for shame,"
4041,THE BARBER OF SEPO,But Lillie changed my life.
4042,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4043,THE BARBER OF SEPO,When she was gone
4044,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"My conscience hurt me, and that very fall"
4045,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"When I was most susceptible, responsive,"
4046,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And penitent, we had a great revival."
4047,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And just to use the lingo: after much
4048,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Wrestling at the Seat of Mercy, prayers"
4049,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And ministrations then I saw the light,"
4050,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Became converted, got the ecstasy."
4051,THE BARBER OF SEPO,I wrote to Lillie who was in Chicago
4052,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"To seek salvation, told her of myself."
4053,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"She wrote back, you are cracked--go take a pill...."
4054,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"I know you've come to get your hair trimmed, shaved,"
4055,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Also to hear my story--you shall hear.
4056,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The elders saw in me a likely man
4057,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And said there is a preacher. First I knew
4058,THE BARBER OF SEPO,They had a purse made up to send me off
4059,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"To learn theology, and so I went."
4060,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4061,THE BARBER OF SEPO,I plunged into the stuff that preachers learn:
4062,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"The Hebrew language, Aramaic and Syriac;"
4063,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"The Hebrew ideas--rapid survey--oh, yes,"
4064,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Rapid survey, that was the usual thing."
4065,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Histories of Syria and Palestine;
4066,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Theology of the Synoptics, eschatology."
4067,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Doctrine of the Trinity, Docetism,"
4068,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And Christian writings to Eusebius.
4069,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Well, in the midst of all of this what happens?"
4070,THE BARBER OF SEPO,A fellow shows me Draper and this stuff
4071,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Went up like shale and soft rock in a blast.
4072,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"My room mate was John Smith, he handed me"
4073,THE BARBER OF SEPO,This book of Draper's. What do you suppose?
4074,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"This scamp was there to get at secret things,"
4075,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Was laughing in his sleeve, had no belief."
4076,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"He used to say: ""They'd never know me now."""
4077,THE BARBER OF SEPO,By which he meant he was a different person
4078,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"In some round dozen places, and each place"
4079,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Was different from the others, he was native"
4080,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"To each place, played his part there, was unknown"
4081,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"As fitted to another, hence his words"
4082,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"""They'd never know me now."""
4083,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4084,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And so it was
4085,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"This John Smith acted through the course, came through"
4086,THE BARBER OF SEPO,A finished preacher. But they found me out
4087,THE BARBER OF SEPO,As soon as Draper gnawed my faith in two.
4088,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The good folks back in Sepo took away
4089,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The purse they lent and left me high and dry.
4090,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"So I came back and learned the barber's trade,"
4091,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And here I am. But when I save enough
4092,THE BARBER OF SEPO,I mean to start a little magazine
4093,THE BARBER OF SEPO,To show what is the matter. Do you know?
4094,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4095,THE BARBER OF SEPO,It's something on the shelf--not booze or jam:
4096,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"It's that old bible, precious family bible,"
4097,THE BARBER OF SEPO,That record of the Hebrew thought and life--
4098,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"That book that takes a course of years to study,"
4099,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Requires Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek and Coptic"
4100,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And epigraphy, metaphysics, not"
4101,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Because the book itself is rich in these
4102,THE BARBER OF SEPO,But just because when you would know a book
4103,THE BARBER OF SEPO,In every character and turn of phrase
4104,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And know what's back of it and went into it
4105,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"You draw the learning of the world, that's all."
4106,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Take Plato, if you will, and study him"
4107,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"After this manner, you will travel far"
4108,THE BARBER OF SEPO,In every land and realm. But this is nothing.
4109,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The preachers are a handful to the world.
4110,THE BARBER OF SEPO,They eat this dead stuff like bacteria
4111,THE BARBER OF SEPO,That clean away decay. The harm is here
4112,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Among the populace, the country, all"
4113,THE BARBER OF SEPO,That makes for life as life.
4114,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4115,THE BARBER OF SEPO,See what I mean?
4116,THE BARBER OF SEPO,We have three thousand people in this town.
4117,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Say in this state there are a thousand towns,"
4118,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And say in every town on every Sunday
4119,THE BARBER OF SEPO,In every year this book is taught and preached
4120,THE BARBER OF SEPO,To every human being from the time
4121,THE BARBER OF SEPO,It's five years old as long as it will stand
4122,THE BARBER OF SEPO,And let itself be taught--what have you done?
4123,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"You have created, kept intact a body,"
4124,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"An audience and voting strength--for whom,"
4125,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"The reformer, the fanatic, non-conformist,"
4126,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The man of principle who wants a law
4127,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And those who, whether consciously or not,"
4128,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Live in the illusion that there is an end,"
4129,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"A consummation, fifth act to this world,"
4130,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Millennium, as they say; and at the last"
4131,THE BARBER OF SEPO,When you get rid of sin (but they must say
4132,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"What sin is) then the world will be at peace,"
4133,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Life finished, perfect, nothing more to do"
4134,THE BARBER OF SEPO,But tend to business and enjoy yourself
4135,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And die in peace, reach heaven. Don't you see?"
4136,THE BARBER OF SEPO,These people are deluded. For this stuff
4137,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Called life is like a pan of bread you knead:
4138,THE BARBER OF SEPO,You push it down one place and up it puffs
4139,THE BARBER OF SEPO,In another place. And so while they control
4140,THE BARBER OF SEPO,The stuff of life through Hebrew influence
4141,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Of duty, business, fear, ascetism"
4142,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And yes, materialism, for it is that,"
4143,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"The dough escaped, puffs out, the best of it,"
4144,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Its greater, part escapes us. So I say"
4145,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"That bible taught in every village, hamlet"
4146,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And all its precepts, curses, notables,"
4147,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Preached fifty times a year creates the crowd
4148,THE BARBER OF SEPO,That runs the country at the bidding of
4149,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Your mediocrities, your little statesmen,"
4150,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Your little editors and moralists.
4151,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"And that's your culture, your American"
4152,THE BARBER OF SEPO,_Kultur_....
4153,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4154,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"I'll finish you with eggs, it's better"
4155,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Than soap is for the hair. You've lots of time.
4156,THE BARBER OF SEPO,I think I'll start my magazine next year.
4157,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Step down this way--over the bowl, that's it--"
4158,THE BARBER OF SEPO,A moment while I ring this money up.
4159,THE BARBER OF SEPO,As I was saying--is the water cold?--
4160,THE BARBER OF SEPO,Now back into the chair--as I was saying
4161,THE BARBER OF SEPO,That book upon the shelf has made our culture.
4162,THE BARBER OF SEPO,We must undo it....
4163,THE BARBER OF SEPO,"Yes, your train is whistling--so long!"
4164,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4165,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4166,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4167,THE BARBER OF SEPO,
4168,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW
4169,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4170,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4171,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Let's sit here very quiet, self-controlled,"
4172,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Talk quietly, under this glorious tree,"
4173,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The internes are too far away to hear.
4174,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,They will stand there if we are calm.
4175,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4176,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,You look
4177,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Much better than you did. And as for me,"
4178,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Since I tried leaping from my window, I"
4179,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Seem on the mend, sleep better, do not feel"
4180,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"So much like running, flying from the fears"
4181,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,As I did three weeks since. Here is my tale:
4182,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4183,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"My first step in this world was as a soldier,"
4184,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Turned seventeen and off to free the Cubans.
4185,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I landed at Matanzas, served my time."
4186,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Oh Liberty! Oh! struggles to make free
4187,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"All peoples, everywhere! And when I saw"
4188,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The American republic move to strike
4189,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The chains of tyranny, I said: I die"
4190,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"For such a cause, or live to see it won--"
4191,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,How glorious! My youthful mind was full
4192,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of Byron, Shelley, Paine, and many more--"
4193,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And when I saw my republic go to war,"
4194,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Just as a good Samaritan, I said,"
4195,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"This is my hour, I'm on the pinnacle,"
4196,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Life is divine at last.
4197,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4198,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,But on a sudden
4199,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"A north wind froze my waters, caught my stars"
4200,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,To points of vision which before had been
4201,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Mixed in the fluent time. We up and stole
4202,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The Philippines, spit on our sacred charter,"
4203,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Turned all the thing to guts, until I heard"
4204,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Their growl alone which I thought spirit voices
4205,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,When we had warred for Cuba! 'Twas enough;
4206,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,What was my country? Just a mass of slickers
4207,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Talking philanthropy and five per cent,"
4208,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"A pious, blundering booby lodged at last"
4209,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,In a great cæcum mouthing Destiny.
4210,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"God, with a leader just an actor-man,"
4211,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Clean shaven, shifty, shallow, whored upon"
4212,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,By mercantilists and their butcher creed.
4213,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I mean McKinley, Hanna. Write it down:"
4214,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They barbarized our Grecian temple, placed"
4215,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Cheap colored windows in its marble walls--
4216,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,May history be their hell.
4217,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4218,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"But as for me,"
4219,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They talked of God so much, I said at last"
4220,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I'll learn all they can teach concerning God.
4221,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"This restless soldier spirit led me on,"
4222,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And just because I sensed the faithless age,"
4223,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Loveless and purposeless except for gold,"
4224,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The adventurer in me began to crop.
4225,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Oh yes, the Cuban business started me."
4226,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And so I went to college to prepare
4227,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"For the ministry, as they thought, go through the course"
4228,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Called theological, saying for the first:"
4229,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"""They'd never know me now."""
4230,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4231,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I see at last
4232,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I am not one but many minds at once,"
4233,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And many personalities. As a boy
4234,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I took the color of the leaves or wall
4235,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Where I was resting, climbing. If in truth"
4236,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I lived three months with an uncle, then they said"
4237,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,You look just like your uncle. When I worked
4238,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Under a lawyer's tutelage, they said:"
4239,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,How much your face resembles his. I knew
4240,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,My face and voice and gestures simulated
4241,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Those I admired or lived with. But besides
4242,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I took a certain pleasure, impish, maybe,"
4243,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"In egging on, agreeing with, the souls"
4244,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Whom I sought out; I used to tell my uncle,"
4245,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"A man of firmest piety, what I heard"
4246,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of blasphemy about the village, just"
4247,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"To hear him deprecate it, look with dark"
4248,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And flashing eyes upon such sin, while I,"
4249,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,With serious face and earnest sympathy
4250,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"With what he felt, was laughing in my sleeve."
4251,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Here is the germ then of my after life:
4252,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The faculty that harmonized my hue
4253,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of spirit with the place, the person, while"
4254,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Something in me, perhaps supremest self,"
4255,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Stood quite aloof and smiled.
4256,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4257,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"But, as I said,"
4258,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"When our Republic left its hill of vision,"
4259,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Descended to the place of herding hogs,"
4260,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"This self of me, the adventurer, rose up"
4261,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And led me forth to play with life, and first"
4262,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"To try theology, as I have said..."
4263,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I was a wonder bred among the crew
4264,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of quiet, gate-toothed, crook-nosed psychopaths,"
4265,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The foul-breathed, thick-lipped onanists who filled"
4266,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The seminary, stared at me to see"
4267,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"How I learned Sanscrit, could defend and rout"
4268,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The atheistic speculations. Well,"
4269,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,What I enjoyed most was to get a crowd
4270,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of celibates and talk of chastity,"
4271,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And get them in a glow, and say to them:"
4272,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The mind is fortified by abstinence,"
4273,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The spirit clarified and lifted up--
4274,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I got a thrill somehow. But all the time
4275,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I knew a girl named Ella. Oftentimes
4276,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Lying beside her I would shriek with laughter
4277,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And she would ask, what is the matter, John?"
4278,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And I would say: I'm thinking of a song
4279,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I heard one time: ""They'd never know me now."""
4280,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And Ella said: If Dr. Simpson knew
4281,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That you were here with me, you'd take a fall"
4282,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Out of the Seminary's second floor....
4283,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4284,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,But I went through and didn't fall. And thought
4285,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"This is a way to live, I'll preach awhile,"
4286,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And see what comes. I took a church and preached,"
4287,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Was known as Smith the eloquent, the earnest."
4288,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,But all the time I heard a voice that said:
4289,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"""They'd never know me now."" When I came in"
4290,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The Sunday School and little children flocked
4291,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,About my knees and patient teachers looked
4292,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"With white, pure faces at me, then that voice"
4293,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"""They'd never know me now"" was in my ear...."
4294,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4295,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Well, to go on, a widow in my church"
4296,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Young, beautiful and rich began to beat"
4297,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Her wings around my flame, and on the Sunday"
4298,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I preached about the rich young man, she came,"
4299,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Invited me to dinner. We commenced,"
4300,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Were married in six months. And to conserve
4301,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Her properties I studied law, at last"
4302,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Was spending days with brokers, business men,"
4303,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Began to tell her that my health was failing,"
4304,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Saw doctors frequently to play the part.
4305,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And then she said: You must resign your charge,"
4306,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Your health is breaking, dear. And I resigned"
4307,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"To spend the time in checking mortgages,"
4308,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Collecting rents:--""They'd never know me now""..."
4309,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4310,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"We went the round of summer places, travel,"
4311,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Saw Europe, China, India and the Isles."
4312,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Near Florence had a villa for a time,"
4313,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Met people of all kinds, when I was forty"
4314,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I had a thousand selves, but if I had"
4315,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A self in truth it was submerged or scrawled
4316,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Like a palimpsest all over and so lost.
4317,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I didn't know myself, was anything"
4318,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"To every one, and everything to all."
4319,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I felt the walking age come on me now:
4320,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A polar bear in a terrible rhythm swings
4321,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"His body back and forth behind the bars,"
4322,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And I would walk in restlessness or think
4323,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of other skies and places, teased and stung"
4324,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"By memories of my other selves, by wonder"
4325,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,About what may be happening here or there;
4326,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,What are they doing now? What is she doing?
4327,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"There were a dozen shes to wonder about,"
4328,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And if you think of one you wish to see,"
4329,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And dream she knows delight apart from you,"
4330,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"You simply thrill, the wings you lost revolve,"
4331,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Like thumbs, vestigial stubs--but there you sit."
4332,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Thank God the aeroplane came on to help,"
4333,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And wipe out distance, for you find at last"
4334,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Distance is tragedy, terrifies the soul"
4335,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,With space which must be mastered by the soul.
4336,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4337,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And so I bought a hydroplane. Perhaps
4338,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Would be upon my lawn at sun-down holding
4339,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"These children on my knees, a lovely picture!"
4340,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Then as a fish darts out of darkened water
4341,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Into a water sun-lit, there would come"
4342,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A thought--we'll say of Alice--in two hours
4343,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,I'd be upon her little sleeping porch
4344,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Two hundred miles away, beneath the stars"
4345,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of middle summer, having killed that space,"
4346,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And found the hour I wanted--hearing too
4347,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"""They'd never know me now"" sung in my ears."
4348,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4349,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And I remember when we were in Florence
4350,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"My tribe had gone to Milan for some weeks,"
4351,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And I was quite alone, too bored to live."
4352,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,One listless afternoon who should come in?
4353,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,My wife's friend Constance--but to tell the truth
4354,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"More friend of mine than hers, for all my life"
4355,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I seemed to have these secret understandings,"
4356,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And was two persons to a twain who thought
4357,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They were the bond, whereas the bond existed"
4358,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Between myself and one, and to the other"
4359,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Was not so much as dreamed.
4360,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4361,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And Constance brought
4362,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A certain Countess with her. In a glance
4363,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"We two, the Countess and myself, beheld"
4364,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A flame that joined our hands. And in a week
4365,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The Countess took me on her yacht to Capri,"
4366,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And round the Mediterranean. No one knew,"
4367,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Not Constance, nor my wife, for I returned"
4368,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Before she came from Milan.
4369,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4370,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Oh that week!
4371,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That breeze that sung the port-holes, waters blue"
4372,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And stars at night and music; and the Countess
4373,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Whose voice was like a lute of gold, who lived,"
4374,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Knew life, was unafraid. She heard me say"
4375,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"""They'd never know me now."" And softly murmured"
4376,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Smiling the while: il lupo cangia
4377,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Il pelo ma non il vizio
4378,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Adding, Qual matto! Something yet remains"
4379,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That makes you charming! Oh the feasts and wine,"
4380,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The songs and poems, till at last too soon"
4381,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,We anchored in the bay of Naples. When
4382,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I saw Vesuvius, then I felt again"
4383,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That sinking of the heart that I had known,"
4384,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That sickness, strange, nostalgia, from a boy,"
4385,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Of which a word again. But now it was
4386,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Precursive of the end, the finished idyll."
4387,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The Countess took my hand, with misty eyes--"
4388,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They let me off and rowed me to the dock,"
4389,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I caught the train to Florence, magically"
4390,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Before I had forgotten, seemed to be"
4391,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Upon the yacht still, was in truth alone"
4392,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Amid the silence of my dining room,"
4393,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Supping alone--""They'd never know me now!"""
4394,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4395,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Later I had the fever, was delirious"
4396,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And saw myself receding as if backing
4397,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Into a funnel toward the little end,"
4398,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And growing smaller as the funnel narrowed
4399,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Until I was so small I held myself
4400,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Within the palm's hand of my other self,"
4401,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Laughed like a devil, scared the nurse to death,"
4402,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Saying ""They'd never know me now--just look!"""
4403,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,My wife too had the fever. I awoke
4404,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Out of this illness, found that she was gone,"
4405,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Had died a week before and for a week
4406,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Had been entombed while I was raving--then
4407,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,If any real self of me ever was it came
4408,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Back to me then. I bowed my head and wept
4409,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And scanned my life back:
4410,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4411,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,What was that in me
4412,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Which made me homesick from a boy right through
4413,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"This life of mine, not for my home, for something,"
4414,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Some place, some hand, some scene, which made me dread"
4415,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"All partings, overwhelmed me with a grief"
4416,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"For ended raptures, kept my brain too full"
4417,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of memories, never lost, that grew until"
4418,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I lost myself, and seemed a thousand selves"
4419,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Wandering through a thousand years, how restless!"
4420,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4421,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Then mutterings shook our skies! Another war,"
4422,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"France, Germany and England, so it seemed"
4423,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Best to return here to America.
4424,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"I gathered up the children--all but one,"
4425,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The boy eighteen escaped me, ran away"
4426,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And joined the English army. Now I saw
4427,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"One self of me repeated, that which went"
4428,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,To free the Cubans! Curse these freedom wars!
4429,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They shipped him off to India, soon he had"
4430,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,His fill of liberty. But I came back
4431,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"And here I am. ""They'd never know me now!"""
4432,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4433,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"For what is left of me, what ever was"
4434,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,To be peeled off to realest core? The soldier
4435,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Gone out of me entirely; long ago,"
4436,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,The dreamer of a better world; the self
4437,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That said I'm on the pinnacle, took arms"
4438,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,To free the Cubans; self of me that hungered
4439,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"For pyramids and mountains, ancient streams,"
4440,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Nile and the Ganges; self of me that turned
4441,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,To be a father holding on his knees
4442,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,A romping bevy; self of me that dreamed
4443,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"One heart, one hand enough, oh even the self"
4444,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That dreamed there is a hand a heart for me,"
4445,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Who found in truth no solace in the wife
4446,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"But only a teasing, torturing recollection"
4447,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"That I had missed the one, or missed the many."
4448,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4449,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"So I was in America again,"
4450,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Had fled the war and plunged into the war:--
4451,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"The waves roared yonder, but the shores were here"
4452,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Where wreckage, putrid monsters were thrown up,"
4453,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Corpses of ancient liberties and bones
4454,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Of treasured beauty; and I saw the Land
4455,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Don every despot weapon, as it did"
4456,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"When I fought for the Cubans, even worse."
4457,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,They shipped my boy to Africa; in spite
4458,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Of censorship I pieced the picture out,"
4459,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Knew what he suffered, how they took his faith"
4460,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And dimmed its flame with ordure. Then came forth
4461,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,That father self of me. I brooded on
4462,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"His blue eyes, gentle ways, sat terrified"
4463,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,And tried to trace the days through and the years
4464,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,When he had slipped from just a little boy
4465,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Into a stripling, soldier finally--"
4466,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"While I--what was I doing? Oh, my God,"
4467,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Living these other selves, oblivious"
4468,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,That this boy was. I'd jump from soundest sleep
4469,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Thinking of him in Africa, and seized"
4470,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,With dreams that I must fly to him. O years
4471,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,Wherein I lost that boy. How could I live
4472,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"So many lives and not lose out of some,"
4473,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"Some precious thing? Well, then I broke at last,"
4474,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,"They brought me here: ""They'd never know me now."""
4475,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4476,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4477,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4478,THEY'D NEVER KNOW ME NOW,
4479,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN
4480,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4481,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4482,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"You call this a world! Cloud cuckoo town,"
4483,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Nephelo coccygia, warp and woof,"

4485,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Since I no longer have the proof
4486,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"To show it isn't opera bouffe,"
4487,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,A moving picture film and scene;
4488,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Stage world, with the glue between"

4490,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Neither violent nor venene.

4493,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4494,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Eheu! The middle of the way too--
4495,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Gethsemane and left in the lurch.
4496,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Storms frowning up the dying day too,"
4497,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Bending a weed that was a birch.
4498,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,I can step right over the tallest church.
4499,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Trumpets have shrunk to trumpet toys,"
4500,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Tottle-te-toot! I hear the clocks
4501,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Ticking in paper breasts. What noise!
4502,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Gorges and towering rocks
4503,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Are just the canvas He employs,"
4504,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"With gelatine rivers and candy lochs,"
4505,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Shored in with painted blocks.
4506,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4507,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,I passed through a jungle where smoky mosses
4508,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Hung from the trees, the crocodile"
4509,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Slept or clambered about the fosses;
4510,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Buzzards roosting, not very vile;"
4511,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Rivers of red-ink shed for crosses.
4512,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Centaurs with arrows file on file
4513,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Drew and shouted: he seems to smile
4514,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Let's make him weep a while.
4515,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4516,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Look out for the lion! Said I, with a scowl,"
4517,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Let the lion growl:
4518,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Cat-gut scraped in the painted wings.
4519,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Does the terrible tiger howl:
4520,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Tin cans and resined strings.
4521,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Do the dead gibber and does the owl
4522,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Hoot where the shroud is slipping, clings?"
4523,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Who pressed the squeaky springs
4524,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,In the death bird that it sings?
4525,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4526,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"And you, sir! Well, one time I was sure"
4527,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,You carried a poisoned dart!
4528,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And now you're empty space as pure
4529,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,As the sky when clouds are blown apart.
4530,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Ether! Radium! Nothing! A cure
4531,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,For grit and dust which start
4532,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Grief in this Waterbury heart.
4533,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4534,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"For I had trod the cobra, found"
4535,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"He is but calico, cotton stuffed."
4536,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"The boa chased me round and round,"
4537,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Hyenas tracked me, licked and snuffed,"
4538,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"And made my poor heart flutter and pound,"
4539,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Until I saw the mirror is all,"
4540,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And the wood became a rare-bit dream
4541,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,With monstrous faces and figures packed.
4542,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"And then you ask: Is the mirror cracked,"
4543,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Or is it so bright that it casts a beam
4544,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Through all the shadow scheme?
4545,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4546,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,One time I saw a river's bank
4547,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Shaved down with spades as sheer as a wall,"
4548,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Wasp holes, snake holes cut in two"
4549,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Brought these molds of earth to view.
4550,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,I turned away where the air was blank
4551,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And here was a thing fantastical:
4552,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Space was cored like the honey comb
4553,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"With forms of things that crawl and roam,"
4554,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Animals, men. As I am alive"
4555,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,I saw the form of a horse and cow
4556,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Edged with air and hollow as space.
4557,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,But a horse and cow began to thrive
4558,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"In just a second, a drifting mist"
4559,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Flowed into the molds before my face.
4560,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"And the animals moved, I don't know how,"
4561,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Out of the all surrounding mesh,"
4562,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Creatures of bone and flesh!
4563,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4564,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And it was just the same with men. I vow
4565,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,I saw an astral stuff poured in
4566,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Pockets of air and men became
4567,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Voices talking of good and evil,"
4568,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Virtue, courage, vice and sin,"
4569,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,God and the devil.
4570,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4571,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,For the all unfolding Air is what?
4572,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"The Great Idea, if so I may say,"
4573,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,A sort of Ocean leaping to waves.
4574,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And what do you care if they pass away?
4575,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"They sink to their source, not into graves."
4576,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Beasts may vanish, races decay,"
4577,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,The Ocean will always remain the same;
4578,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"With new waves rising, no two alike;"
4579,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,Waves that are little and waves that rise
4580,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,In storms and touch the skies.
4581,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4582,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"R. Browning, you were a man of power,"
4583,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,But I don't think much of your tower.
4584,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"And I see no use of blowing a horn,"
4585,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"The tower is merely papier-maché,"
4586,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And comes no higher than to my knees.
4587,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"I step right over it--pick a flower,"
4588,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"Purple, it may be, called heart's ease"
4589,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,And go with the way of the seas.
4590,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,
4591,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,For I am an optimist better than you:
4592,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"This dream is hell, but it's all to the good:"
4593,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,The Ocean is water in calm or flood.
4594,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,"There's nothing wrecked, or wrongly wrought,"
4595,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,There's nothing real but Thought!
4596,NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN,

4600,THE OAK TREE,THE OAK TREE
4601,THE OAK TREE,
4602,THE OAK TREE,
4603,THE OAK TREE,"The oak in later August,"
4604,THE OAK TREE,"Before his leaves are strewn,"
4605,THE OAK TREE,"And the sky is blue as June,"
4606,THE OAK TREE,Trembles from trunk to branches
4607,THE OAK TREE,For frosts that will be soon
4608,THE OAK TREE,From the valleys of the moon!
4609,THE OAK TREE,
4610,THE OAK TREE,For breezes blown in August
4611,THE OAK TREE,Veer north with cold and rain;
4612,THE OAK TREE,And the oak tree sighs and shivers
4613,THE OAK TREE,For lights that shift and wane:
4614,THE OAK TREE,As a strong man sees the specters
4615,THE OAK TREE,"Of age, disease and pain,"
4616,THE OAK TREE,The oak flings up to heaven
4617,THE OAK TREE,His branches in the rain.
4618,THE OAK TREE,
4619,THE OAK TREE,"September comes, September"
4620,THE OAK TREE,Spreads out a sky that chills.
4621,THE OAK TREE,The owl hoots and the cricket
4622,THE OAK TREE,"Beside the roadway shrills,"
4623,THE OAK TREE,And on the stricken hills.
4624,THE OAK TREE,"But the oak tree, the oak tree"
4625,THE OAK TREE,Still flaunts his shining leaves.
4626,THE OAK TREE,No change has come but swallows
4627,THE OAK TREE,Who fled the summer eaves!
4628,THE OAK TREE,
4629,THE OAK TREE,"But when October breezes,"
4630,THE OAK TREE,And cold November gales
4631,THE OAK TREE,Descend upon the oak tree
4632,THE OAK TREE,"What strength of him avails,"
4633,THE OAK TREE,"Grown naked to the tempest,"
4634,THE OAK TREE,For life that sleeps and fails?
4635,THE OAK TREE,"O oak tree, oak tree,"
4636,THE OAK TREE,The winter snow prevails!
4637,THE OAK TREE,"It cannot be your branches,"
4638,THE OAK TREE,It is the wind that wails!

4647,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Among the mountain ferns
4648,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,On a ledge of rock on high.
4649,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Below the yawning chasm turns
4650,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"To blackness, but the evening planet burns"

4654,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Fly to their rookeries
4655,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,In the rocks
4656,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,With swift and ragged wings against the lights.
4657,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,From levels and from leas
4658,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Haste the returning flocks.
4659,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Foxes have holes and serpents the grass for flight.
4660,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Eagle, arise! It is night."
4661,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
4662,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,The world's wanderer finds you
4663,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,As he climbs the mountains
4664,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,In the unending quest.
4665,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Can you spread wings across the darkening chasm
4666,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"To the craggy nest,"
4667,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Where the foreboding mate lies still?
4668,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Croak for the evening star,"
4669,THE HOUSE ON THE HILL,And beat your shattered wings against your breast!

4678,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4679,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"That's right, sponge off his face. My name? Oh, yes,"
4680,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"James Frothingham, a reverend, have the church"
4681,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"At the corner of Ayer and Knox Streets, Methodist."
4682,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,As I was passing by a vile saloon
4683,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Some men were entering the back room, saying"
4684,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Is he dead or drunk, and such things. I looked in,"
4685,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Went in at last and saw this fellow there,"
4686,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Hunched, doubled down into a chair asleep,"
4687,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Mud on his face as you saw, clothes bespattered,"
4688,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,The smell of drink upon him. Then we took him
4689,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And brought him here, I helped, a Christian duty."
4690,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"But more important, if he wakes I'm here"
4691,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,To bring his soul to Christ before he dies--
4692,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And he is dying. Yes, it's plain enough"
4693,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The snows of death are falling. Sponge his face,"
4694,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And wash his hands! I never saw such hands
4695,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Slender and beautiful! Now you have sponged
4696,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"His face, look at that brow--it terrifies--"
4697,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,He looks now like a god--who is this man?
4698,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,I'll tell you all I know: These men were talking
4699,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And this is what they said: This is the fellow
4700,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"They voted yesterday from booth to booth,"
4701,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"They voted him twenty times, and kept him drunk"
4702,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To vote him. First they found him at the station,"
4703,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"A little tipsy, talking of his griefs."
4704,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The conductor put him off here, being drunk."
4705,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And so these fellows for election day
4706,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Took him in hand and voted him around,"
4707,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,This was the talk.
4708,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4709,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Look at the curse of drink!
4710,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"If he had touched no drink, he had not been"
4711,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Tipsy to fall into these ruffian hands,"
4712,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Who gave him drink and drink and used him thus
4713,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To violate the suffrage, lose his life"
4714,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Through drink, as he will lose it. He is dying,"
4715,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Death comes of Sin--what plainer truth than this?
4716,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Sin blinds, too, for that brow could comprehend"
4717,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,All things by using what God gave to it.
4718,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I do not know his name, with your permission"
4719,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I'll search his pockets--yes, here is a letter--"
4720,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"No signature, looks like a draught--I'll read:"
4721,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4722,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"""Why have you wounded me with words like these:"
4723,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"'He has great genius but no moral sense,'"
4724,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And written to another! Oh my love!
4725,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"By this love which I bear you, by the God"
4726,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Who reigns in heaven do I swear to you
4727,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"My soul is like a wandering star, consumed"
4728,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"By its own passion, fire, and the eternal"
4729,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Longing for the eternal, wandering, erring,"
4730,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"But flaming, loving light, aspiring to"
4731,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The Light of Lights, some sun, I do not know."
4732,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,It is incapable of aught but honor.
4733,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And save for follies, trifles in excess,"
4734,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Which I lament, but which in men of wealth,"
4735,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Or worldly power would never raise a word,"
4736,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,I can recall no act of mine to bring
4737,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,A blush to your cheek or to mine.
4738,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4739,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"My love,"
4740,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"My erring which has counted, by the test"
4741,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Of strength or weakness for the game of life,"
4742,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Has been Quixotic honor, chivalry."
4743,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And to indulge this feeling I have paid,"
4744,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Though it has been my true voluptuousness,"
4745,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"My highest, purest pleasure. Yes, for this"
4746,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I threw away a fortune, glad to throw it,"
4747,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Rather than suffer wrong, though trivial,"
4748,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,As worldly men would count it:--for a father's
4749,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Laughter at my writing turned away
4750,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To follow voices, and defied his will"
4751,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,To harness me to business. So it is
4752,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To keep my spirit spotless from the world,"
4753,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"As I have visioned things, I came at last"
4754,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"By this deserted shore, alone, alone,"
4755,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Now quite alone since you withdrew yourself,"
4756,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Took back your hand and left me to my way,"
4757,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Traveled so long that I can see the tomb
4758,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,At the vista's end not very far.
4759,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4760,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Oh, love,"
4761,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Why is there not a heart that loves but mine?
4762,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"If you had been a Magdalen, I had pressed"
4763,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Your head against my breast and kept you there--
4764,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,But you--my spirit drifts with stricken wings--
4765,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"But you because of gossip, crawling words"
4766,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"About my drinking, lies as I shall prove,"
4767,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Can hold a handkerchief upon your eyes
4768,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To hide tumultuous tears, extend your hand"
4769,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And say farewell forever, cut our lives"
4770,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Of days or months, fragile and trivial"
4771,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Asunder--when your hand, your faith, your love"
4772,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Had cured me of my spirit's desolation,"
4773,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,My terror of this solitude in life--
4774,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Or if it cured me not, I had been eased,"
4775,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And you had gained for giving--what have you
4776,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"For your decision? Sorrow, if you love me,"
4777,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Perhaps a conscience whisper that you failed
4778,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"In justice, sacrifice; perhaps the thought"
4779,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Life with me drinking, to the excess you thought,"
4780,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Is better than a life where I am not.
4781,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,What have you gained? In a few years we two
4782,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Will be at one with earth--before it comes
4783,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Are not sweet hours together worth the cost
4784,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Of a little drink? You who have riches, need not"
4785,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"My labors for your bread, but need my love,"
4786,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Which you crush out. But as to drink, I swear"
4787,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I do not drink."""
4788,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4789,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Ahem! the fellow stirs
4790,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"But will not wake, I fear. You heard that last:"
4791,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,He swears he does not drink. Drink and untruth
4792,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Go always hand in hand. This letter's long--
4793,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Let's see what he comes up with at the last:
4794,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4795,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"""But as to drink, I swear I do not drink--"
4796,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,How if I drank could I produce the works
4797,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I have produced? A giant's task, when drink"
4798,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Sustains me not, is not my nutriment"
4799,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"As hock and soda water were for Byron,"
4800,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"But sets me flaming wild, a little drink"
4801,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Will set me flaming, poisons me, I know."
4802,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And yet I must partake of drink sometimes
4803,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"For life is flying, is recession, we"
4804,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Are shrinking back into ourselves, at last"
4805,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,The arms we shrank from close about us--death's.
4806,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And there are souls born lonely; I am one.
4807,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And gifted with the glance of looking through
4808,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The shams, the opera bouffe, and I am one."
4809,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Often after a stretch of toil when I
4810,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Come out of the trance of writing spent and wracked,"
4811,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I used to walk to High Bridge, sit and muse,"
4812,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"(For this brain never stops and that's my curse,)"
4813,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Upon this monstrous world and why it is;
4814,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And why the souls who love the beautiful,"
4815,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,And love it only and are doomed to speak
4816,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Its wonder and its terror are alone,"
4817,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Misunderstood and hunted, fouled by falsehood,"
4818,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Have crumbs upon the steps, are licked by dogs,"
4819,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Or else are starved. And why it is that I
4820,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Must go about, a beggar, with my songs"
4821,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Exchanging them for bread. And then it is
4822,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"When this poor brain like the creative stuff,"
4823,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The central purpose, whirls, as I have written,"
4824,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And will not stop--drink! for oblivion,"
4825,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"For rest, to get away from self, back faster"
4826,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,From the pursuing Nothing.
4827,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4828,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Yet, my love,"
4829,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Think out what causes judgments, standards, tastes;"
4830,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And why it was that Southey, Wordsworth won"
4831,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"The organic national praise and Shelley lost,"
4832,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And Byron lost it--Southey the sycophant,"
4833,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Wordsworth the dull adherent, renegade--"
4834,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,These two against these spirits who came here
4835,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To sing of Liberty--and look at me,"
4836,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"A wanderer and a poor, rejected man,"
4837,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"While usurers, slave owners rule the land,"
4838,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"And the cities reek with hypocrites, who step"
4839,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"On Freedom and on Beauty, are rewarded,"
4840,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Praised, fed and honored for it. Then behold"
4841,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Your friend who loves you, hunted, buffeted,"
4842,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"For a little drink, when in spite of drink and even"
4843,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Because of drink, who knows? I have achieved,"
4844,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Written these books. And what is life beside,"
4845,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Whether with drink or whether with abstinence,"
4846,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Except to sing your song and die, what course"
4847,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Can stave the event, the wage of life, not sin?"
4848,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Oh if you knew what love I have for you!
4849,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,All of my powers are not enough to tell
4850,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"How all my heart is yours, how I have found"
4851,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Eternal things through you, cannot surrender"
4852,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Your love, your heart, without I lose some life,"
4853,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Some vital part of me--and yet farewell,"
4854,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"For you have willed it so, and I submit."
4855,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"I rise up in my loneliness, seek the sun"
4856,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"To shine about me in my loneliness,"
4857,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Submit and say farewell."""
4858,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,
4859,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,He spoke some words!
4860,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,What was it that he said? His head rolls over.
4861,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,The man is dead! What was it that he said?
4862,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Something about ""no more"" it seemed to me."
4863,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Whom shall we notify? Go tell the police!
4864,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"Here! wait, I overlooked some writing--yes,"
4865,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"A name is on this letter--why, look here,"
4866,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,It's EDGAR ALLAN POE!--I know that name--
4867,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,He wrote a poem once about sleigh bells--
4868,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,"His brow looks whiter, bigger than it did."
4869,WASHINGTON HOSPITAL,Cover him with a sheet--I'll tell the police!
