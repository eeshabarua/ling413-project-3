382,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,Hark to a story of Christmas Eve

384,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"'Tis of the measureless, savage woods"
385,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,By the great lake's windy shore--
386,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"Of mother and child, in a firelit span,"
387,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,Where the wilderness bows to the toil of man!
388,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,
389,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""Christmas is coming, and father'll be here;"
390,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"Through the woods he is coming, I know!"

395,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,
396,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""Mother, what are those restless flames"
397,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"That close by the window pass?"""
398,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""Only the firelight fairies, child,"
399,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,That dance on the window-glass!
400,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"But look, how the sparks up the chimney fly,"
401,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"Up, and away, to the snowy sky!"""
402,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,
403,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""Oh, listen, what are those shuddering cries,--"
404,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"Mother, what can they be?"""
405,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""Only the branches that grate on the roof,"

408,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"That I, myself, as a little child knew!"""
409,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,
410,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""But, mother, those flames dart back and forth--"
411,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,Like balls of fire they play!

414,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"""My child! Your father's whistle I hear--"

416,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,
417,HOLLY AND MISTLETOE,"She has seized the tongs, she has snatched a brand,"

526,MEETING THE KINGS,"Three children, ruddy with the _midi_ sun"
527,MEETING THE KINGS,"(And blither none the all-seeing sun might see),"
528,MEETING THE KINGS,"How happy when the harvest-time was done,"
529,MEETING THE KINGS,The last slow drop from out the winepress run;
530,MEETING THE KINGS,And when the frost at morn was thick like snow;
531,MEETING THE KINGS,"And when Clotilde at evening sang and spun,"
532,MEETING THE KINGS,"And old folk, by the new fire's ruddy glow,"
533,MEETING THE KINGS,"Would tell, as I do now, the tales of long ago!"
534,MEETING THE KINGS,
535,MEETING THE KINGS,"Those tales--ah, most of all, we begged to hear"
536,MEETING THE KINGS,The tales our grandsires from their grandsires had--

542,MEETING THE KINGS,"The white ox knelt within his littered stall,"
543,MEETING THE KINGS,And voices strange and sweet were heard through heaven to call!

545,MEETING THE KINGS,"We were three children--René, Pierre, Annette."
546,MEETING THE KINGS,"The little sister listened, wonder-eyed;"
547,MEETING THE KINGS,"Each held her hand (that touch, I feel it yet!),"
548,MEETING THE KINGS,And all three drank those tales of Christmas tide.
549,MEETING THE KINGS,The leaden-footed time how shall we bide?
550,MEETING THE KINGS,"How many days and hours we know full well,"
551,MEETING THE KINGS,Almost the little minutes that divide!

562,MEETING THE KINGS,"Perhaps upon white steeds, curbed-in, and tall,"

565,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Will they at vespers be, on Holy Night?"

569,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Hush, René, hush! and if the eve be fine,"

589,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Annette the first shall see the Kings, no doubt""--"
590,MEETING THE KINGS,It was our grandsire spake with twinkling eye.
591,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Yes, yes; she shall,"" impatient to be out,"
592,MEETING THE KINGS,"We answered. Once beneath the deepening sky,"
593,MEETING THE KINGS,We ever took the sunset way--as late birds thither fly!
594,MEETING THE KINGS,
595,MEETING THE KINGS,For thus we reasoned with one grave consent:
596,MEETING THE KINGS,If yonder star above our mountain's crest
597,MEETING THE KINGS,"Should be that Eastern star for guidance lent,"
598,MEETING THE KINGS,Then must the Kings be journeying from the West.
599,MEETING THE KINGS,"So on we ran, past harvest fields at rest,"
600,MEETING THE KINGS,Past sheepfolds where the flock of summer dreamed
601,MEETING THE KINGS,"(Full soon they would be kneeling, as we guessed!)"
602,MEETING THE KINGS,"And on, and on--and now, at times, it seemed"
603,MEETING THE KINGS,Far down the twilight road rich banners waved and gleamed.
604,MEETING THE KINGS,
605,MEETING THE KINGS,"But ever of enchanted weft they proved,"
606,MEETING THE KINGS,On sunset's pageant field emblazoned low;
607,MEETING THE KINGS,"And caravans, still moving as we moved,"
608,MEETING THE KINGS,"At length, for straggling olive trees would show."
609,MEETING THE KINGS,"Then, while less confident our pace would grow,"
610,MEETING THE KINGS,"Wiser than I--a twelvemonth and a day,"
611,MEETING THE KINGS,Would René counsel: Might it not be so--
612,MEETING THE KINGS,As we had heard our own dear mother say--
613,MEETING THE KINGS,_The roads are four_--the Kings had come another way?
614,MEETING THE KINGS,
615,MEETING THE KINGS,"No time to lose. We took the homeward track,"
616,MEETING THE KINGS,The Kings at vespers might be lingering still.
617,MEETING THE KINGS,"Soon were we in the church. Alack, alack!"
618,MEETING THE KINGS,The Kings had passed; for though they bore good will
619,MEETING THE KINGS,"To our good parish, yet must they fulfil"
620,MEETING THE KINGS,The prayers of all; and there were other folk
621,MEETING THE KINGS,"Who, if unvisited, would take it ill."
622,MEETING THE KINGS,"""'Tis said they must reach Arle by midnight stroke;"
623,MEETING THE KINGS,"Sweet spices they have left--judge by the censer's smoke!"""
624,MEETING THE KINGS,
625,MEETING THE KINGS,We boys took manfully this frown of Fate;
626,MEETING THE KINGS,But tears stood in petite Annette's blue eyes.
627,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Another year, my precious,--thou canst wait;"
628,MEETING THE KINGS,"Besides, to-morrow morn a fine surprise"
629,MEETING THE KINGS,There'll be for children who are sage and wise.
630,MEETING THE KINGS,"Gifts--but I may not tell you now, my child.""--"
631,MEETING THE KINGS,'Twas mother-love that did such cure devise
632,MEETING THE KINGS,For bud-nipped hopes and hearts unreconciled;

635,MEETING THE KINGS,"Time passed. We never saw the Kings. Ah, well--"
636,MEETING THE KINGS,"At least the two of us saw not, I know."
637,MEETING THE KINGS,But how shall I the wonder of it tell?
638,MEETING THE KINGS,There came a winter wild and dim with snow.
639,MEETING THE KINGS,It seemed to us that sheeted ghosts did go
640,MEETING THE KINGS,"Upon the wind, that never ceased to moan."
641,MEETING THE KINGS,And one of us with fever was laid low:
642,MEETING THE KINGS,"Like leaves the little hands were tossed and thrown,"
643,MEETING THE KINGS,And on her cheek the rose of fever was o'erblown!

648,MEETING THE KINGS,"One crimson flame, a parting sunbeam shot."
649,MEETING THE KINGS,"It reached Annette upon the low, white cot,"
650,MEETING THE KINGS,"It touched our mother's face, Madonna-mild."
651,MEETING THE KINGS,"With dreaming eyes that saw us, yet saw not,"
652,MEETING THE KINGS,Petite Annette threw out her hand and smiled:
653,MEETING THE KINGS,"""Pierre! The Kings have come, and with them is a Child!"""
654,MEETING THE KINGS,
655,MEETING THE KINGS,"Long, long ago in dear Provence was grief."

658,MEETING THE KINGS,"In vain I heard, ""God loved Annette so well"
659,MEETING THE KINGS,"That He hath taken her to heaven to dwell."""
660,MEETING THE KINGS,No comfort till René would whisper me:

938,BABUSHKA,No thought of fear has she;
939,BABUSHKA,The wind-blown candle in her hand
940,BABUSHKA,Shines out on strangers three.
941,BABUSHKA,
942,BABUSHKA,"Their beards are white with age, and snow"

980,BABUSHKA,But none the way could show.
981,BABUSHKA,"""It must be farther yet,"" she sighed;"

3127,THE SAVING OF JACK,In the whole of this block there isn't a tot
3128,THE SAVING OF JACK,"But has had Jack home to board and to sleep,"
3129,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And he pays 'em in fun, every cent of his keep."
3130,THE SAVING OF JACK,"He's the best-natured dog, and the smartest, too;"
3131,THE SAVING OF JACK,No end of the tricks we've taught him to do.
3132,THE SAVING OF JACK,Got a heap of sense in his yellow hide!
3133,THE SAVING OF JACK,He's the wonderf'lest dog on the whole East Side;
3134,THE SAVING OF JACK,"Why, even the dog-man doesn't know"
3135,THE SAVING OF JACK,"What breed Jack is,--for he told me so!"
3136,THE SAVING OF JACK,"The dog-catchers came a'most every day,"
3137,THE SAVING OF JACK,"But Jack knew their cart, and he'd hide away;"
3138,THE SAVING OF JACK,"Then out he'd come, laughing, when they'd got past."
3139,THE SAVING OF JACK,Can't _guess_ how he ever was cotched at last;
3140,THE SAVING OF JACK,"But he was, and they boosted him into their cart,"
3141,THE SAVING OF JACK,And nobody there could take his part.
3142,THE SAVING OF JACK,"My! but the little kids cried like mad,"
3143,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And us bigger ones, too,--we felt just as bad;"
3144,THE SAVING OF JACK,For he'd rode us all on his old yellow back.
3145,THE SAVING OF JACK,"It looked as though it was all up with Jack,"
3146,THE SAVING OF JACK,And I watched him go; but he cocked one eye
3147,THE SAVING OF JACK,"As much as to say, ""I'll be back by and by."""
3148,THE SAVING OF JACK,The look that he gave me--it made me _think_;
3149,THE SAVING OF JACK,And I thought of a plan as quick as wink

3151,THE SAVING OF JACK,"I guess that we've each of us got a few cents,"
3152,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And we'll club together and have a show,"
3153,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And charge a price, not high nor low;"
3154,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And we'll raise the money, right here and now,"
3155,THE SAVING OF JACK,That'll buy Jack back by to-morrow--that's how!
3156,THE SAVING OF JACK,"Tony, the Eyetalian boy, he'll sing;"
3157,THE SAVING OF JACK,And Patsy McGovern'll do his handspring;
3158,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And Ikey Aarons'll swallow his knife,"
3159,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And make us all think he's taking his life,"
3160,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And little Freda, she'll pass round the hat,"

3163,THE SAVING OF JACK,Every one of us big 'uns and each little kid
3164,THE SAVING OF JACK,Ran home for their banks as fast as they could;
3165,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And we raised the money, and all felt good;"
3166,THE SAVING OF JACK,"And next day, early, we brought Jack back."
3167,THE SAVING OF JACK,"So, now, things run in the same old track,"
