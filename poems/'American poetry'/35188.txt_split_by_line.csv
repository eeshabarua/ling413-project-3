220,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Spying in the gold hunting grounds of the sun.
221,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
222,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Many the gaily dressed young Braves

224,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And made soft eyes and sang wooing songs,"

241,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
242,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like the young trees of the sea shore
243,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He was slim and straight.
244,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like the water rolling up the white sands
245,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He was ever tireless.
246,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like the shining of the spirit sun
247,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He lighted all the day with gold magic;
248,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like the kindly silver moon
249,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He peopled all the night with friendly shadows.
250,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The heart of every maiden was wingéd
251,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"In the wild breast of her,"
252,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,If he but looked where her footsteps led her.

260,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
261,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"In the cool night of the fat, bloody moon of harvest"
262,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the tribal storehouses were full heaped
263,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With dried fish and bear, buffalo and deer meat,"
264,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With little mountains of maize for winter;
265,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the cakes and candles of yellow tallow
266,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Were moulded past numbering,"
267,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the wide-mouthed seed baskets
268,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Were high heaped with richness,"
269,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And many deep nut baskets were overflowing,"
270,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the dried berries from far thickets
271,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Made little sun painted hills--
272,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then all of the tribe of our hunting grounds
273,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Bathed their hard worked bodies,"
274,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Oiled their smooth skins, painted their happy faces"
275,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And put on the wealth of their richest robes
276,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For the Great Dance of Thanksgiving.
277,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
278,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When the robins made love chase that season,"
279,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In the secret ceremonial of the wise old women
280,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,My Maiden's Hour had been celebrated.
281,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
282,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Always had my proud, savage Mother"
283,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Taken me alone to the forest,"
284,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And there, beating hands and chanting,"
285,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She had carefully taught me
286,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The Wonder Dance of the Maidens' Hour
287,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of the Mandanas, her people."
288,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
289,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"It was a dance of moonlight and moon madness,"
290,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of sign love talk, of eyes asking great gifts,"
291,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of swift feet stamping like the roebuck
292,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And singing bead and shell trinket music,"
293,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So that all the night was softly lighted
294,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With strange visions flower sweet.
295,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
296,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,On the day of the Thanksgiving Ceremonial
297,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When my Mother oiled me to leaf fine smoothness,"
298,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And hung me heavy with bracelets of bone beads
299,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And a necklace of precious carved blue shell,"
300,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As her skilled hands of love flew,"
301,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In my ear she made Canawac talk:
302,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
303,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""To-night, before the Great Sachem"
304,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"On his high throne of prideful authority,"
305,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With the son who follows him in Council,"
306,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Sitting beside his knee,"
307,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When thou leadest the Thanksgiving Dance
308,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,At the head of the young women
309,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Thou shalt wave all of them back to their places,"
310,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And alone, before the assembled Chieftains,"
311,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Thou shalt dance the Mating Dance
312,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of the rich and powerful Mandanas,"
313,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Ever keeping thine eye of glad submission,"
314,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Fast on the eye of Mountain Lion.
315,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
316,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""If the soft light in his eye strike fire for thee,"
317,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then shalt thou forget all others
318,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And dance out thy heart for him alone
319,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And bow low as the young cedar before him,"
320,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And as the serpent charm him.
321,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,If he arise and stand facing thee
322,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And dance love manifest before thee,"
323,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then is the hour come for thy union with him.
324,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
325,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Then shall I fly to set up thy wigwam"
326,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of down-fine doeskin, bleached with love,"
327,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"That many suns I have worked on in hiding for thee,"
328,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And gladly in the sand before it
329,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Thou shalt set thy lighted candle,"
330,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Thy tall proud candle of gold bear tallow;
331,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And if he come to thee with soft words
332,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With words of wooing magic,"
333,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then shalt thou bury thy candle flame
334,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In the yielding sands before him.
335,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
336,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Then art thou our Chieftainess in seasons to come,"
337,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And high shall thy sure heart beat
338,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With pride of love and power,"
339,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And swift shall thy red blood run in leaping streams
340,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With the flood-high tide of mighty Chieftains.
341,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
342,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Braves shall thy many straight sons be,"
343,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Great Chiefs who shall rule other far nations;
344,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And sweet shall thy tall strong women be
345,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As the red honey-flower that grows in the forest,"
346,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And swift shall their hearts be
347,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,As the heart of the frightened fawn
348,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"That leaps with feathered feet before the hunter."""
349,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
350,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Medicine Man, make me a sure medicine,"
351,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"A strong medicine, new to our people,"
352,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That shall ease my weary eyes
353,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of a red bird and a white lily.
354,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
355,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the Harvest Ceremonial Dance
356,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Was cried through all the village,"
357,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When night crept, silent as the bat's wing,"
358,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From the blanketed heart of the forest,"
359,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the great Assembly Lodge
360,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Was lighted and filled with happy faces,"
361,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the old chiefs and the wise men
362,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Had spoken thanksgivings for fat harvest,"
363,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And the time was come for all the tribe to rejoice,"
364,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,First came the dance of the little stumbling children;
365,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"The little fat bellied round faced serious children,"
366,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With shining black hair and wonder eyes,"
367,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And flower red cheeks and mouths,"
368,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And stout breath like short gusts of North Wind.
369,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
370,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When, worn out with swift dances,"
371,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"They rolled in their soft blankets,"
372,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Came the shy youths' dance,"
373,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And the uncertain growing maidens'
374,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,All bravely tinkling little necklaces
375,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of squirrel and rabbit teeth, and bright rare shells."
376,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
377,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Then danced the carefully trained young women,"
378,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Grown and ripe for the Harvest of love.
379,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In their lead I did as my Mother had told me.
380,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
381,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Straight I stood before the Great Sachem
382,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And the son of the pride of his heart.
383,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"High I lifted my head like a proud pine tree,"
384,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And softly I shook my bracelets of beads
385,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And rattled my necklace of blue shell,"
386,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And rustled the porcupine fringes
387,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of my fine robe of yellow,"
388,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In music like the little secret whispering
389,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Among the dry grass under passing feet.
390,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
391,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I spoke as I had always been taught by my Mother:
392,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Great Chief, grant that I dance before thee"
393,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"The Woman's Love Dance of the brave Mandanas,"
394,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,A dance that I have learned
395,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From the swift feet of my Mother."""
396,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
397,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Searchingly, the Great Sachem looked at his son"
398,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And his son looked at me with understanding
399,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And made a swift sign to his Father;
400,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"So raising his hands of authority,"
401,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The Great Sachem cried aloud:
402,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Yiada, daughter of Chief White Wolf,"
403,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Will dance the Woman's Dance of the Mandanas,"
404,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Let all others be seated. I have said it!"""
405,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
406,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Alone, with the blood of heart red on lip and cheek"
407,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And with the pride of my asking heart
408,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Beating like wings on my light feet,"
409,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With my Mother keeping time for me,"
410,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As she did in the secret forest,"
411,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Slowly I stepped into the great dance
412,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of the Mandanas, of the peace lands;"
413,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The strongest love medicine
414,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Ever measured by the feet of wild women.
415,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
416,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As I danced, even as my Mother had long told me"
417,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I kept my eyes ever spying
418,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Deep into the eyes of Mountain Lion.
419,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When the dance grew to its swiftest wildest note,"
420,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When my proud head of certainty
421,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And my willing arms were high lifted,"
422,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And the beads and obsidian and blue shell
423,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Tinkled soft singing, like falling rain,"
424,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Mountain Lion sprang to his feet
425,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And came down in the firelight before me.
426,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
427,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With no knowledge of the dance of the Mandanas,"
428,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And no teaching of step or of posture,"
429,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He fell into the strange measures
430,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That my Mother had taught me;
431,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With eyes upon eyes and heart near to heart,"
432,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Facing in the wide fire flaming circle
433,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Where envious faces kept watch upon us,"
434,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,We danced the wonder dance
435,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of the hour of full womanhood.
436,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
437,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
438,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Healer of the hearts of the Mandanas,"
439,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"There, facing the chiefs and maidens"
440,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of a thousand lodges of our tribe,"
441,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With the Great Sachem keenly watching
442,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"On his high throne of great power,"
443,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Darest say that was not my hour
444,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,My rightful moon of exultation?
445,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
446,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When I looked, near the close of the dance,"
447,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Toward my Mother for guidance
448,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She gave me the swift happy sign of birds flying;
449,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So I caught that joyful sign
450,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And I gave it to the waiting maidens.
451,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like homing swallows they swept around me;
452,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"The young Braves came stamping,"
453,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Like roebucks before the does of Spring,"
454,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then all of us changed the dance
455,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,To the love measures of the Canawacs.
456,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
457,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the chattering maidens
458,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Went back to their waiting mothers,"
459,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I stood there tall and straight and proud
460,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Fresh as the wing of the eagle,"
461,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the highest peak of dawn
462,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Eye to eye, face to face with Mountain Lion."
463,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,His eyes burned deep into my eyes
464,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With a look of quivering power.
465,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Medicine Man, darest thou say"
466,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That was not the great understanding?
467,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
468,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So when all of the others
469,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Went on with the Dance of Thanksgiving,"
470,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Soft as the veiling mists
471,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the dim breast of evening meadows
472,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I slipped from the Council House
473,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And I flew to our lodge.
474,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
475,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With hands of high satisfaction
476,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,My Mother set my wigwam beside her lodge.
477,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I lighted my tall happy candle of bear fat;
478,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I opened my doorway wide to the friendly moon;
479,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Deep in the sands I set my love light to burning.
480,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And there I waited--long and long I waited,"
481,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In burning eagerness of heart
482,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Tremblingly listening with each breath
483,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For the sure step of Mountain Lion.
484,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
485,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Then, Medicine Man,"
486,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With black angered sign talk
487,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And fierce eyes of leaping fire,"
488,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Came my storm driven Mother.
489,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As she came toward me,"
490,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Like a killing wind uprooting the cedars,"
491,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Arose high clamour from the Council Lodge.
492,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
493,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"She caught up my hopeful waiting candle,"
494,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"My living love token to Mountain Lion, my man,"
495,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"She buried its flame deep in the white sands,"
496,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"In rage she thrust it from her,"
497,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She snatched shut the welcoming doors
498,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Before the eyes of anguish of my Mother
499,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of my willing doeskin wigwam,"
500,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And in the harsh low voiced Canawac tongue
501,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She cried to me in choking anger:
502,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
503,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""Woe is upon us! Strangers have reached us."
504,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Comes a great Chief from tribes of the far North,"
505,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From the camps of the powerful Killimacs,"
506,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the home fires of the Ice God;
507,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And with him on a snow white pony
508,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Rides his beautiful raven haired daughter,"
509,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,A tall proud Princess of a great warlike nation.
510,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
511,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""This night Mountain Lion will not come to thee:"
512,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,His father has sent him to serve the rich strangers.
513,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Get thee back to thy place in the Council Lodge
514,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Before the venom tipped finger pointers miss thee,"
515,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"For there will be great feasting and much talk,"
516,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The rejoicing will last for many suns and moons.
517,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,It was the wrong time for thy dance of allurement
518,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Thy maiden proffer of prideful loving,"
519,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"But I, thy Mother, taught thee thy undoing,"
520,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"I, thy Mother, gave to thee the sign."""
521,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
522,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Then, Medicine Man,"
523,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As fierce a storm as ever tore the forest,"
524,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As ever pitched the sea high in wild fury,"
525,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Broke in my heart, leaping to flee its lodging place."
526,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"I lifted my head high, and proudly and silently"
527,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"I stepped into the moon tide,"
528,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"But I trembled and shook with all-over sickness,"
529,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"My blood ran hot angry gushes,"
530,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And I, who had never known pain"
531,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"In any part of my strong body,"
532,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Now felt its rending arrows
533,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Tearing my heart in sick torture,"
534,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,As I crept through the restless whispering forest
535,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Where the wise old yellow leaves
536,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Talked over my shame with each other
537,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And every mocking finger of night
538,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Pointed in derision at my wounded side.
539,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
540,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I crept back to the Council Lodge
541,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Still as a panther fending for her cubs,"
542,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"I slipped in unseen by any,"
543,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And took up my place among the young women.
544,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,On the high throne of power
545,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Beside our Great Sachem, Storm Wind,"
546,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Sat a tall Chief trailing rich robes
547,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of white fox, sealskin, and white bear."
548,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"A proud Chief of savage face,"
549,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Weighted with a heavy necklace of eagles' claws,"
550,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Many elk teeth, and lion talons,"
551,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Hanging across his broad shoulders.
552,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
553,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Standing still and straight before them,"
554,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"First, I saw the stranger woman."
555,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"I heard the deep voice of her father,"
556,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Toned to soft talk, as among peace councils,"
557,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When he told the Great Sachem and Chieftains
558,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And all the watching Canawacs:
559,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
560,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"""This is my daughter, a Princess of seven tribes,"
561,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"She who can run with the foot of the hare,"
562,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Who can dance as the gold birch leaves,"
563,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When spring comes stealing from the Southland;
564,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Who can guide the swift canoes surely
565,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And ride the wild ponies on the chase,"
566,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Whose fingers are skilful in basket weaving,"
567,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"In beading, and braiding, and polishing ornaments."
568,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She comes with me to make the friendship
569,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of a people of her mother's blood;
570,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And her name is a name held sacred
571,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Among all the tribes at peace with us.
572,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like music there fell from his smooth tongue
573,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"A name well known to council wise Canawacs,"
574,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,'Coüy-oüy'--a breath of sweetness--
575,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,He spoke it like the easy tongue of a lazy brook
576,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Softly singing among the small stones of its bed.
577,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
578,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then every Canawac remembered the dark days
579,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When the Great Spirit became justly angered,"
580,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And in the height of his deep wrath
581,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Against the treachery of all tribes
582,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Drew up the waters of destruction
583,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Until they covered the earth's face,"
584,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Leaving upon the tallest tree
585,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Only one Chief and his mate,"
586,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And one pair of every bird and climbing beast,"
587,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,On the top of the highest mountain
588,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of all the earth known to man.
589,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
590,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,When the water had come up to the top branches
591,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Until only their heads were above it,"
592,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And had stood still for three weary suns,"
593,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Then slowly it drew back, and left the earth barren,"
594,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So there was no fire to cook food
595,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"For the hungry Sachem and his mate,"
596,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Nor to warm the water soaked camping grounds.
597,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
598,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then the Sachem sent a beaver messenger
599,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Far down to the underworld
600,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,To borrow only one coal
601,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the campfires of the dark spirits;
602,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,But the beaver was not able to bring it
603,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For burning his mouth cruelly.
604,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
605,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Then he sent the fierce mountain lion,"
606,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Searching all over the earth for campfires,"
607,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"But there was no fire to be found,"
608,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For the water had been everywhere.
609,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
610,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then he sent a little gray bird to the spirit world
611,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,To bring from the campfires of the unseen country
612,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,One living coal with which to make a fire
613,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"For the cooking kettles and light-signals,"
614,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And to warm the lodges of all the tribes
615,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That would follow him in suns to come.
616,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
617,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So the dauntless little gray bird
618,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Slowly winged across the far spaces.
619,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Three suns arose and set, and at the red evening"
620,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When the third sun plunged its face in the sea,"
621,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With all of its plumage burned a flame-tongue red,"
622,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With a beak of red like hot coals
623,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And its face blackened with fire,"
624,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Came the brave panting bird
625,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"With a living coal held fast in its mouth,"
626,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,A coal snatched from the high altars
627,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of the far country of the spirits.
628,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
629,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And so the fire gift was brought back to earth
630,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,To warm the hearts and the wigwams
631,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of every nation, for all seasons to come."
632,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
633,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The bird was sent from a stranger tribe
634,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Far to the south of our hunting grounds,"
635,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Where the hot suns shine and the grass withers;
636,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"But travellers journeying northward to see us,"
637,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Had told our grandfathers about it,"
638,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Had shown us the bird of bloody red beak
639,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And face still blackened with fire,"
640,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Singing gaily in our summer forests,"
641,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Singing even in the ice of winter.
642,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
643,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Often when we chanted songs of thanksgiving
644,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"To the Great Spirit, for rich gifts,"
645,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When we thanked him for the buffalo and beaver,"
646,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"For the deer meat and fish and corn for winter,"
647,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Then our tribes made a ceremonial of glad rejoicing
648,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For the bird that brought back
649,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,The great wonder gift of fire.
650,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
651,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Its sacred name fell on our ears
652,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Like the peace of the Great Spirit,"
653,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Fell soft as flying snowflakes
654,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When first squaw winter comes,"
655,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Soft as the hunting wing of the thieving owl,"
656,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Sweet as the breath of flowers in the nesting moon,"
657,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From the lips of the Great Chief: ""Coüy-oüy."""
658,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
659,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Before him, her shining head bowed,"
660,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Our people watched her in silent wonder.
661,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"She was tall, taller than any of our women,"
662,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Tall and slender like the singing wind reeds
663,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That grow around the magic pool
664,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Of the white spirit lily of the still water,"
665,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Far back in the valley pastures.
666,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
667,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,She moved like the night hawk
668,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Slowly sweeping across the moon sky.
669,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the proud lift of her head
670,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And the eagle look of her dark eye
671,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,From the red flower flame of her soft lips
672,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And the sureness of her being,"
673,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I could see that the heart of her
674,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Was like a wiry little war pony
675,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Swiftly racing up the steep trail of her breast
676,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With the hunt blood of the soft chase
677,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Fevering its questing nostrils.
678,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
679,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"No woman among our people,"
680,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Had seen the beauty of her robe,"
681,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"For she stood in flower white, flower fine doeskin,"
682,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Bleached and tanned like winter snowdrift,"
683,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Like the shining water flower face of far lakes,"
684,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Like the wide wing of a homing white swan,"
685,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Like the silver rays of the big cold hunting moon.
686,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
687,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,All around her feet fell soft knotted fringes
688,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Cut deep as the height of the first upstanding
689,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Of papooses ready to walk.
690,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,And her belt and her neck were deeply embroidered
691,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,With a thousand green stained quills
692,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From the backs of many porcupines,"
693,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,While her long heavy necklace
694,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Was got from traders crossing far seas,"
695,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,For it lay soft dull jade like the green wave meadow
696,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,In the deepest bay of the leaf tinted big sea water.
697,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
698,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
699,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"When one looked upon her searchingly,"
700,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"As I looked long upon her,"
701,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"That night of fat harvest thanksgiving,"
702,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Slowly one saw creeping from her bare arms,"
703,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"From her firm high breasts,"
704,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Over the dark gleaming bowed head
705,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"And sure slender shoulders of her,"
706,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,A faint waving cloud like fine blue mist
707,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,That could have been none other
708,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Than the secret power of the Great Spirit,"
709,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Stealing from her breast to wrap around her
710,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,So that any evil spirit magic
711,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Might not be strong to work against her.
712,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,
713,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,I could see that she was softer
714,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"Than our hard working women,"
715,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Though she had learned from the bee
716,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,"To be busy and useful,"
717,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,Though she had learned from the hunted fawn
718,THE LOVE DANCE OF YIADA,To travel far journeys in daring wingéd leaps.

729,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Ha! it were not enough
730,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That the stranger bore the song name
731,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the fire bird our tribe worshipped;
732,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"For on her breast, sheltered with one slim hand,"
733,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With flaming wings outspread,"
734,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And panting saw-edged beak like fire,"
735,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Lay a brother of the spirit bird,"
736,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Flame red, blood red, feathers like wounds--"
737,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Dead coal black of face;
738,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"A wild thing, sheltered and unafraid."
739,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
740,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In her language and with wave smooth sign talk
741,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She told the Great Sachem and our Chiefs
742,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That she had found it in the forest
743,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Wounded from the missed kill of the night bird
744,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Or bare escaped from the eager claws
745,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the hunger driven wildcat.

754,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
755,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Even as she told how she had found it,"
756,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She folded its wings against its full breast
757,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And set it upright on her steady finger.
758,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, it moved not, it fluttered not,"
759,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Though one bleeding wing hung broken.
760,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
761,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Where it had lain between her round breasts
762,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Its red sign stained the front of her white robe,"
763,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The mark of her soft heart of pity.
764,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
765,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, the face of the Great Sachem"
766,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Changed slowly as he watched our visitor;
767,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"He looked with understanding upon her,"
768,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He marvelled at the quiet bird.
769,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The heart of my Father, the White Wolf,"
770,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Grew tender as he studied her.
771,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
772,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,My own heart lay strange in my tormented breast
773,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Until swiftly she turned her face from the women
774,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Ever the grinders of the meal in our jars,"
775,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Ever the curers of the deer meat, and salmon,"
776,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The fillers and the guardians of the storehouses;
777,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And stretching her hand toward Mountain Lion,"
778,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,By strange words and by pretty sign talk
779,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She asked of him like coaxing birds:

786,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"As when, clinging trustingly to her firm finger,"
787,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The broken bird fed from her hand of pity.
788,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
789,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I could see the deep look, the inner trouble,"
790,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The battle in the heart of Mountain Lion,"
791,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When she held the bird toward him
792,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That it should drink, as do the wounded,"
793,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,From the polished mussel shell he had brought.
794,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
795,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"He looked, not at the broken bird, as we did,"
796,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But far into the eyes of Coüy-oüy,"
797,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The Princess of the Killimacs.
798,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, was it not a Brave's hour,"
799,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Was it not a Warrior's hour,"
800,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That hour in which I stood unflinching
801,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And saw her take him from me?
802,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I, whose heart had possessed him"
803,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Since we shot the play arrows of childhood,"
804,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And together chased the painted wings
805,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Through the flower fields of the Canawacs.
806,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
807,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then came Prairie Flower,"
808,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Mate of the Great Sachem,"
809,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To lead away the mighty strangers.
810,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For many suns and as many moons
811,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,We feasted and danced gaily.
812,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
813,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Was I not brave to wear fine robes,"
814,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Nightly to chant boastful songs?
815,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,My breast was torn and bleeding
816,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"As the broken wing of the fire bird,"
817,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Yet many searing times
818,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,At the command of the Great Sachem
819,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Was I made to smile in the Council Lodge,"
820,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And to dance the Love Dance of the Mandanas;
821,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That dance that I had learned in secret
822,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"From the flying feet of my Mother,"
823,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Learned only for Mountain Lion,"
824,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the great ceremonial of love giving.
825,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
826,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, Hear me!"
827,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Not again did the eyes of Mountain Lion
828,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Travel across the Council Lodge
829,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To seek my eyes in understanding.
830,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Coüy-oüy had taken his eyes;
831,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"On her face she proudly kept them,"
832,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"For he saw nought but the blue mist around her,"
833,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The gleam of her hair, the red bow of her lips."
834,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He heard nought but the luring music
835,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of her echo sweet voice,"
836,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the happy song of her quilled robe
837,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,As she hourly passed among our people;
838,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,While always clinging to her breast or shoulder
839,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Proud and fearless as in freedom,"
840,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Rode the sacred wounded bird of blood redness.
841,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
842,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her father homed in wigwams
843,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Near the lodge of the Great Sachem,"
844,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Rode his hunting pony on the far chase beside him,"
845,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Sat on high in the councils of our Chieftains.
846,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
847,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When the dancing and feasting were over
848,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,It was known through the voices of the criers
849,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That for many moons our visitors
850,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Would home beside our campfires,"
851,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Learning of our wisdom from us,"
852,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Teaching, where their customs differed."
853,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
854,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The Great Sachem was swift to order,"
855,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The rarest fish from sea or river,"
856,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The juiciest of the small birds
857,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"From the snares of the children,"
858,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The tenderest fawn flesh
859,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"From the arrows of the hunters,"
860,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To be brought for the cooking kettles
861,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the strangers who trusted us.
862,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
863,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Every day I watched the slow sun,"
864,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And at night I danced with the maidens,"
865,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But no sleep came to my eyes,"
866,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,No hunger came to my body.
867,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,My Mother tempted me with bits as sweet
868,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"As the Sachem had commanded for Coüy-oüy,"
869,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But my parched throat refused them in scorn,"
870,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"My dry tongue found no savour in juicy fatness,"
871,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,My hot hands could not place the beads evenly.
872,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
873,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then it was that my Mother came to my wigwam,"
874,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And closing the doorway she stood before me,"
875,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And long and long she looked far into my heart.
876,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Deep in her eyes there gathered the black fury,"
877,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And a storm like the wildest storm
878,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That ever twisted the cedars in wrath,"
879,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Raged in her rocking breasts
880,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And her lightning flashing eyes.
881,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
882,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Fiercely in the silent Canawac motion tongue,"
883,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Her look burning into my living spirit,"
884,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She made the sign of the quick kill;
885,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And turning she slipped like a vision
886,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,From my wigwam of torture.
887,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"As she crept into the mouth of darkness,"
888,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"O Medicine Man,"
889,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I knew that she had but made the outward sign
890,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the savage inward purpose
891,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Long hardening in my deepest heart.
892,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
893,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The next sun, when our mothers sent the maidens"
894,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With their baskets to the Fall nut gathering,"
895,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I kept ever close beside Coüy-oüy, my enemy,"
896,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And in my breast there flamed fierce anger,"
897,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That she had robbed my heart.
898,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
899,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Always at the door of her wigwam,"
900,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Rocking in the sunshine of each dawning,"
901,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Hung a yellow osier basket woven like a ball,"
902,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,With its ribs placed wide enough apart
903,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To give the gifts of light and air,"
904,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Close enough to prison a flame red bird.
905,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
906,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And there, healed of his wounds,"
907,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But forever broken for flight,"
908,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"On a twig shaped and placed by Mountain Lion,"
909,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Coüy-oüy, the flame feathered voyager of air,"
910,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Sang a song filled with tears and wailing,"
911,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The cry of a broken bird heart
912,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Pleading for wings and a mate.
913,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
914,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The Great Spirit heard his notes of sorrow,"
915,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,But I hardened my heart against the sacred bird;
916,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For his golden cage had been cunningly wrought
917,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,By hands of such great strength that naked
918,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,They had slain the mountain lion
919,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And taken its yellow skin for a ceremonial robe,"
920,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Its fierce name for the sign of a great deed.
921,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
922,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Now I saw in dazed wonder
923,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That Mountain Lion had grown papoose hearted.
924,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He was not leading the hunters in the forest;
925,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He was not at the head of the fishermen
926,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Spearing and netting as of old.
927,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He had proved his manhood in deadly combat;
928,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He had won his name by the fiercest fight
929,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Ever known among any of our warriors;
930,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But now he chose to lie in his wigwam and dream,"
931,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And I knew what he dreamed, O Medicine Man!"
932,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
933,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,So with soft words and pretty sign talk
934,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I led his evil spirit to the bright late flower;
935,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I showed her the little flitting creatures.
936,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And when I helped her fill her basket
937,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With sweet nuts that were greatly desired,"
938,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"My ear, quick for every sound of menace,"
939,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Marked the thing the softer one did not hear.
940,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
941,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"By a slender beckoning blue flower,"
942,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I measured the distance,"
943,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And skilfully I led the other nut pickers
944,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Far away from the spot of danger.
945,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Then I dared her to race in turn with me
946,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To leap the long leap across the nut bushes,"
947,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To land at the mark of the sky flower,"
948,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,A fair thing to shelter death.
949,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
950,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I set down my heaped basket of furry nuts,"
951,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I gathered my robe to my knees and raced swiftly,"
952,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I made the leap to which I challenged her,"
953,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Before her and all of the wondering maidens.
954,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
955,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She followed my footsteps like a rift of white light.
956,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She rose high in the air over the sweet nut bushes,"
957,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But she had not my strength, not my purpose."
958,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,My leap carried me far over the danger;
959,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,But as I turned quickly to watch her
960,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I saw her touch earth in smiling confidence,"
961,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,At the mark of the waving sky flower.
962,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
963,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When she tore away, her eyes wide in danger,"
964,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Dragging her robe from the clinging thicket,"
965,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With greedy eyed, death hungry heart"
966,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I watched her proud face.
967,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
968,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The Great Spirit had not pitied me,"
969,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"If the curved death serpent had struck at her,"
970,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,His awful fangs had missed her soft body.
971,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"O Medicine Man, make me magic for the fire bird,"
972,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Ease my spirit of the snaring water flower.
973,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
974,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Many suns I waited in hunger and spirit searching;
975,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Far and alone I wandered over the meadows,"
976,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Beside the white sand shore of the sea water.
977,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
978,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,One day I lost from my necklace
979,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"A carved piece of rare blue shell,"
980,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"A beautiful heaven tinted shell, a treasure,"
981,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Got from traders from the Islands of the seas
982,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Far to the south of us--across vast waters;
983,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,A big shell so precious among us that only one
984,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Cost us the weaving of fifty blankets;
985,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The greatest wealth known to our people.
986,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
987,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Slipping unseen from all the others,"
988,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I went alone through a trail of deep forest
989,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To the back of a far secret cavern I knew,"
990,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Where lay hidden my precious blue shell,"
991,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And I cut one small piece from it,"
992,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the mending of my necklace.
993,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When I came back to the sun, O Medicine Man,"
994,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And through the forest followed my trail,"
995,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I heard the rushing thunder footsteps
996,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the death growl of Black Bear.
997,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
998,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I looked, and I saw at the welcoming cavern mouth,"
999,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Hurrying in from the forest, the bloody killer,"
1000,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Mother black bear, gaunt and hard chased,"
1001,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,With far hanging tongue and foam dripping jaws;
1002,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And behind her, panting and whimpering,"
1003,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her pair of travel worn hungry little children.
1004,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1005,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Some far tribe had driven her from her home,"
1006,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And with her crying small ones following
1007,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She was seeking shelter in my treasure lodge.
1008,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1009,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I watched her turn and forbid her children to enter;
1010,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Alone, bravely to the inner recesses she went."
1011,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Her nose must have told her of my recent body,"
1012,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But she could lead her sleepy cubs no farther,"
1013,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the death weariness was upon all of them.
1014,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1015,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"So she came back to the cave's homing mouth,"
1016,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Drove her panting cubs to the farthest wall,"
1017,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And making fierce boastful war talk,"
1018,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,There she claimed the homing rights of the wild.
1019,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1020,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I went back to where our women were working
1021,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And I began the Brave's task of drilling my shell.
1022,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Coüy-oüy came and lay beside me, watching."
1023,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her tribes had no knowledge
1024,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of such rare precious ornaments.
1025,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She greatly desired to possess one
1026,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For her most precious bracelet.
1027,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1028,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When we were alone, as I worked"
1029,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I told her how to find my cavern
1030,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And where the shell was hidden on a high ledge.
1031,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1032,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her heart knew no fear;
1033,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her eyes shone with gladness
1034,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When I told her my great secret of blue treasure
1035,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And that, if she would go alone,"
1036,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She might take for herself one piece.
1037,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The one I was drilling so carefully I must use
1038,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the mending of my rarest necklace.
1039,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1040,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When I thought of the dripping jaws
1041,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the killer, ravenous, tormented to frenzy,"
1042,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And looked at the smoothness of her body,"
1043,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I relented; I knew mercy.
1044,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,It was in my softened heart
1045,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To say that the hunters must go with her;
1046,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,But before my lips of compassion
1047,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Could speak the words my heart said,"
1048,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With the joy light shining on her face,"
1049,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She told me in happy confidence:
1050,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""I will take but one small piece"
1051,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To ornament my richest bracelet,"
1052,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And I will polish it smooth even as you do,"
1053,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And Mountain Lion shall carve it for me."""
1054,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1055,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"O Medicine Man, look in mercy upon me!"
1056,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Darest say she drove not her own stake,"
1057,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Lighted her torture fire with fearless hands?
1058,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1059,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Darest say she knew not that Mountain Lion
1060,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Would now make her our Chieftainess?
1061,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Darest say the buzzing of a swarm of maidens
1062,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Had not told her many suns past
1063,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That Mountain Lion was my man,"
1064,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That he had danced the Mating Dance
1065,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the Mandanas with me,"
1066,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Before the assembly in the Council House
1067,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On the night of her coming among us?
1068,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1069,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,All that night my eyes surrounded her wigwam.
1070,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,With first dawn ray she came slipping forth
1071,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And darted down the veiled trail
1072,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That led through the deep forest.
1073,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1074,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Well had I marked the path
1075,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That ran to the cave's mouth.
1076,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When she had gone I closed the slender opening
1077,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Through which I had unceasingly watched
1078,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The moon's long journey for her,"
1079,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And for the first time in many pitiless suns
1080,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I fell into the deep visionless sleep
1081,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the body tired past endurance.
1082,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1083,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,It was near evening when my Mother wakened me.
1084,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She told me, her eyes burning deep into mine,"
1085,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,How hunters in the forest had found Coüy-oüy
1086,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Fleeing like a doe before the furious black killer.
1087,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1088,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When she fell, her utmost strength exhausted,"
1089,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Over her raged the foaming black death.
1090,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her beautiful breast and arms
1091,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Were forever shorn of their smoothness,"
1092,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But she lived, and her hateful face of allurement"
1093,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Her trouble-maker face, was untouched."
1094,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1095,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I knew what my Mother knew
1096,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When she turned from my doorway.
1097,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, the killer had not struck"
1098,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To the depth where life tented.
1099,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She had not sent my enemy to the Great Spirit.
1100,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She had only moved to compassion
1101,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The heart in the breast of Mountain Lion,"
1102,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"So that alone in his canoe he speared the rare fish,"
1103,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Alone on the mountains he sought the tender bird,"
1104,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Even the bright flower, the red leaf,"
1105,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To lay at her doorway--love's offering.
1106,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1107,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Well I knew that when she was healed
1108,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"He would stand tall and straight before her,"
1109,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And in his fierce pleading eyes
1110,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She would find the great understanding.
1111,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then, Medicine Man, despair settled in my heart;"
1112,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I shrivelled like the ungathered wild plum,"
1113,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I burned with a fierce, hot inward fire."
1114,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1115,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The day came when Coüy-oüy stood forth
1116,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Whitely robed in shining wonder,"
1117,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Untouched in her courage and her beauty
1118,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Save that she hid her arms with deep fringes.
1119,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1120,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"In bitterness of spirit I turned from her,"
1121,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I followed the long lonely trail
1122,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Through the fringed blue flower meadows.
1123,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I lay beside the small still waters of the flat lands,"
1124,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And I talked to my sister, the tall blue Heron"
1125,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,While she hunted food among the water flowers;
1126,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And I told the wise old Heron
1127,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"For the easement of my torture,"
1128,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I told her, O Medicine Man,"
1129,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,This same tale I tell you.
1130,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1131,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And then, Medicine Man,"
1132,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The Heron gave me a sure sign.
1133,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1134,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She stalked to where a great white flower
1135,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Was resting in serene beauty,"
1136,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Like a sheaf of fallen moons upon the water,"
1137,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And from beneath the safety of its shelter
1138,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She picked out my little frog brother so easily.
1139,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1140,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She tossed him clear and high in the air,"
1141,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And head first he shot down her long red gullet.
1142,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Then she looked at me questioningly
1143,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And awaited my understanding.
1144,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1145,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"So I slipped from my robe of doeskin,"
1146,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And fighting my way through the black muck,"
1147,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And the snares of the entangling round leaves,"
1148,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I gathered the white flower riding like a spirit canoe
1149,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That had sheltered fatness for my sister Heron.
1150,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1151,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Clean and white as storm foam I washed it,"
1152,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Carefully on the home trail I carried it,"
1153,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Like a living thing to my wigwam I took it,"
1154,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And I put it in a cooking kettle
1155,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Overflowing cold water from mountain torrent,"
1156,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Then I waited for the spirit to make me a sure sign.
1157,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1158,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That night, when Coüy-oüy's shadow touched me,"
1159,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Like a star fallen from on high was her beauty.
1160,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her eyes rested for the first time
1161,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On the white flower of the still waters.
1162,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On her knees she made a little medicine over it;
1163,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In her throat she chanted a hushed song
1164,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of exultation and worship,"
1165,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Over the wonder beauty of the white flower
1166,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That she had never known
1167,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"In the far, cold land of the Killimacs."
1168,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1169,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On her face there was a veiling breath mist
1170,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Like the softest ray from the lovers' moon;
1171,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,All around her wrapped the blue light blanket
1172,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That seemed to steal from her body
1173,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Creeping through her white robe.
1174,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1175,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then, Medicine Man, I told her this fair tale:"
1176,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That I loved a young Brave
1177,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Son of the mighty Eagle Feather,"
1178,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The Chief of a high mountain tribe far north of us,"
1179,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And that when he saw me in the deep forest
1180,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Holding up high the fair water flower
1181,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The lure of its white magic
1182,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Would make in his cold heart
1183,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That strong medicine I needed,"
1184,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To bring him face to face with me
1185,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In that great understanding
1186,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Which is followed by union, among our tribes."
1187,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1188,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"O Medicine Man, I told her by word"
1189,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And by convincing sign talk
1190,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That if her heart ran soft as gold sweetness
1191,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"At the coming of any of our young Braves,"
1192,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And her roving eyes flew to them
1193,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Searching for loving understanding,"
1194,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Until she feared they would betray her,"
1195,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And the tongue of her heart pled for them,"
1196,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And her willing hands thought sweet sign talk--
1197,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"If she would hold aloft the white flower,"
1198,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That she had gathered from the water,"
1199,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Deep in the thickness of the forest
1200,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Where none but her Brave could see it,"
1201,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,It would surely make for her the great magic
1202,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That would draw him straight to the flame
1203,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the candle she set before her wigwam.
1204,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1205,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Long and long and long again
1206,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She watched the white flower.
1207,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,All her heart melted at its gold heart sweetness;
1208,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And then she looked deep into my eyes,"
1209,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To spirit depths she searched me carefully,"
1210,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,But pride would not let me quail before her.
1211,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1212,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She knew she had barely missed
1213,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The peril of the death snake:
1214,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She had sent hunters to bring its rattles for her.
1215,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She knew she had faced the red death
1216,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,By the black killer of the treasure cave;
1217,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Yet was my spirit so strong over her doubting
1218,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That once again in the chill of early morning
1219,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She set her proud feet confidently
1220,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On the forest trail I pictured for her.
1221,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1222,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She knew not how the white flower
1223,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the still water lifted to the sun,"
1224,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She knew not the wind reeds and flute rushes.
1225,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1226,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I told her the path her feet must follow alone,"
1227,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That when she saw a white flower
1228,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Like a rocking canoe cradled by soft wind,"
1229,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Riding on the breast of the blue water,"
1230,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She should leave her robe in the deep forest,"
1231,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She should run like the chased antelope,"
1232,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And leap from the sand shore
1233,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To the resting place of the flower.
1234,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She should snatch it in her hand, hold it high,"
1235,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And swim back to the red beach of dawning.
1236,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1237,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
1238,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I sent her not on the meadow path
1239,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Where the war ponies fattened.
1240,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I sent her not to the still black water
1241,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the singing reeds and rushes,"
1242,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Where the charmed spirit flowers
1243,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,With sun hearts and snow faces
1244,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Spread in flocks like feeding gulls
1245,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Over the breast of the dark waters.
1246,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1247,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Medicine Man, I sent her straight to that one spot"
1248,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"On the sands of the great sea water in the deep bay,"
1249,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In the sheltered cove of the soundless depths
1250,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Where every Canawac knew there crouched waiting
1251,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The hungry Monster of the lazy sucking sands.
1252,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1253,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Again I watched all the moon time
1254,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And in the gold red morning
1255,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She slipped from her wigwam
1256,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And entered the ancient forest.
1257,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Soft as flame ascending, swift as night bird flying,"
1258,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I circled past her among my familiar tree brothers.
1259,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Long before her coming to the bay of torture,"
1260,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I dropped the snaring white flower,"
1261,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Fresh and lovely, a convincing decoy,"
1262,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Far into the heart of the pitiless death pool
1263,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Where the eager mouths of the swallowing sands
1264,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Embrace and draw, quietly, but so surely"
1265,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"That no strength of arm can lift,"
1266,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,No power of spirit can save their victim.
1267,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1268,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Behind the rocks I hid and waited;
1269,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In anguish I prayed to the Great Spirit
1270,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That the luring white flower of wonder
1271,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Might rest on the gently heaving water
1272,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Until the time of the coming of my enemy.
1273,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1274,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"As I waited with my eyes ever watching, watching"
1275,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The wave cradled flower white as swan feathers,"
1276,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Through the air shot the slim scarred form
1277,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of Coüy-oüy, my hated enemy."
1278,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1279,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her slender feet touched the water
1280,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And went down softly as a diving bird,"
1281,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Her reaching hand caught the white flower surely.
1282,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1283,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She lifted her face to the face of the morning;
1284,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The beauty that shone upon her
1285,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Was like the beauty of the Great Spirit
1286,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When he had first the vision of the flower world
1287,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the wonder of flower magic was sent to him.
1288,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1289,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Coüy-oüy held the water flower in high triumph;
1290,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She gazed at it, she laughed to it, she kissed it,"
1291,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"She laid it against her glad face like a papoose,"
1292,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And chanted to it throaty words of lullaby.
1293,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Then with the other hand and with her quick feet
1294,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She began swimming to reach the certain shore.
1295,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1296,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When her light feet would not lift to the surface
1297,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And her strong stroke would not move her body,"
1298,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Slowly the dawn light faded from her face
1299,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And a look like the look of a little hurt papoose
1300,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Came over her in slow wonder--
1301,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"A look of surprise, of doubt"
1302,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That her strength could be unavailing.
1303,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1304,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then she struggled like an arrow stricken sea bird,"
1305,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,For the sure sands grip their captive cruelly.
1306,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1307,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then gray terrors came sweeping upon her,"
1308,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And her face was white, white as the white flower"
1309,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,That she held at arm's length above her.
1310,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1311,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Her black oiled braids floated out on the water,"
1312,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"While a cry, a shrill cry, a high screaming cry,"
1313,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The voice of a wounded mountain lion,"
1314,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Rang from her lips in quivering terror.
1315,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1316,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I knew who had carefully taught her
1317,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,To use that cry in time of trouble:
1318,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I knew that for my Brave she was calling.
1319,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And I knew, too, how the wood and the water"
1320,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Carried sound far distances to wild ears.
1321,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1322,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I wondered if Mountain Lion were on the water
1323,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Or if he were hunting the wide forest
1324,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Or if he were drilling ornaments of blue shell
1325,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Or weaving the sacred, singing fire bird"
1326,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,A new wigwam of gold osiers.
1327,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1328,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Only once she screamed that awful wild cry,"
1329,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Then her struggles were the final battle.
1330,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Already her face of anguish was even
1331,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With the treacherous water hiding death,"
1332,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Already her slender body was forever encased.
1333,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1334,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,One arm slowly beat the fair bay helplessly;
1335,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"But even as the gray terror closed in upon her,"
1336,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The stealthy catlike death of the waves
1337,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And the little famished mouths of sand,"
1338,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The slow mealy strangling sands,"
1339,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She bravely held aloft the white flower.
1340,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1341,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And then, Medicine Man, I cared not if he came,"
1342,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The Mountain Lion, my faithless man!"
1343,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The utmost reach of his strength could not save her,"
1344,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He might go down to bottomless depths with her;
1345,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He might strive and bear me down to her.
1346,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Come was my just and rightful hour of triumph!
1347,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1348,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I arose and went forth on the white shore
1349,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I smiled like a mother upon her,"
1350,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then I pointed my finger, I laughed in scorn,"
1351,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I made bad sign talk at her,"
1352,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I danced the Braves' triumph dance, with song,"
1353,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I cried to her in the exultation of victory:
1354,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""He will not come again to you,"
1355,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The faithless Mountain Lion, my man,"
1356,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He who danced the sacred Mating Dance
1357,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the Mandanas with me in the Council Lodge,"
1358,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He who read into my eyes the great understanding
1359,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Even upon the night of your coming among us.
1360,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Go thou back to the evil spirits who sent thee!"""
1361,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1362,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Until the last wave overran her eyes,"
1363,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The slim thing of bone hardness,"
1364,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of arrow straightness, and sureness,"
1365,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of bird swiftness, would not look once upon me,"
1366,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Would not plead with me for mercy
1367,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Nor sign for help at my hands.
1368,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When she saw me she suddenly ceased to struggle,"
1369,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And with her eyes fixed upon the white flower,"
1370,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The fallen moon that rides the still black water,"
1371,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She went to bottomless depths silently;
1372,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Slowly, slowly, Medicine Man, she sank,"
1373,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Until the flower again rested
1374,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,On the breast of the unconscious water.
1375,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1376,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then I went into the forest on her trail,"
1377,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I hunted her precious robe of snow white doeskin,"
1378,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I rolled a heavy stone in its rich bead work:
1379,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I carried it back swiftly,"
1380,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And upon the face of the white flower
1381,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Slowly sinking beneath the water I threw it.
1382,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1383,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then I knelt in cunning like the fox,"
1384,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And swiftly working my way backward,"
1385,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"With my steady, careful fingers"
1386,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I sifted the sands over our footsteps,"
1387,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Until I came to the feather grass
1388,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the dry leaves of the deep forest.
1389,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1390,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Like the hunted I ran to the safety of my wigwam,"
1391,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I buried myself in my soft robes of satisfaction,"
1392,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"My heart laughed in victory,"
1393,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The sleep I had lost for many mocking moons
1394,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"While my brain thought snares,"
1395,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Now settled heavy, like sickness upon me."
1396,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1397,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Even as I slept in deep stupor,"
1398,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"There came dreams and yet again dreams,"
1399,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,But they were not familiar dreams
1400,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the low humming rattler
1401,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Nor the foaming mouth of the knife footed killer.
1402,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I dreamed that over my heart flamed and scorched
1403,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And burned Coüy-oüy, the little sacred red bird;"
1404,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,While my hands could not braid
1405,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And put the gay ornaments in my hair,"
1406,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Could not put on my robe,"
1407,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Could not tie my moccasins,"
1408,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Could not lift food to my hungry mouth,"
1409,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Because they were full of the white flowers
1410,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,From the land of the still water.
1411,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1412,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When the alarum cries sounded
1413,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And the ponies' feet thundered,"
1414,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When the hunting dogs raged
1415,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And shrill clamour arose in the camp,"
1416,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"My Mother shook me,"
1417,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And long she looked deep into my eyes
1418,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And I looked into her eyes;
1419,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And then in the silent talk of our tribe
1420,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I made the swift going down sign
1421,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Of the Monster sands of the far bay.
1422,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1423,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,There was no triumph on her face
1424,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When she slowly turned from me,"
1425,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And fear was born in my heart
1426,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Because I clearly saw its awful image
1427,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When it sprang into life in the deeps of her eyes.
1428,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1429,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When the scouts and hunters were gathering,"
1430,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"When the visiting Chief was threatening,"
1431,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"And all of our Chiefs were in secret council,"
1432,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"While the women were wailing the death cry,"
1433,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"There came to my lodge in that hour,"
1434,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The footsteps I had always awaited.
1435,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,So I passed through my doorway
1436,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And in the revealing sunlight
1437,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"I stood before Mountain Lion,"
1438,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Terrible to face in his deep rage.
1439,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1440,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,With dazed hand I drew sleep from my eyes;
1441,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I met his gaze stupidly with smiling face;
1442,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When he saw this he was forced to doubt
1443,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,The thing he had come expecting to see.
1444,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When he tried to look far into my eyes for a sign
1445,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,He saw only stupid Old Man Sleep sitting there
1446,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Mocking the tortured heart in his breast.
1447,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1448,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Then he caught me fiercely by the shoulders,"
1449,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"He drew me close to him,"
1450,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"He forced my eyes to meet his,"
1451,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And low and hoarse he cried to me in torture:
1452,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""She jumped to the mark of the sky flower,"
1453,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the snake with death in its mouth was there;
1454,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"The mark was the mark you set for her, Yiada."
1455,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1456,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""She went to the far, lonely cave"
1457,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Of the chased and hungry black death,"
1458,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And the rare shell that she sought
1459,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Was a part of your treasure, Yiada."
1460,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1461,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""Again she is missing, evil spirits know how long,"
1462,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,What torture death have you sent her seeking now--
1463,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Coüy-oüy, my brave fire bird, my woman?"""
1464,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1465,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"O Medicine Man, if he had not said soft words,"
1466,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I might have told him as he held me before him.
1467,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I might have braved the storm of his wrath
1468,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,And made my journey to the Great Spirit
1469,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In that menacing breath.
1470,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,When I saw that she lived in my place
1471,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In the secret tent of his heart
1472,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,I laughed at him and I cried tauntingly:
1473,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"""She is chasing painted wings"
1474,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,In the pasture meadows of the valley.
1475,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She is at the still pool hunting the water flower:
1476,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,She would use its white magic
1477,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"To snare your wild heart,"
1478,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,Even as she used the red magic of the fire bird.
1479,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Go and seek her, O mighty hunter!"
1480,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,"Go and seek--until you find her!"""
1481,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,
1482,COÜY-OÜY AND MOUNTAIN LION,

1489,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1490,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When the hunters had raced from our village
1491,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Toward the land of ice,"
1492,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Toward the land of hot suns,"
1493,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Toward the land of dawn,"
1494,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And where the sun dives in the sea,"

1496,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Between the paths of their going,"
1497,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,On their stoutest ponies
1498,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Rode the young women and the squaws
1499,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Who could be spared with safety
1500,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From the watch of the campfires
1501,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the care of the little happy children.

1503,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,[Illustration:
1504,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,

1506,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Writing mating signs on the blue sky of Heaven
1507,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Flashed his quick hands of entreaty,"
1508,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"In the little love sign talk he taught her._"""
1509,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,]
1510,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1511,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Foremost among these I rode on my fastest pony,"
1512,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,But to my Mother I made a secret sign
1513,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To remain in waiting by her campfire
1514,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And yet the swifter sign of the quick return.
1515,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1516,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Because I was first in the fish drying
1517,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The berry picking of earth and mountain,"
1518,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The gathering of seeds of all kinds
1519,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the work of the women,"
1520,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The other maidens went where I sent them.
1521,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Then swiftly I made a wide circle
1522,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And slipped back to the lodge of my Mother,"
1523,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And leaving my pony in the tented forest
1524,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I crept to the door of my Father,"
1525,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Unseen by any of the watchers.
1526,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1527,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,There I lay in hiding
1528,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,While my Mother worked silently.
1529,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"She rolled a bundle of my finest robes,"
1530,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"My moccasins, my best bow and full quiver,"
1531,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Big strips of smoked venison,"
1532,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Dried fish and bear and deer meat,"
1533,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Nuts and tallow cake and dried berries,"
1534,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the last little sweet meal cake
1535,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That her hands would ever make me.
1536,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1537,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When Old Man Moon made soft talk
1538,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"In his canoe among the clouds,"
1539,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From the back of the lodge of my Father I crept
1540,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,After I had stood long and again long
1541,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Before my Mother, racked in fierce anguish,"
1542,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And made her many signs of the great crossing,"
1543,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For we knew that never again should I see her.
1544,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1545,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,We made long straight talk between us
1546,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That when the others returned from the search
1547,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I should be missing, as was Coüy-oüy,"
1548,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,So that a new search would be made for my body.
1549,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Then should she cry the death wail
1550,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Through the length of all our village for me;
1551,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And make high prayer to the Great Spirit
1552,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For my safe crossing to the Happy Lands.
1553,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1554,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thus her lodge and wigwams
1555,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And my Father and brothers
1556,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Would be saved from all suspicion of treachery,"
1557,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And to the mourning of the Great Chief
1558,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Who visited our campfires in confidence,"
1559,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Would be added the wailing of our tribe for Yiada.
1560,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1561,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I rode my Father's swiftest remaining pony,"
1562,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I turned my face between the sun's rising
1563,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the hot suns of the South.
1564,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I slipped through the forest and on, and on,"
1565,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Each moon on, and again on,"
1566,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Fast and far as the pony could run, I journeyed"
1567,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,In the direction where my Mother had told me
1568,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Lay the encampment of her people, the Mandanas."
1569,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1570,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When the tired pony could travel no farther
1571,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I let him feed and rest and drink;
1572,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And then again I rode, moon after moon,"
1573,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Until he grew lean as deep snow gray wolf.
1574,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When I had eaten the last crumb of meal cake,"
1575,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And there was nothing left in my bundle,"
1576,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"But tough strings of deer meat,"
1577,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I came one sun-rising to signs of the Mandanas.
1578,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1579,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Then, O Medicine Man,"
1580,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I slipped from the pony and bathed carefully,"
1581,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I oiled my body, braided my hair with ornaments"
1582,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And I put on a snow white robe
1583,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Whose bleaching had been taught my Mother
1584,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,By Coüy-oüy as a secret art.
1585,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I stripped the beads and the obsidian
1586,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From my heaviest necklace for ceremonials
1587,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And wore only the sky water blue
1588,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of the precious blue shell.
1589,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1590,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When I looked into the shining water
1591,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Above the white sands of the lake bed,"
1592,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I saw in my face great beauty like high magic,"
1593,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Wrought by the fear painter, the hunger moon,"
1594,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The far stealthy journey, the anxious heart--"
1595,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Beauty even greater than the beauty of Coüy-oüy.
1596,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1597,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And so, O Medicine Man,"
1598,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,At fire lighting I rode into the village.
1599,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The spies and the couriers raced before me,"
1600,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Crying the wonder of my coming,"
1601,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The fierce, snarling dogs yapped after me,"
1602,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The frightened children ran from me,"
1603,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Angered squaws with harsh voices
1604,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Cried threatening, forbidding words at me."
1605,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1606,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When I came to the door of the Council House
1607,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"At the head of the long village of fatness,"
1608,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I slipped from my pony, and leading him after me"
1609,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I walked to the feet of the Great Chief
1610,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Sitting in solemn state on his throne;
1611,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I gave him the deeps of my troubled spirit.
1612,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1613,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,My eyes slowly unfolded to his eyes
1614,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The tale of the robbed heart,"
1615,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of the tortured sleep, of the lone moon trail,"
1616,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of a fugitive from the arrows of an enemy.
1617,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1618,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With Mandan speech and by the sign language
1619,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I told him that I was of his blood,"
1620,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of his tribe through my Mother;
1621,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Seeking refuge with her people,"
1622,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And I told him, O Medicine Man,"
1623,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"These things of woe, I now tell you."
1624,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1625,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Beside him came the Great Chiefs and wise men,"
1626,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Around him the warriors, the spies and hunters;"
1627,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"While back of the chiefs, dim in the firelight,"
1628,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Again and again I felt the eye of a mighty hunter,"
1629,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"A young Brave, with the broad shoulders"
1630,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The round face of compassion,"
1631,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the softer eye of the Mandanas
1632,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of the lands where peace homed securely.
1633,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1634,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Little of my story had I told the Chieftain,"
1635,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"As straight and fearless I faced him,"
1636,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Before I knew in my heart that over his head
1637,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I was speaking to the stirred heart of his son.
1638,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I was asking of him rest and meat, and tribe rights,"
1639,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Even as Coüy-oüy had asked meal and water
1640,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of Mountain Lion, instead of our women,"
1641,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the broken fire bird that rested on her breast.
1642,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1643,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,As I asked I knew the answer in his heart;
1644,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For I was tall and I was seasoned,"
1645,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And I was tortured beyond bearing,"
1646,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And I was beautiful with a living spirit beauty
1647,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Far above that of the Mandan women around me.
1648,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1649,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When they learned that my Mother
1650,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Was of their tribe in her youth,"
1651,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That I had fled as the hunted for cave rights,"
1652,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"They held counsel, and they set me a tall wigwam;"
1653,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"They gave me the rich food of a welcome guest,"
1654,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And they led me to my wrinkled, gray grandfather."
1655,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1656,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The great council of Chiefs and Medicine Men,"
1657,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The wise men and all of the young Braves
1658,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Made Mandan sign talk to hold me securely,"
1659,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"As if born of their tribe and village,"
1660,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Even if Mountain Lion suspected treachery
1661,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And rode in war paint against them for vengeance.
1662,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1663,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Then was my body lazy with rich comfort
1664,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,But my spirit was gray ashes
1665,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Burned out by the flames of the fire bird
1666,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Nesting in the heart of my breast.
1667,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I was all over sick for my Mother,"
1668,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For my brothers and my Father, who loved me,"
1669,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For the clear sky, the heavy clouds,"
1670,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the taunting water of the restless sea,"
1671,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For the fat grass, the flower valleys"
1672,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the tall mountains, with head-bands of snow,"
1673,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For the night fires of village and Council Lodge,"
1674,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the little honey cakes of my Mother;
1675,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,While I dared not even remember
1676,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The face of Mountain Lion's agony,"
1677,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"As I tortured him in derision,"
1678,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And he turned from me in hot anger.
1679,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1680,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"As the sign was in the deep eyes of Star Face,"
1681,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Son of the Great Chief, the night of my coming,"
1682,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,So it was in the suns that followed.
1683,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Well I knew that in the day
1684,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he saw candle lighting in my eyes
1685,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,His willing feet would dance before me
1686,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The hated Love Dance of the Mandanas.
1687,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1688,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"He was a broad Brave, a fierce Brave, a warrior."
1689,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He would sit at the council in the seat of his father
1690,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he had made his last journey
1691,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To the far Spirit Lands of final peace.
1692,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,His earth-lodge would be warm
1693,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"With the skins of beaver, mink and otter;"
1694,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,While the white dress of a great Princess
1695,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"From the bleached and softened doeskin,"
1696,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Beaded with the sign of the Chief's mate,"
1697,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Would cover my sick heart with the robe of pride.
1698,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1699,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"So hard I worked, O Medicine Man,"
1700,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"From the lifting to the setting of every sun,"
1701,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"So long I danced at night in the Assembly Lodge,"
1702,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That when I walked to my wigwam
1703,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Sleep came swift and deep upon me.
1704,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1705,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Sometimes I lay visionless,"
1706,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,My body worn to stone heaviness;
1707,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Sometimes the flaming bird burned my breast
1708,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To gray ashes, like dead campfires,"
1709,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the white lilies overflowed my unwilling hands
1710,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Until I fought to keep from choking among them,"
1711,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Even as Coüy-oüy was smothered
1712,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,By the little yielding wave hidden sands.
1713,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1714,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When I had worked that season
1715,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Until the troubling mating moon
1716,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Sailed like a polished pearl canoe in the Spring sky,"
1717,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When the hurrying blood of the trees
1718,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Ran fast in the red and yellow osiers,"
1719,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When the birches, givers of large gifts,"
1720,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Put out their little talking leaves of gold,"
1721,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When strange birds made love chase in the forest
1722,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the fish leaped high from the shallow water
1723,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"As the yellow spawn they planted and quickened,"
1724,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,There came a night of quivering moon magic
1725,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When, after all the others had assembled,"
1726,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Star Face entered the Council Lodge,"
1727,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"His head lifted to face the star country,"
1728,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the great wealth of his riches
1729,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Rode flauntingly from head-band to moccasins.
1730,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1731,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"He had scoured his skin to fatling softness,"
1732,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"He had oiled his body to birch bark smoothness,"
1733,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"His braided hair was filled with eagle feathers,"
1734,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With quill feathers of white swan
1735,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And wing pinions of wild turkey.
1736,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1737,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He was robed in the soft gray skins of the otter;
1738,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,On his feet were beaded moccasins of deerskin;
1739,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,In his hand was a broad fan of the wing feathers
1740,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of the proud and contented white swan,"
1741,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Round his neck lay heavy shining ornaments
1742,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Made from the teeth and the cutting claws
1743,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of many black and brown bear,"
1744,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of fierce mountain lion and wildcat,"
1745,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the big teeth of the elk and moose,"
1746,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Carved copper and cunningly pierced bone beads,"
1747,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From obsidian and little singing shells.
1748,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1749,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The dance of the maidens was beginning
1750,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he entered in high pride.
1751,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He came through the long Lodge
1752,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And stood with compelling eye before me,"
1753,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And before his Father on the throne,"
1754,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And his Mother, his brothers and sisters,"
1755,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The whole council of Chiefs and wise men
1756,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And all the assembled people of his tribe.
1757,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1758,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Slowly he began the Mating Dance
1759,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of the Mandana who would prevail,"
1760,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,While his eyes like coals from the campfire
1761,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Seared my body to action--
1762,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The eyes of black bear when he is facing the hunter,"
1763,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The fierce eyes of the starving panther
1764,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When the hunger moon is shining,"
1765,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The scouting eyes of the eagle of high spaces,"
1766,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Seeking a mate in the far country of the stars.
1767,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1768,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he had danced the dance of allurement
1769,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To the last stamped out measure,"
1770,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Straightway I walked to the feet
1771,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of his powerful Father, on his throne,"
1772,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And in the speech of the Mandanas I said to him:
1773,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"""Great Chief, thou hast seen the dance"
1774,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of thy mighty son, Star Face."
1775,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,If I dance the ancient Mating Dance
1776,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of the unconquered Mandanas
1777,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"This night before thee, for Star Face,"
1778,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Even as he has danced before thee, for me,"
1779,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Great and powerful Chief, am I of thy people?"""
1780,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1781,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The Great Chief looked into my eyes and said:
1782,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"""Thou art of mine, even as Star Face is my son;"
1783,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"With our last arrow, with our last battle axe,"
1784,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With the stoutest blood of our hearts
1785,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Will our Braves defend thee forever."""
1786,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1787,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The next sun, the young women"
1788,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Set me a tall prideful wigwam apart.
1789,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,They bathed and oiled my heart sick body;
1790,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,They beaded and feathered fine robes
1791,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the mating ceremonials of a rich Brave.
1792,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1793,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,In another tent all of the young men
1794,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Were busy preparing Star Face for our union.
1795,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1796,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Down the long wide trail
1797,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of the swarming, bee like village"
1798,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The painted criers on swift horses
1799,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Were announcing the marriage of Yiada,"
1800,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Daughter of the far and friendly Canawacs,"
1801,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And Star Face, the son of the Head Chief"
1802,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of the boastful Mandanas--the proud ones!
1803,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1804,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"So, with the full Mandan ceremonial,"
1805,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I gave my tortured body to Star Face.
1806,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1807,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"There was no heart left in me, O Medicine Man,"
1808,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And that Star Face might not miss it,"
1809,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When he looked in my eyes in tenderness,"
1810,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I gave to him such willing and sure service
1811,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,As no other Chief of the Mandanas had ever known.
1812,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1813,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Soft were the skins that bedded his wigwams,"
1814,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Warm his earth-lodge against the sting of winter,"
1815,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Sweet was the crisp squaw bread
1816,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That bubbled in his fat kettles,"
1817,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Gold was the mountain of tallow
1818,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Stacked in his storehouse for winter,"
1819,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,High heaped were the nuts of tree and bush
1820,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Gathered and husked against the Ice Chief,"
1821,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Rich were the berries dried with sunshine,"
1822,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Boiled back to tenderness, honey sweetened."
1823,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1824,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And, Medicine Man,"
1825,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,No other Brave served his mate as Star Face.
1826,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,High and boastful was his pride
1827,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When I gave him a straight little chieftain,"
1828,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And great to pain was my joy
1829,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When I oiled the little fatling:
1830,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the fire ever burning in my heart
1831,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Had not scorched his small body,"
1832,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The fulness of my hands had set no mark upon him.
1833,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1834,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He was a young chieftain of spirit magic
1835,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Who in suns before his coming to my lodge,"
1836,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Had ridden on the backs of milk white fawns
1837,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Over the floating thistle seed trail
1838,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That we saw nightly in the country of the stars,"
1839,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Who had played with baby beavers
1840,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"In their village at the creek's mouth,"
1841,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Who had hunted canyon ways,"
1842,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Stout heart with bear and panther,"
1843,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Who had sailed over tall mountains with the eagle,"
1844,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Who had hung in the eye of the sun
1845,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"With the silver winged falcon,"
1846,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Who had fished angry waters with the crafty mink,"
1847,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Who had raced among the white birches
1848,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"With the soft eyed does of Spring,"
1849,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And slept deep with his tall blue heron brothers
1850,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,In their rough nests among the wailing cedars.
1851,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1852,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Every sun I watched him,"
1853,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Every moon my fear-filled hand was on him.
1854,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Ever his gay cradle was light in my eye
1855,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Its tinkling shells sweet music in my ears.
1856,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he could walk with strength
1857,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I led him to the meadows, to the forest,"
1858,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And I taught him--thou knowest,"
1859,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"O Medicine Man, thou knowest well,"
1860,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,How carefully I taught him
1861,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Our every custom and tradition;
1862,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And how Star Face trained him with the bow,"
1863,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To fish the rough waters, to ride the wild ponies,"
1864,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And how he taught him all the laws and customs
1865,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For young Braves who would be warriors.
1866,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1867,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thou knowest how all of the tribe shouted
1868,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When first he sat his pony alone,"
1869,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And rode it through the village at its racing speed.
1870,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And then, O Medicine Man, thou knowest the day"
1871,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When first he strayed far from me
1872,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"With the little curious feet of childhood,"
1873,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And now, now, I hear the wild shrieks of terror"
1874,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When the snake that has death in its mouth
1875,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Struck its pitiless fangs into his tender flesh.
1876,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1877,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When his little blanket wrapped body,"
1878,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Looking so long and straight, and lonely,"
1879,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Was carried to the far, haunted death village"
1880,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All the forest echoed wild cries of mourning
1881,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From a thousand wigwams of desolation
1882,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And earth-lodges that loved him.
1883,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1884,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"My stiff lips made no sound,"
1885,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"My robbed hands lay death's captive,"
1886,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For my eyes saw again the nut thicket,"
1887,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the thing the sky flower sheltered,"
1888,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,My ears again heard the soft buzzing menace.
1889,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Well I knew that Coüy-oüy
1890,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Had escaped the watchful Great Spirit,"
1891,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That she had come back to earth
1892,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To strike me through the death snake,"
1893,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That hers were the fangs of poison
1894,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Buried deep in my little fatling.
1895,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1896,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest, Medicine Man,"
1897,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"How another little chief came to me,"
1898,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And how again, with all the wild magic"
1899,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"All the wisdom of our tribe,"
1900,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All the strength in our power
1901,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And the cunning of our hearts of love,"
1902,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The great Star Face, and I, his strong mate,"
1903,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Strove over the life of our son.
1904,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1905,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thou knowest how he shouted
1906,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When to us there came a little sister.
1907,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And then the black day, that dread day"
1908,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest well as any,"
1909,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When tall and straight he entered the forest alone
1910,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To strive for the first vision from the Great Spirit.
1911,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1912,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Without food and without sleep
1913,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I knelt silent in my lonely wigwam;
1914,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With one hand ever easing my burning breast
1915,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With the other I fought back
1916,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The slowly rising tide of the white flowers,"
1917,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The luring spirit flowers of destruction
1918,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That home on the still lake waters.
1919,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I needed not the chilling death cry
1920,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That came to my ears three suns later:
1921,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I knew surely that my little chieftain
1922,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Would not come back to me from the forest.
1923,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1924,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He still breathed when the hunters
1925,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Brought before me his stout body
1926,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Ripped deep by the cruel knives of the killer.
1927,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1928,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The black death, man's height and buffalo heavy,"
1929,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Lay dead in the far uptorn pitying forest
1930,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Where they had battled for their lives.
1931,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,It had been the greatest fight
1932,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That youth had ever waged in our tribe.
1933,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1934,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All night the anxious Medicine Men
1935,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Made their strongest Medicine for him;
1936,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,But the green sickness was eating his slender body.
1937,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"In the morning, O Medicine Man,"
1938,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Coüy-oüy again danced her triumph dance,"
1939,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Again scored victory over me,"
1940,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When our unavailing death wail
1941,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Beat against the copper face of heaven
1942,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For my little chieftain, my brave little warrior."
1943,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1944,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Because of her pointing finger no cry would I utter.
1945,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Silently in my tortured wigwam
1946,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I writhed in the flame of the fire bird
1947,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And choked with the rising sick sweetness
1948,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of the hated water flower of the pasture lands.
1949,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1950,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,But ever I held in a tight grasp
1951,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The clutching hand of little fat face,"
1952,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And my ears ached with her shrill wail
1953,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the long journey of her brother;
1954,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For she had ridden his racing pony
1955,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Before him on the saddle on far trails,"
1956,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And gathered gay flowers in the valleys
1957,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"On the coloured faces of high hills,"
1958,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And brought me the little juicy birds
1959,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"From the snares of cunning set in the valleys,"
1960,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And chased the war painted wings
1961,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Where the hunting ponies pastured.
1962,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
1963,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Darest say I had not killing torture?
1964,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1965,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When the burning of the fire bird was past bearing,"
1966,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When the stifling cloud of the white flowers
1967,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Sickened my body to leanness,"
1968,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I arose and began skin dressing and fish drying
1969,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And seed grinding and weaving blankets.
1970,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1971,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All of the squaws and the young women
1972,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Pointed taunting mischievous fingers
1973,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When, silent, I passed among them."
1974,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"They said: ""She is possessed of a devil;"
1975,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Evil spirits drive her with secret arrows,"
1976,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,It is with strength stolen from the Spirits
1977,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That she works every sun at the fish drying,"
1978,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The meat curing, the seed gathering"
1979,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And the making of tents not needed.
1980,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1981,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"But ever, when far grown I carried little Dove Eye,"
1982,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Little cooing bird, on my aching shoulders,"
1983,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Ever I pressed her against my burning heart:
1984,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I would not trust her to the stoutest cradle.
1985,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Tightly I held her that from my fear strong hands
1986,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,She might not be pushed out by the white flowers.
1987,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
1988,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When her stumbling little feet of uncertainty
1989,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Carried her to the willing knees of Star Face,"
1990,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Like the first dawn of Spring long awaited
1991,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Came the light to his hungry eyes,"
1992,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Like the soft talking brook water
1993,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Came the sweet words in his throat;
1994,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Like the wings of a snow white sea swallow
1995,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Writing mating signs on the blue sky of heaven
1996,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Flashed his quick hands of entreaty,"
1997,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,In the little love sign talk he taught her.
1998,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Many suns he sat grinding small beads of bone
1999,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Every little rare white shell he found,"
2000,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And polishing squirrel and otter teeth
2001,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the necklace she wore so proudly.
2002,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2003,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Never did I leave my hands free of her
2004,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Unless the hands of Star Face were upon her.
2005,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When he made signs of soft pale-faces
2006,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I made signs of the passing of spirits,"
2007,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,So he saw that my hands ever upon her
2008,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Were only that I might hold her back
2009,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From the land of the great Unseen;
2010,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For only these three, Medicine Man,"
2011,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Only these three little people,"
2012,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The Great Spirit sent to my lodge,"
2013,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,From the far land of cradle filling.
2014,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2015,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Always when we came near still or running water
2016,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I held her with the hug of black bear.
2017,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Before she might chase the little fishes,"
2018,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Even in the shallow inshore water of the bays,"
2019,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Or hunt the clinging mussel for food,"
2020,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Or bathe with the small people,"
2021,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I went before her every step
2022,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And always my feet were feeling, searching,"
2023,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For any sign of the sands of treachery.
2024,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"In my heart I said: ""They shall not have her,"
2025,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The ravenous Monster mouths,"
2026,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"They shall not have her, the pitiless death sands!"""
2027,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2028,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest, Medicine Man,"
2029,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The season of the great pow-wow
2030,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When I was needed at the fires roasting deer meat,"
2031,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,When I was needed to set the forest of wigwams
2032,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"For seven tribes, seeking our welcome,"
2033,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When I was needed to make swift preparation,"
2034,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To use all the store of my knowledge,"
2035,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,For the coming of a cloud of peoples
2036,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"From far countries to our village,"
2037,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To teach us of their experience
2038,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And to learn of our wisdom from us,"
2039,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest that day, Medicine Man--"
2040,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The greatest day of the life of our nation.
2041,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2042,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,I held little Dove Eye tight
2043,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Then set her on the pony of Star Face before him
2044,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That she might ride to meet the friendly people.
2045,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest how she danced to him,"
2046,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And beat her little hands in triumph,"
2047,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,How she snatched at the sunbeams
2048,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And fluttered her fingers to me,"
2049,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Like the flying painted wings
2050,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Honey gathering over the valley pastures;
2051,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"How she made me the sign of birds far flying,"
2052,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When she rode away at the head of our Braves,"
2053,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,On the proud pony of Star Face.
2054,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2055,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest how again and again, harshly,"
2056,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I made the sign of full cradling arms,"
2057,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Of tight holding, of unsleeping spying,"
2058,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To Star Face as he left me.
2059,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2060,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All day the fire bird burned my heart
2061,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,All day I heard his prison song;
2062,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"I stopped work at the smoking baking stones,"
2063,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To push back the hated water flowers
2064,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Like fulling wool from the wild sheep's back.
2065,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Ever I pleadingly prayed the Great Spirit
2066,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,To have her in his safe keeping.
2067,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2068,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And thou knowest how the mighty Chiefs
2069,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Rode with bowed, sorrowing heads before me."
2070,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest how Star Face, my man,"
2071,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Stood stricken and mourning at our doorway,"
2072,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,His empty hands turned down in sign of torture.
2073,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2074,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thou knowest the tale the old wise man made
2075,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Of how her glad voice chanted with the birds
2076,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And her little hands clamoured and begged,"
2077,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"When they passed the white flowered still pool,"
2078,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The magic ornament of the valley breast,"
2079,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Where first she saw the flowers of dawn growing.
2080,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Thou knowest how she whimpered,"
2081,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"How she reached pleading hungry hands,"
2082,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,How she fought to be put down to pick them.
2083,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2084,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"On his pony, Star-Face left her with the Braves,"
2085,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"While he made the welcome sign talk to the visitors,"
2086,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"While he spoke the brothers' friendly greeting,"
2087,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,While he smoked the contented peace pipe
2088,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That warmed the hearts of our visitors.
2089,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thou knowest how she turned his war pony
2090,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"And flew back over the trail, wind driven."
2091,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Thou knowest how the frightened hunters
2092,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Rode at racing speed to catch her,"
2093,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And how they saw only one little hand
2094,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Not yet swallowed by the sand mouths
2095,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"The living sign of coming mourning,"
2096,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Tightly clutching the white flower of destruction
2097,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,With its lying heart of the gold of happiness.
2098,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2099,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,And thou knowest how three of our young Braves
2100,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Went down in the fierce sand mouths,"
2101,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Fighting with full man strength to save her,"
2102,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Until the mighty Chief, her grandfather, cried:"
2103,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"""It is enough. The Great Spirit has spoken."
2104,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,He has taken her back to the land of short shadows.
2105,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"We cannot have her. I have said it!"""
2106,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2107,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
2108,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Is there no magic in the toluache lily?
2109,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Is there no medicine in thy heaped storehouse,"
2110,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Fat with all the harvest of field and forest,"
2111,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That will quench the flaming fire bird,"
2112,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That will ease its coal hot scorching?
2113,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,
2114,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Medicine Man, O Medicine Man,"
2115,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Is there no magic granted by the Great Spirit
2116,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That will take from my tortured hands
2117,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,This curse of snowy sweetness?
2118,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,Call Coüy-oüy and ask if she has finished.
2119,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Tell her she has taken my all, my last little fatling,"
2120,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"Ask her, O Medicine Man, ask her in mercy"
2121,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"To send you High Magic from the Spirits,"
2122,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,"That will empty my hands of the white flower,"
2123,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,That will ease from my sickened heart
2124,YIADA'S FLIGHT TO THE MANDANAS,The gnawing flame of the Fire Bird.
