218,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
219,INTRODUCTION,
220,INTRODUCTION,"If we define poetry as the heart of man expressed in beautiful language,"
221,INTRODUCTION,"we shall not say that we have no national poetry.  True, America has"
222,INTRODUCTION,"produced no Shakespeare and no Milton, but we have an inheritance in all"
223,INTRODUCTION,English literature; and many poets in America have followed in the
224,INTRODUCTION,footsteps of their literary British forefathers.
225,INTRODUCTION,
226,INTRODUCTION,"Puritan life was severe.  It was warfare, and manual labor of a most"
227,INTRODUCTION,"exhausting type, and loneliness, and devotion to a strict sense of duty."
228,INTRODUCTION,It was a life in which pleasure was given the least place and duty the
229,INTRODUCTION,"greatest.  Our Puritan ancestors thought music and poetry dangerous,"
230,INTRODUCTION,"if not actually sinful, because they made men think of this world rather"
231,INTRODUCTION,than of heaven.  When Anne Bradstreet wrote our first known American
232,INTRODUCTION,"poems, she was expressing English thought; ""The tenth muse"" was not"
233,INTRODUCTION,"animated by the life around her, but was living in a dream of the land"
234,INTRODUCTION,she had left behind; her poems are faint echoes of the poetry of England.
235,INTRODUCTION,"After time had identified her with life in the new world, she wrote"
236,INTRODUCTION,"""Contemplations,"" in which her English nightingales are changed to"
237,INTRODUCTION,crickets and her English gilli-flowers to American blackberry vines.
238,INTRODUCTION,The truly representative poetry of  colonial times is Michael
239,INTRODUCTION,"Wigglesworth's ""Day of Doom"".  This is the real heart of the Puritan,"
240,INTRODUCTION,"his conscience, in imperfect rhyme.  It fulfills the first part of our"
241,INTRODUCTION,"definition, but shows by its lack of beautiful style that both elements"
242,INTRODUCTION,are necessary to produce real poetry.
243,INTRODUCTION,
244,INTRODUCTION,Philip Freneau was the first American who sought to express his life in
245,INTRODUCTION,poetry.  The test of beauty of language again excludes from real poetry
246,INTRODUCTION,"some of his expressions and leaves us a few beautiful lyrics, such as"
247,INTRODUCTION,"""The Wild Honeysuckle,"" in which the poet sings his love of American"
248,INTRODUCTION,nature.  With them American poetry may be said to begin.
249,INTRODUCTION,
250,INTRODUCTION,The fast historical event of national importance was the American
251,INTRODUCTION,"Revolution.  Amid the bitter years of want, of suffering, and of war; few"
252,INTRODUCTION,men tried to write anything beautiful.  Life was harsh and stirring and
253,INTRODUCTION,this note was echoed in all the literature.  As a result we have
254,INTRODUCTION,"narrative and political poetry, such as ""The Battle of the Kegs"" and ""A"
255,INTRODUCTION,"Fable,"" dealing almost entirely with events and aiming to arouse military"
256,INTRODUCTION,"ardor.  In ""The Ballad of Nathan Hale,"" the musical expression of"
257,INTRODUCTION,"bravery, pride, and sympathy raises the poem so far above the rhymes of"
258,INTRODUCTION,their period that it will long endure as the most memorable poetic
259,INTRODUCTION,expression of the Revolutionary period.
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,"Poetry was still a thing of the moment, an avocation, not dignified by"
262,INTRODUCTION,receiving the best of a man.  With William Cullen Bryant came a change.
263,INTRODUCTION,He told our nation that in the new world as well as in the old some men
264,INTRODUCTION,should live for the beautiful.  Everything in nature spoke to him in
265,INTRODUCTION,terms of human life.  Other poets saw the relation between their own
266,INTRODUCTION,"lives and the life of the flowers and the birds, but Bryant constantly"
267,INTRODUCTION,"expressed this relationship.  The concluding stanza of ""To a Waterfowl"""
268,INTRODUCTION,"is the most perfect example of this characteristic, but it underlies also"
269,INTRODUCTION,"the whole thought of his youthful poem ""Thanatopsis"" (A View of Death)."
270,INTRODUCTION,"If we could all read the lives of our gentians and bobolinks as he did,"
271,INTRODUCTION,there would be more true poetry in America.  Modern thinkers urge us to
272,INTRODUCTION,step outside of ourselves into the lives of others and by our imagination
273,INTRODUCTION,to share their emotions; this is no new ambition in America; since Bryant
274,INTRODUCTION,"in ""The Crowded Street"" analyzes the life in the faces he sees."
275,INTRODUCTION,
276,INTRODUCTION,Until the early part of the nineteenth century American poetry dealt
277,INTRODUCTION,mainly with the facts of history and the description of nature.  A new
278,INTRODUCTION,"element of fancy is prominent in Joseph Rodman Drake's ""The Culprit Fay."""
279,INTRODUCTION,It dances through a long narrative with the delicacy of the fay himself.
280,INTRODUCTION,
281,INTRODUCTION,Edgar Allan Poe brought into our poetry somber sentiment and musical
282,INTRODUCTION,"expression.  Puritan poetry was somber, but it was almost devoid of"
283,INTRODUCTION,sentiment.  Poe loved sad beauty and meditated on the sad things in life.
284,INTRODUCTION,"Many of his poems lament the loss of some fair one.  ""To Helen,"" ""Annabel"
285,INTRODUCTION,"Lee"" ""Lenore,"" and ""To One In Paradise"" have the theme, while in ""The"
286,INTRODUCTION,"Raven"" the poet is seeking solace for the loss of Lenore.  ""Eulalie--A"
287,INTRODUCTION,"Song"" rises, on the other hand to intense happiness.  With Poe the sound"
288,INTRODUCTION,by which his idea was expressed was as important as the thought itself.
289,INTRODUCTION,"He knew how to make the sound suit the thought, as in ""The Raven"" and"
290,INTRODUCTION,"""The Bells.""  One who understands no English can grasp the meaning of the"
291,INTRODUCTION,"different sections from the mere sound, so clearly distinguishable are"
292,INTRODUCTION,the clashing of the brass and the tolling of the iron bells.  If we
293,INTRODUCTION,return to our definition of poetry as an expression of the heart of a
294,INTRODUCTION,"man, we shall find the explanation of these peculiarities: Poe was a man"
295,INTRODUCTION,of moods and possessed the ability to express these moods in appropriate
296,INTRODUCTION,sounds.
297,INTRODUCTION,
298,INTRODUCTION,The contrast between the emotion of Poe and the calm spirit of the man
299,INTRODUCTION,who followed him is very great.  In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow American
300,INTRODUCTION,"poetry reached high-water mark.  Lafcadio Hearn in his ""Interpretations"
301,INTRODUCTION,"of Literature"" says: ""Really I believe that it is a very good test of any"
302,INTRODUCTION,"Englishman's ability to feel poetry, simply to ask him, 'Did you like"
303,INTRODUCTION,"Longfellow when you were a boy?'  If he eats 'No,' then it is no use to"
304,INTRODUCTION,"talk to him on the subject of poetry at all, however much he might be"
305,INTRODUCTION,"able to tell you about quantities and metres.""  No American has in equal"
306,INTRODUCTION,"degree won the name of ""household poet.""  If this term is correctly"
307,INTRODUCTION,"understood, it sums up his merits more succinctly than can any other"
308,INTRODUCTION,title.
309,INTRODUCTION,
310,INTRODUCTION,Longfellow dealt largely with men and women and the emotions common to us
311,INTRODUCTION,"all.  Hiawatha conquering the deer and bison, and hunting in despair for"
312,INTRODUCTION,food where only snow and ice abound; Evangeline faithful to her father
313,INTRODUCTION,"and her lover, and relieving suffering in the rude hospitals of a new"
314,INTRODUCTION,world; John Alden fighting the battle between love and duty; Robert of
315,INTRODUCTION,Sicily learning the lesson of humility; Sir Federigo offering his last
316,INTRODUCTION,possession to the woman he loved; Paul Revere serving his country in time
317,INTRODUCTION,of need; the monk proving that only a sense of duty done can bring
318,INTRODUCTION,happiness: all these and more express the emotions which we know are true
319,INTRODUCTION,in our own lives.  In his longer narrative poems he makes the legends of
320,INTRODUCTION,Puritan life real to us; he takes English folk-lore and makes us see
321,INTRODUCTION,"Othere talking to Arthur, and the Viking stealing his bride.  His short"
322,INTRODUCTION,poems are even better known than his longer narratives.  In them he
323,INTRODUCTION,"expressed his gentle, sincere love of the young, the suffering, and the"
324,INTRODUCTION,sorrowful.  In the Sonnets he showed; that deep appreciation of European
325,INTRODUCTION,literature which made noteworthy his teaching at Harvard and his
326,INTRODUCTION,translations.
327,INTRODUCTION,
328,INTRODUCTION,He believed that he was assigned a definite task in the world which he
329,INTRODUCTION,described as follows in his last poem:
330,INTRODUCTION,
331,INTRODUCTION,"""As comes the smile to the lips,"
332,INTRODUCTION,The foam to the surge;
333,INTRODUCTION,
334,INTRODUCTION,"So come to the Poet his songs,"
335,INTRODUCTION,All hitherward blown
336,INTRODUCTION,"From the misty realm, that belongs"
337,INTRODUCTION,To the vast unknown.
338,INTRODUCTION,
339,INTRODUCTION,"His, and not his, are the lays"
340,INTRODUCTION,He sings; and their fame
341,INTRODUCTION,"Is his, and not his; and the praise"
342,INTRODUCTION,And the pride of a name.
343,INTRODUCTION,
344,INTRODUCTION,For voices pursue him by day
345,INTRODUCTION,"And haunt him by night,"
346,INTRODUCTION,"And he listens and needs must obey,"
347,INTRODUCTION,When the Angel says: 'Write!'
348,INTRODUCTION,
349,INTRODUCTION,John Greenleaf Whittier seems to suffer by coming in such close proximity
350,INTRODUCTION,"to Longfellow.  Genuine he was, but his spirit was less buoyant than"
351,INTRODUCTION,Longfellow's and he touches our hearts less.  Most of his early poems
352,INTRODUCTION,were devoted to a current political issue.  They aimed to win converts to
353,INTRODUCTION,the cause of anti-slavery.  Such poems always suffer in time in
354,INTRODUCTION,"comparison with the song of a man who sings because ""the heart is so full"
355,INTRODUCTION,"that a drop overfills it.""  Whittier's later poems belong more to this"
356,INTRODUCTION,class and some of them speak to-day to our emotions as well as to our
357,INTRODUCTION,"intellects.  ""The Hero"" moves us with a desire to serve mankind, and the"
358,INTRODUCTION,"stirring tone of ""Barbara Frietchie"" arouses our patriotism by its"
359,INTRODUCTION,"picture of the same type of bravery.  In similar vein is ""Barclay of"
360,INTRODUCTION,"Ury,"" which must have touched deeply the heart of the Quaker poet.  ""The"
361,INTRODUCTION,"Pipes of Lucknow"" is dramatic in its intense grasp of a climactic hour"
362,INTRODUCTION,and loses none of its force in the expression.  We can actually hear the
363,INTRODUCTION,skirl of the bagpipes.  Whittier knew the artiste of the world and talked
364,INTRODUCTION,"to us about Raphael and Burns with clear-sighted, affectionate interest."
365,INTRODUCTION,His poems show varied characteristics; the love of the sterner aspects of
366,INTRODUCTION,"nature, modified by the appreciation of the humble flower; the conscience"
367,INTRODUCTION,"of the Puritan, tinged with sympathy for the sorrowful; the steadfastness"
368,INTRODUCTION,"of the Quaker, stirred by the fire of the patriot."
369,INTRODUCTION,
370,INTRODUCTION,The poetry of Ralph Waldo Emerson is marked by serious contemplation
371,INTRODUCTION,rather than by warmth of emotional expression.  In Longfellow the appeal
372,INTRODUCTION,is constantly to a heart which is not disassociated from a brain; in
373,INTRODUCTION,Emerson the appeal is often to the intellect alone.  We recognize the
374,INTRODUCTION,"force of the lesson in ""The Titmouse,"" even if it leaves us less devoted"
375,INTRODUCTION,"citizens than does ""The Hero"" and less capable women than does"
376,INTRODUCTION,"""Evangeline.""  He reaches his highest excellence when he makes us feel as"
377,INTRODUCTION,"well as understand a lesson, as in ""The Concord Hymn"" and ""Forbearance."""
378,INTRODUCTION,"If we could all write on the tablets of our hearts that single stanza,"
379,INTRODUCTION,forbearance would be a real factor in life.  And it is to this poet whom
380,INTRODUCTION,we call unemotional that we owe this inspiring quatrain:
381,INTRODUCTION,
382,INTRODUCTION,"""So nigh is grandeur to our dust,"
383,INTRODUCTION,"So near is God to man,"
384,INTRODUCTION,"When duty whispers low, Thou must,"
385,INTRODUCTION,"The youth replies, I can!"""
386,INTRODUCTION,
387,INTRODUCTION,James Russell Lowell was animated by a well-defined purpose which he
388,INTRODUCTION,described in the following lines:
389,INTRODUCTION,
390,INTRODUCTION,"""It may be glorious to write"
391,INTRODUCTION,Thoughts that make glad the two or three
392,INTRODUCTION,High souls like those far stars that come in sight
393,INTRODUCTION,Once in a century.
394,INTRODUCTION,
395,INTRODUCTION,But better far it is to speak
396,INTRODUCTION,"One simple word which, now and then"
397,INTRODUCTION,Shall waken their free nature in the weak
398,INTRODUCTION,And friendless sons of men.
399,INTRODUCTION,
400,INTRODUCTION,To write some earnest verse or line
401,INTRODUCTION,"Which, seeking not the praise of art,"
402,INTRODUCTION,
403,INTRODUCTION,Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine
404,INTRODUCTION,"In the untutored heart."""
405,INTRODUCTION,
406,INTRODUCTION,"His very accomplishments made it difficult for him to reach this aim,"
407,INTRODUCTION,"since his poetry does not move ""the untutored heart"" so readily as does"
408,INTRODUCTION,"that of Longfellow or Whittier.  It is, on the whole, too deeply burdened"
409,INTRODUCTION,with learning and too individual in expression to fulfil his highest
410,INTRODUCTION,"desire.  Of his early poems the most generally known is probably ""The"
411,INTRODUCTION,"Vision of Sir Launfal,"" in which a strong moral purpose is combined with"
412,INTRODUCTION,lines of beautiful nature description:
413,INTRODUCTION,
414,INTRODUCTION,"""And what is so rare as a day in June?"
415,INTRODUCTION,"Then, if ever, come perfect days."
416,INTRODUCTION,
417,INTRODUCTION,Two works by which he will be permanently remembered show a deeper and
418,INTRODUCTION,"more effective Lowell.  ""The Biglow Papers"" are the most successful of"
419,INTRODUCTION,all the American poems which attempt to improve conditions by means of
420,INTRODUCTION,humor.  Although they refer in the main to the situation at the time of
421,INTRODUCTION,"the Mexican War, they deal with such universal political traits that they"
422,INTRODUCTION,may be applied to almost any age.  They are written in a Yankee dialect
423,INTRODUCTION,"which, it is asserted, was never spoken, but which enhances the humor, as"
424,INTRODUCTION,"in ""What Mr. Robinson Thinks.""  Lowell's tribute to Lincoln occurs in the"
425,INTRODUCTION,Ode which he wrote to commemorate the Harvard students who enlisted in
426,INTRODUCTION,the Civil War.  After dwelling on the search for truth which should be
427,INTRODUCTION,"the aim of every college student, he turns to the delineation of"
428,INTRODUCTION,"Lincoln's character in a eulogy of great beauty.  Clear in analysis,"
429,INTRODUCTION,"far-sighted in judgment, and loving in sentiment, he expresses that"
430,INTRODUCTION,opinion of Lincoln which has become a part of the web of American
431,INTRODUCTION,"thought.  His is no hurried judgment, but the calm statement of opinion"
432,INTRODUCTION,which is to-day accepted by the world:
433,INTRODUCTION,
434,INTRODUCTION,"""They all are gone, and, standing like a tower,"
435,INTRODUCTION,"Our children shall behold his fame,"
436,INTRODUCTION,"The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man,"
437,INTRODUCTION,"Sagacious, patient, dreading, praise, not blame,"
438,INTRODUCTION,"Now birth of our new soil, the first American."""
439,INTRODUCTION,
440,INTRODUCTION,With Oliver Wendell Holmes comes the last of this brief American list of
441,INTRODUCTION,honor.  No other American has so combined delicacy with the New England
442,INTRODUCTION,"humor.  We should be poorer by many a smile without ""My Aunt"" and ""The"
443,INTRODUCTION,"Deacon's Masterpiece.""  But this is not his entire gift.  ""The Chambered"
444,INTRODUCTION,"Nautilus"" strikes the chord of noble sentiment sounded in the last stanza"

1280,THANATOPSIS,"Communion with her visible forms, she speaks"

1282,THANATOPSIS,"She has a voice of gladness, and a smile"

1284,THANATOPSIS,"Into his darker musings, with a mild"
1285,THANATOPSIS,"And healing sympathy, that steals away"

1287,THANATOPSIS,Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
1288,THANATOPSIS,"Over thy spirit, and sad images"
1289,THANATOPSIS,"Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,"
1290,THANATOPSIS,"And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,"
1291,THANATOPSIS,Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart;--
1292,THANATOPSIS,"Go forth, under the open sky, and list"
1293,THANATOPSIS,"To Nature's teachings, while from all around--"
1294,THANATOPSIS,"Earth and her waters, and the depths of air--"
1295,THANATOPSIS,Comes a still voice:--
1296,THANATOPSIS,
1297,THANATOPSIS,"Yet a few days, and thee"
1298,THANATOPSIS,The all-beholding sun shall see no more
1299,THANATOPSIS,In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground
1300,THANATOPSIS,"Where thy pale form was laid with many tears,"
1301,THANATOPSIS,"Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist"
1302,THANATOPSIS,"Thy image.  Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim"
1303,THANATOPSIS,"Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,"
1304,THANATOPSIS,"And, lost each human trace, surrendering up"
1305,THANATOPSIS,"Thine individual being, shalt thou go"
1306,THANATOPSIS,"To mix forever with the elements,"
1307,THANATOPSIS,To be a brother to the insensible rock
1308,THANATOPSIS,"And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain"

1311,THANATOPSIS,
1312,THANATOPSIS,Yet not to thine eternal resting place
1313,THANATOPSIS,"Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish"

1315,THANATOPSIS,"With patriarchs of the infant world--with kings,"
1316,THANATOPSIS,"The powerful of the earth--the wise, the good,"
1317,THANATOPSIS,"Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,"
1318,THANATOPSIS,All in one mighty sepulchre.  The hills

1329,THANATOPSIS,Through the still lapse of ages.  All that tread
1330,THANATOPSIS,The globe are but a handful to the tribes
1331,THANATOPSIS,That slumber in its bosom.--Take the wings
1332,THANATOPSIS,"Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,"
1333,THANATOPSIS,
1334,THANATOPSIS,Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
1335,THANATOPSIS,"Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,"
1336,THANATOPSIS,Save his own dashing--yet the dead are there;

1340,THANATOPSIS,"So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw"
1341,THANATOPSIS,"In silence from the living, and no friend"
1342,THANATOPSIS,Take note of thy departure?  All that breathe
1343,THANATOPSIS,Will share thy destiny.  The gay will laugh

1348,THANATOPSIS,And make their bed with thee.  As the long train
1349,THANATOPSIS,"Of ages glides away, the sons of men--"
1350,THANATOPSIS,"The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes"
1351,THANATOPSIS,"In the full strength of years, matron and maid,"

1471,GREEN RIVER,"With colored pebbles and sparkles of light,"
1472,GREEN RIVER,"And clear the depths where its eddies play,"
1473,GREEN RIVER,"And dimples deepen and whirl away,"

1510,GREEN RIVER,"While o'er them the vine to its thicket clings,"
1511,GREEN RIVER,"And the zephyr stoops to freshen his wings,"
1512,GREEN RIVER,But I wish that fate had left me free
1513,GREEN RIVER,"To wander these quiet haunts with thee,"
1514,GREEN RIVER,"Till the eating cares of earth should depart,"
1515,GREEN RIVER,And the peace of the scene pass into my heart;
1516,GREEN RIVER,"And I envy thy stream, as it glides along"

1518,GREEN RIVER,
1519,GREEN RIVER,"Though forced to drudge for the dregs of men,"
1520,GREEN RIVER,"And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen,"
1521,GREEN RIVER,"And mingle among the jostling crowd,"
1522,GREEN RIVER,Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud--
1523,GREEN RIVER,"I often come to this quiet place,"
1524,GREEN RIVER,"To breathe the airs that ruffle thy face,"
1525,GREEN RIVER,"And gaze upon thee in silent dream,"

1650,A FOREST HYMN,"From perch to perch, the solitary bird"
1651,A FOREST HYMN,"Passes; and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs"
1652,A FOREST HYMN,Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots
1653,A FOREST HYMN,"Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale"
1654,A FOREST HYMN,Of all the good it does.  Thou halt not left
1655,A FOREST HYMN,"Thyself without a witness, in the shades,"
1656,A FOREST HYMN,"Of thy perfections.  Grandeur, strength, and grace"
1657,A FOREST HYMN,Are here to speak of thee.  This mighty oak
1658,A FOREST HYMN,By whose immovable stem I stand and seem
1659,A FOREST HYMN,"Almost annihilated--not a prince,"
1660,A FOREST HYMN,"In all that proud old world beyond the deep,"
1661,A FOREST HYMN,E'er wore his crown as loftily as he
1662,A FOREST HYMN,Wears the green coronal of leaves with which
1663,A FOREST HYMN,Thy hand has graced him.  Nestled at his root
1664,A FOREST HYMN,"Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare"
1665,A FOREST HYMN,"Of the broad sun.  That delicate forest flower,"
1666,A FOREST HYMN,"With scented breath and look so like a smile,"
1667,A FOREST HYMN,"Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould,"
1668,A FOREST HYMN,"Au emanation of the indwelling Life,"
1669,A FOREST HYMN,"A visible token of the upholding Love,"
1670,A FOREST HYMN,That are the soul of this great universe.
1671,A FOREST HYMN,
1672,A FOREST HYMN,My heart is awed within me when I think
1673,A FOREST HYMN,"Of the great miracle that still goes on,"
1674,A FOREST HYMN,"In silence, round me--the perpetual work"
1675,A FOREST HYMN,"Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed"
1676,A FOREST HYMN,Forever.  Written on thy works I read
1677,A FOREST HYMN,The lesson of thy own eternity.
1678,A FOREST HYMN,"Lo! all grow old and die--but see again,"
1679,A FOREST HYMN,How on the faltering footsteps of decay
1680,A FOREST HYMN,Youth presses--ever gay and beautiful youth
1681,A FOREST HYMN,In all its beautiful forms.  These lofty trees
1682,A FOREST HYMN,Wave not less proudly that their ancestors
1683,A FOREST HYMN,"Moulder beneath them.  Oh, there is not lost"
1684,A FOREST HYMN,"One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet,"
1685,A FOREST HYMN,"After the flight of untold centuries,"
1686,A FOREST HYMN,The freshness of her far beginning lies
1687,A FOREST HYMN,And yet shall lie.  Life mocks the idle hate
1688,A FOREST HYMN,"Of his arch-enemy Death--yea, seats himself"
1689,A FOREST HYMN,"Upon the tyrant's throne--the sepulchre,"
1690,A FOREST HYMN,And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe
1691,A FOREST HYMN,Makes his own nourishment.  For he came forth
1692,A FOREST HYMN,"From thine own bosom, and shall have no end."
1693,A FOREST HYMN,
1694,A FOREST HYMN,There have been holy men who hid themselves
1695,A FOREST HYMN,"Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave"
1696,A FOREST HYMN,"Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived"
1697,A FOREST HYMN,"The generation born with them, nor seemed"
1698,A FOREST HYMN,Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks
1699,A FOREST HYMN,Around them;--and there have been holy men
1700,A FOREST HYMN,Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.
1701,A FOREST HYMN,But let me often to these solitudes
1702,A FOREST HYMN,"Retire, and in thy presence reassure"
1703,A FOREST HYMN,"My feeble virtue.  Here its enemies,"
1704,A FOREST HYMN,"The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink"
1705,A FOREST HYMN,And tremble and are still.  O God! when thou
1706,A FOREST HYMN,"Dost scare the world with tempest, set on fire"
1707,A FOREST HYMN,"The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill,"
1708,A FOREST HYMN,"With all the waters of the firmament,"
1709,A FOREST HYMN,The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods
1710,A FOREST HYMN,"And drowns the villages; when, at thy call,"
1711,A FOREST HYMN,Uprises the great deep and throws himself
1712,A FOREST HYMN,"Upon the continent, and overwhelms"
1713,A FOREST HYMN,"Its cities--who forgets not, at the sight"
1714,A FOREST HYMN,"Of these tremendous tokens of thy power,"
1715,A FOREST HYMN,"His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by?"
1716,A FOREST HYMN,"Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face"
1717,A FOREST HYMN,"Spare me and mine, nor let us need the wrath"
1718,A FOREST HYMN,Of the mad unchained elements to teach
1719,A FOREST HYMN,"Who rules them.  Be it ours to meditate,"
1720,A FOREST HYMN,"In these calm shades, thy milder majesty,"
1721,A FOREST HYMN,And to the beautiful order of thy works
1722,A FOREST HYMN,Learn to conform the order of our lives.

2434,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Thou shaft watch the oozy brine
2435,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine;
2436,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then dart the glistening arch below,"
2437,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And catch a drop from his silver bow.
2438,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The water-sprites will wield their arms,"
2439,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And dash around with roar and rave;
2440,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And vain are the woodland spirits' charms--
2441,THE AMERICAN FLAG,They are the imps that rule the wave.
2442,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Yet trust thee in thy single might:
2443,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right,"
2444,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Thou shalt win the warlock fight."" . . ."
2445,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2446,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The goblin marked his monarch well;
2447,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He spake not, but he bowed him low;"
2448,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then plucked a crimson colen-bell,"
2449,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And turned him round in act to go.
2450,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The way is long, he cannot fly,"
2451,THE AMERICAN FLAG,His soiled wing has lost its power;
2452,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And he winds adown the mountain high
2453,THE AMERICAN FLAG,For many a sore and weary hour
2454,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Through dreary beds of tangled fern,"
2455,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Through groves of nightshade dark and dern,"
2456,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Over the grass and through the brake,"
2457,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake;
2458,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Now over the violet's azure flush
2459,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He skips along in lightsome mood;
2460,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And now he thrids the bramble-bush,"
2461,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till its points are dyed in fairy blood;
2462,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He has leaped the bog, he has pierced the brier,"
2463,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He has swum the brook, and waded the mire,"
2464,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Till his spirits sank and his limbs grew weak,"
2465,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the red waxed fainter in his cheek.
2466,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He had fallen to the ground outright,"
2467,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"For rugged and dim was his onward track,"
2468,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But there came a spotted toad in sight,"
2469,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And he laughed as he jumped upon her back;
2470,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He bridled her mouth with a silkweed twist,"
2471,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He lashed her sides with an osier thong;
2472,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And now through evening's dewy mist
2473,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"With leap and spring they bound along,"
2474,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Till the mountain's magic verge is past,"
2475,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the beach of sand is reached at last.
2476,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2477,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Soft and pale is the moony beam,"
2478,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Moveless still the glassy stream;
2479,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The wave is clear, the beach is bright"
2480,THE AMERICAN FLAG,With snowy shells and sparkling stones;
2481,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The shore-surge comes in ripples light,"
2482,THE AMERICAN FLAG,In murmurings faint and distant moans;
2483,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And ever afar in the silence deep
2484,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Is heard the splash of the sturgeon's leap,"
2485,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the bend of his graceful bow is seen--
2486,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"A glittering arch of silver sheen,"
2487,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Spanning the wave of burnished blue,"
2488,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And dripping with gems of the river-dew.
2489,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2490,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The elfin cast a glance around,"
2491,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"As he lighted down from his courser toad,"
2492,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then round his breast his wings he wound,"
2493,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And close to the river's brink he strode;
2494,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He sprang on a rock, he breathed a prayer,"
2495,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Above his head his arms he threw,"
2496,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then tossed a tiny curve in air,"
2497,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And headlong plunged in the waters blue.
2498,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2499,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Up sprung the spirits of the waves,"
2500,THE AMERICAN FLAG,from the sea-silk beds in their coral caves;
2501,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"With snail-plate armor snatched in haste,"
2502,THE AMERICAN FLAG,They speed their way through the liquid waste.
2503,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Some are rapidly borne along
2504,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"On the mailed shrimp or the prickly prong,"
2505,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Some on the blood-red leeches glide,"
2506,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Some on the stony star-fish ride,"
2507,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Some on the back of the lancing squab,"
2508,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Some on the sideling soldier-crab,"
2509,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And some on the jellied quarl that flings
2510,THE AMERICAN FLAG,At once a thousand streamy stings.
2511,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"They cut the wave with the living oar,"
2512,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And hurry on to the moonlight shore,"
2513,THE AMERICAN FLAG,To guard their realms and chase away
2514,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The footsteps of the invading Fay.
2515,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2516,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Fearlessly he skims along;
2517,THE AMERICAN FLAG,His hope is high and his limbs are strong;
2518,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He spreads his arms like the swallow's wing,"
2519,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And throws his feet with a frog-like fling;
2520,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"His locks of gold on the waters shine,"
2521,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"At his breast the tiny foam-beads rise,"
2522,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"His back gleams bright above the brine,"
2523,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the wake-line foam behind him lies.
2524,THE AMERICAN FLAG,But the water-sprites are gathering near
2525,THE AMERICAN FLAG,To check his course along the tide;
2526,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Their warriors come in swift career
2527,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And hem him round on every side:
2528,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"On his thigh the leech has fixed his hold,"
2529,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The quad's long arms are round him rolled,"
2530,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The prickly prong has pierced his skin,"
2531,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And the squab has thrown his javelin,"
2532,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The gritty star has rubbed him raw,"
2533,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the crab has struck with his giant claw.
2534,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He howls with rage, and he shrieks with pain;"
2535,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He strikes around, but his blows are vain;"
2536,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Hopeless is the unequal fight
2537,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Fairy, naught is left but flight."
2538,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2539,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He turned him round and fled amain,"
2540,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"With hurry and dash, to the beach again;"
2541,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He twisted over from side to side,"
2542,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And laid his cheek to the cleaving tide;
2543,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The strokes of his plunging arms are fleet,"
2544,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And with all his might he flings his feet.
2545,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But the water-sprites are round him still,"
2546,THE AMERICAN FLAG,To cross his path and work him ill:
2547,THE AMERICAN FLAG,They bade the wave before him rise;
2548,THE AMERICAN FLAG,They flung the sea-fire in his eyes;
2549,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And they stunned his ears with the scallop-stroke,"
2550,THE AMERICAN FLAG,With the porpoise heave and the drum-fish croak.
2551,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Oh, but a weary wight was he"
2552,THE AMERICAN FLAG,When he reached the foot of the dog-wood tree.
2553,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Gashed and wounded, and stiff and sore,"
2554,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He laid him down on the sandy shore;
2555,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He blessed the force of the charmed line,"
2556,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And he banned the water-goblins spite,"
2557,THE AMERICAN FLAG,For he saw around in the sweet moonshine
2558,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Their little wee faces above the brine,"
2559,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Giggling and laughing with all their might
2560,THE AMERICAN FLAG,At the piteous hap of the Fairy wight.
2561,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2562,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Soon he gathered the balsam dew
2563,THE AMERICAN FLAG,From the sorrel-leaf and the henbane bud;
2564,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Over each wound the balm he drew,"
2565,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And with cobweb lint he stanched the blood.
2566,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The mild west wind was soft and low;
2567,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"It cooled the heat of his burning brow,"
2568,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And he felt new life in his sinews shoot
2569,THE AMERICAN FLAG,As he drank the juice of the calamus root.
2570,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And now he treads the fatal shore
2571,THE AMERICAN FLAG,As fresh and vigorous as before.
2572,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2573,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Wrapped in musing stands the sprite
2574,THE AMERICAN FLAG,'Tis the middle wane of night;
2575,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"His task is hard, his way is far,"
2576,THE AMERICAN FLAG,But he must do his errand right
2577,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Ere dawning mounts her beamy car,"
2578,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And rolls her chariot wheels of light;
2579,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And vain are the spells of fairy-land,"
2580,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He must work with a human hand.
2581,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2582,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He cast a saddened look around;
2583,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But he felt new joy his bosom swell,"
2584,THE AMERICAN FLAG,When glittering on the shadowed ground
2585,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He saw a purple mussel-shell;
2586,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Thither he ran, and he bent him low,"
2587,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He heaved at the stern and he heaved at the bow,"
2588,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And he pushed her over the yielding sand
2589,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till he came; to the verge of the haunted land.
2590,THE AMERICAN FLAG,She was as lovely a pleasure-boat
2591,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"As ever fairy had paddled in,"
2592,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"For she glowed with purple paint without,"
2593,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And shone with silvery pearl within
2594,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"A sculler's notch in the stern he made,"
2595,THE AMERICAN FLAG,An oar he shaped of the bootle-blade;
2596,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then sprung to his seat with a lightsome leap,"
2597,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And launched afar on the calm, blue deep."
2598,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2599,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The imps of the river yell and rave
2600,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"They had no power above the wave,"
2601,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But they heaved the billow before the prow,"
2602,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And they dashed the surge against her side,"
2603,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And they struck her keel with jerk and blow,"
2604,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till the gunwale bent to the rocking tide.
2605,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"She wimpled about to the pale moonbeam,"
2606,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Like a feather that floats on a wind-tossed stream;
2607,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And momently athwart her track
2608,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"The quad upreared his island back,"
2609,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And the fluttering scallop behind would float,"
2610,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And patter the water about the boat;
2611,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But he bailed her out with his colon-bell,"
2612,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And he kept her trimmed with a wary tread,"
2613,THE AMERICAN FLAG,While on every side like lightning fell
2614,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The heavy strokes of his Bootle-blade.
2615,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2616,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Onward still he held his way,"
2617,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Till he came where the column of moonshine lay,"
2618,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And saw beneath the surface dim
2619,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The brown-backed sturgeon slowly swim.
2620,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Around him were the goblin train;
2621,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But he sculled with all his might and main,"
2622,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And followed wherever the sturgeon led,"
2623,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till he saw him upward point his head;
2624,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"""Mien he dropped his paddle-blade,"
2625,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And held his colen-goblet up
2626,THE AMERICAN FLAG,To catch the drop in its crimson cup.
2627,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2628,THE AMERICAN FLAG,With sweeping tail and quivering fin
2629,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Through the wave the sturgeon flew,"
2630,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And like the heaven-shot javelin
2631,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He sprung above the waters blue.
2632,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Instant as the star-fall light,"
2633,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He plunged him in the deep again,"
2634,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"But left an arch of silver bright,"
2635,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The rainbow of the moony main.
2636,THE AMERICAN FLAG,It was a strange and lovely sight
2637,THE AMERICAN FLAG,To see the puny goblin there:
2638,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He seemed an angel form of light,"
2639,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"With azure wing and sunny hair,"
2640,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Throned on a cloud of purple fair,"
2641,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Circled with blue and edged with white,"
2642,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And sitting at the fall of even
2643,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Beneath the bow of summer heaven.
2644,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2645,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"A moment, and its lustre fell;"
2646,THE AMERICAN FLAG,But ere it met the billow blue
2647,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He caught within his crimson bell
2648,THE AMERICAN FLAG,A droplet of its sparkling dew.
2649,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Joy to thee, Fay! thy task is done;"
2650,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Thy wings are pure, for the gem is won."
2651,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Cheerly ply thy dripping oar,"
2652,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And haste away to the elfin shore!
2653,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2654,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"He turns, and to on either side"
2655,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The ripples on his path divide;
2656,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And the track o'er which his boat must pass
2657,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass.
2658,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Around, their limbs the sea-nymphs lave,"
2659,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"With snowy arms half swelling out,"
2660,THE AMERICAN FLAG,While on the glossed and gleamy wave
2661,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Their sea-green ringlets loosely float:
2662,THE AMERICAN FLAG,They swim around with smile and song;
2663,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"They press the bark with pearly hand,"
2664,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And gently urge her course along,"
2665,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Toward the beach of speckled sand;
2666,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And as he lightly leaped to land
2667,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"They bade adieu with nod and bow,"
2668,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then gaily kissed each little hand,"
2669,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And dropped in the crystal deep below.
2670,THE AMERICAN FLAG,
2671,THE AMERICAN FLAG,A moment stayed the fairy there:
2672,THE AMERICAN FLAG,He kissed the beach and breathed a prayer;
2673,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Then spread his wings of gilded blue,"
2674,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And on to the elfin court he flew.
2675,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"As ever ye saw a bubble rise,"
2676,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"And shine with a thousand changing dyes,"
2677,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"Till, lessening far, through ether driven,"
2678,THE AMERICAN FLAG,It mingles with the hues of heaven;
2679,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"As, at the glimpse of morning pale,"
2680,THE AMERICAN FLAG,The lance-fly spreads his silken sail
2681,THE AMERICAN FLAG,And gleams with bleedings soft and bright
2682,THE AMERICAN FLAG,Till lost in the shades of fading night;
2683,THE AMERICAN FLAG,"So rose from earth the lovely Fay,"
2684,THE AMERICAN FLAG,So vanished far in heaven away!

2697,MARCO BOZZARIS,The Turk was dreaming of the hour
2698,MARCO BOZZARIS,"When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,"
2699,MARCO BOZZARIS,Should tremble at his power;
2700,MARCO BOZZARIS,"In dreams, through camp and court he bore."
2701,MARCO BOZZARIS,The trophies of a conqueror;
2702,MARCO BOZZARIS,In dreams his song of triumph heard;
2703,MARCO BOZZARIS,Then wore his monarch's signet ring;
2704,MARCO BOZZARIS,Then pressed that monarch's throne--a king:
2705,MARCO BOZZARIS,As wild his thoughts and gay of wing
2706,MARCO BOZZARIS,As Eden's garden bird.
2707,MARCO BOZZARIS,
2708,MARCO BOZZARIS,"At midnight, in the forest shades,"
2709,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,"
2710,MARCO BOZZARIS,"True as the steel of their tried blades,"
2711,MARCO BOZZARIS,Heroes in heart and hand.
2712,MARCO BOZZARIS,"There had the Persian's thousands stood,"
2713,MARCO BOZZARIS,There had the glad earth drunk their blood
2714,MARCO BOZZARIS,On old Plataea's day;
2715,MARCO BOZZARIS,And now there breathed that haunted air
2716,MARCO BOZZARIS,"The sons of sires who conquered there,"
2717,MARCO BOZZARIS,"With arm to strike, and soul to dare,"
2718,MARCO BOZZARIS,"As quick, as far as they."
2719,MARCO BOZZARIS,
2720,MARCO BOZZARIS,An hour passed on--the Turk awoke;
2721,MARCO BOZZARIS,That bright dream was his last;
2722,MARCO BOZZARIS,"He woke--to hear his sentries shriek,"
2723,MARCO BOZZARIS,"""To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"""
2724,MARCO BOZZARIS,"He woke--to die midst flame and smoke,"
2725,MARCO BOZZARIS,"And shout and groan and sabre-stroke,"
2726,MARCO BOZZARIS,And death-shots falling thick and fast
2727,MARCO BOZZARIS,As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;
2728,MARCO BOZZARIS,"And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,"
2729,MARCO BOZZARIS,Bozzaris cheer his band:
2730,MARCO BOZZARIS,Strike--till the last armed foe expires!
2731,MARCO BOZZARIS,Strike--for your altars and your fires!
2732,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Strike--for the green graves of your sires,"
2733,MARCO BOZZARIS,"God, and your native land!"""
2734,MARCO BOZZARIS,
2735,MARCO BOZZARIS,"They fought like brave men, long and well;"
2736,MARCO BOZZARIS,They piled that ground with Moslem slain;
2737,MARCO BOZZARIS,"They conquered--but Bozzaris fell,"
2738,MARCO BOZZARIS,Bleeding at every vein.
2739,MARCO BOZZARIS,His few surviving comrades saw
2740,MARCO BOZZARIS,"His smile when rang their proud hurrah,"
2741,MARCO BOZZARIS,And the red field was won;
2742,MARCO BOZZARIS,Then saw in death his eyelids close
2743,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Calmly, as to a night's repose,"
2744,MARCO BOZZARIS,Like flowers at set of sun.
2745,MARCO BOZZARIS,
2746,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Come to the bridal chamber, Death!"

2763,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,"
2764,MARCO BOZZARIS,And in its hollow tones are heard
2765,MARCO BOZZARIS,The thanks of millions yet to be.
2766,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Come when his task of fame is wrought,"
2767,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Come with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought,"
2768,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Come in her crowning hour, and then"
2769,MARCO BOZZARIS,Thy sunken eye's unearthly light
2770,MARCO BOZZARIS,To him is welcome as the sight
2771,MARCO BOZZARIS,Of sky and stars to prisoned men;
2772,MARCO BOZZARIS,Thy grasp is welcome as the hand
2773,MARCO BOZZARIS,Of brother in a foreign land;

2775,MARCO BOZZARIS,That told the Indian isles were nigh
2776,MARCO BOZZARIS,"To the world-seeking Genoese,"
2777,MARCO BOZZARIS,"When the land-wind, from woods of palm"
2778,MARCO BOZZARIS,"And orange-groves and fields of balm,"
2779,MARCO BOZZARIS,Blew oer the Haytian seas.

2781,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Bozzaris, with the storied brave"
2782,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Greece nurtured in her glory's time,"
2783,MARCO BOZZARIS,Rest thee--there is no prouder gave.
2784,MARCO BOZZARIS,Even in her own proud clime.
2785,MARCO BOZZARIS,"She wore no funeral-weeds for thee,"
2786,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume,"
2787,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Like torn branch from death's leafless tree,"
2788,MARCO BOZZARIS,"In sorrow's pomp and pageantry,"
2789,MARCO BOZZARIS,The heartless luxury of the tomb.
2790,MARCO BOZZARIS,But she remembers thee as one
2791,MARCO BOZZARIS,Long loved and for a season gone;
2792,MARCO BOZZARIS,"For thee her poet's lyre is wreathed,"
2793,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Her marble wrought, her music breathed;"
2794,MARCO BOZZARIS,For thee she rings the birthday bells;
2795,MARCO BOZZARIS,Of thee her babes' first lisping tells;
2796,MARCO BOZZARIS,For throe her evening prayer is said
2797,MARCO BOZZARIS,At palace-couch and cottage-bed;
2798,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Her soldier, closing with the foe,"
2799,MARCO BOZZARIS,Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow;
2800,MARCO BOZZARIS,"His plighted maiden, when she fears"
2801,MARCO BOZZARIS,"For him, the joy of her young years,"
2802,MARCO BOZZARIS,Thinks of thy fate and checks her tears;
2803,MARCO BOZZARIS,"And she, the mother of thy boys,"
2804,MARCO BOZZARIS,Though in her eye and faded cheek
2805,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Is read the grief she will not speak,"
2806,MARCO BOZZARIS,"The memory of her buried joys,"
2807,MARCO BOZZARIS,"And even she who gave thee birth,"
2808,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth,"
2809,MARCO BOZZARIS,"Talk of thy doom without a sigh,"

3222,THE RAVEN,"""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"
3223,THE RAVEN,"But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping"
3224,THE RAVEN,"And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,"
3225,THE RAVEN,"That I scarce was sure I heard you""--here I opened wide the door;--"
3226,THE RAVEN,Darkness there and nothing more.
3227,THE RAVEN,
3228,THE RAVEN,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,"
3229,THE RAVEN,"fearing,"
3230,THE RAVEN,"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;"
3231,THE RAVEN,"But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,"
3232,THE RAVEN,"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!"""
3233,THE RAVEN,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word ""Lenore!"""
3234,THE RAVEN,Merely this and nothing more.
3235,THE RAVEN,
3236,THE RAVEN,"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
3237,THE RAVEN,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
3238,THE RAVEN,"""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;"
3239,THE RAVEN,"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--"
3240,THE RAVEN,Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
3241,THE RAVEN,"'Tis the wind and nothing more!"""
3242,THE RAVEN,
3243,THE RAVEN,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter"
3244,THE RAVEN,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
3245,THE RAVEN,Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
3246,THE RAVEN,"But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--"
3247,THE RAVEN,Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
3248,THE RAVEN,"Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
3249,THE RAVEN,
3250,THE RAVEN,"Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
3251,THE RAVEN,"By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
3252,THE RAVEN,"""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art"
3253,THE RAVEN,"sure no craven,"
3254,THE RAVEN,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
3255,THE RAVEN,"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"""
3256,THE RAVEN,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
3257,THE RAVEN,
3258,THE RAVEN,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
3259,THE RAVEN,Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
3260,THE RAVEN,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
3261,THE RAVEN,Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
3262,THE RAVEN,"Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
3263,THE RAVEN,"With such name as ""Nevermore."""
3264,THE RAVEN,
3265,THE RAVEN,"But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only"
3266,THE RAVEN,"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour."
3267,THE RAVEN,Nothing farther then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
3268,THE RAVEN,"Till I scarcely more than muttered ""Other friends have flown before--"
3269,THE RAVEN,"On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."""
3270,THE RAVEN,"Then the bird said ""Nevermore."""
3271,THE RAVEN,
3272,THE RAVEN,"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
3273,THE RAVEN,"""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,"
3274,THE RAVEN,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
3275,THE RAVEN,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
3276,THE RAVEN,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore--
3277,THE RAVEN,"Of 'Never--nevermore.'"""
3278,THE RAVEN,
3279,THE RAVEN,"But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,"
3280,THE RAVEN,"Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and"
3281,THE RAVEN,door;
3282,THE RAVEN,"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking"
3283,THE RAVEN,"Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--"
3284,THE RAVEN,"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore"
3285,THE RAVEN,"Meant in croaking ""Nevermore."""
3286,THE RAVEN,
3287,THE RAVEN,"Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
3288,THE RAVEN,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
3289,THE RAVEN,"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
3290,THE RAVEN,"On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,"
3291,THE RAVEN,"But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,"
3292,THE RAVEN,"She shall press, ah, nevermore!"
3293,THE RAVEN,
3294,THE RAVEN,"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
3295,THE RAVEN,Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
3296,THE RAVEN,"""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath"
3297,THE RAVEN,sent thee
3298,THE RAVEN,
3299,THE RAVEN,Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
3300,THE RAVEN,"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"""
3301,THE RAVEN,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
3302,THE RAVEN,
3303,THE RAVEN,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!-"
3304,THE RAVEN,"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
3305,THE RAVEN,"Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted"
3306,THE RAVEN,"On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--"
3307,THE RAVEN,"Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"""
3308,THE RAVEN,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
3309,THE RAVEN,
3310,THE RAVEN,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!"
3311,THE RAVEN,By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
3312,THE RAVEN,"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,"
3313,THE RAVEN,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:
3314,THE RAVEN,"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."""
3315,THE RAVEN,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
3316,THE RAVEN,
3317,THE RAVEN,"""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!""  I shrieked,"
3318,THE RAVEN,upstarting--
3319,THE RAVEN,"""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!"
3320,THE RAVEN,Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
3321,THE RAVEN,Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
3322,THE RAVEN,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my"
3323,THE RAVEN,"door!"""
3324,THE RAVEN,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
3325,THE RAVEN,
3326,THE RAVEN,"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
3327,THE RAVEN,On the pallid bust of Pallas dust above my chamber door;
3328,THE RAVEN,"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,"
3329,THE RAVEN,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
3330,THE RAVEN,And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
3331,THE RAVEN,Shall be lifted--nevermore!
3332,THE RAVEN,
3333,THE RAVEN,
3334,THE RAVEN,
3335,THE RAVEN,
3336,TO HELEN,TO HELEN
3337,TO HELEN,
3338,TO HELEN,I saw thee once--once only--years ago
3339,TO HELEN,I must not say how many--but not many.
3340,TO HELEN,It was a July midnight; and from out
3341,TO HELEN,"A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,"
3342,TO HELEN,"Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,"
3343,TO HELEN,"There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,"
3344,TO HELEN,"With quietude and sultriness and slumber,"
3345,TO HELEN,Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
3346,TO HELEN,"Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,"
3347,TO HELEN,"Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--"
3348,TO HELEN,Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
3349,TO HELEN,"That gave out, in return for the love-light,"
3350,TO HELEN,Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--
3351,TO HELEN,Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
3352,TO HELEN,"That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted"
3353,TO HELEN,"By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence."
3354,TO HELEN,
3355,TO HELEN,"Clad all in white, upon a violet bank"
3356,TO HELEN,I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
3357,TO HELEN,"Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,"
3358,TO HELEN,"And on throe own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!"
3359,TO HELEN,
3360,TO HELEN,"Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--"
3361,TO HELEN,"Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow),"
3362,TO HELEN,"That bade me pause before that garden-gate,"
3363,TO HELEN,To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
3364,TO HELEN,"No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,"
3365,TO HELEN,"Save only thee and me.  (Oh, heaven!--oh, God!"
3366,TO HELEN,How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)
3367,TO HELEN,Save only thee and me.  I paused--I looked--
3368,TO HELEN,And in an instant all things disappeared.
3369,TO HELEN,"(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)"
3370,TO HELEN,The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
3371,TO HELEN,"The mossy banks and the meandering paths,"
3372,TO HELEN,"The happy flowers and the repining trees,"
3373,TO HELEN,Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
3374,TO HELEN,Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
3375,TO HELEN,All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:
3376,TO HELEN,Save only the divine light in throe eyes--
3377,TO HELEN,Save but the soul in throe uplifted eyes.
3378,TO HELEN,I saw but them--they were the world to me.
3379,TO HELEN,I saw but them--saw only them for hours--
3380,TO HELEN,Saw only there until the moon went down.
3381,TO HELEN,What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten
3382,TO HELEN,
3383,TO HELEN,"Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!"
3384,TO HELEN,How dark a wo! yet how sublime a hope!
3385,TO HELEN,How silently serene a sea of pride!
3386,TO HELEN,How daring an ambition! yet how deep--
3387,TO HELEN,How fathomless a capacity for love!
3388,TO HELEN,
3389,TO HELEN,"But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,"
3390,TO HELEN,Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
3391,TO HELEN,"And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees"
3392,TO HELEN,Didst glide away.  Only thine eyes remained.
3393,TO HELEN,They would not go--they never yet have gone.
3394,TO HELEN,"Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,"
3395,TO HELEN,They have not left me (as my hopes have) since.
3396,TO HELEN,They follow me--they lead me through the years--
3397,TO HELEN,They are my ministers--yet I their slave.
3398,TO HELEN,Their office is to illumine and enkindle--
3399,TO HELEN,"My duty, to be saved by their bright light,"
3400,TO HELEN,"And purified in their electric fire,"
3401,TO HELEN,And sanctified in their elysian fire.
3402,TO HELEN,"They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),"
3403,TO HELEN,And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to
3404,TO HELEN,"In the sad, silent watches of my night;"
3405,TO HELEN,While even in the meridian glare of day
3406,TO HELEN,I see them still--two sweetly scintillant
3407,TO HELEN,"Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"
3408,TO HELEN,
3409,TO HELEN,
3410,TO HELEN,
3411,TO HELEN,
3412,ANNABEL LEE,ANNABEL LEE
3413,ANNABEL LEE,
3414,ANNABEL LEE,"It was many and many a year ago,"
3415,ANNABEL LEE,In a kingdom by the sea
3416,ANNABEL LEE,That a maiden there lived whom you may know
3417,ANNABEL LEE,By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
3418,ANNABEL LEE,And this maiden she lived with no other thought
3419,ANNABEL LEE,Than to love and be loved by me.
3420,ANNABEL LEE,
3421,ANNABEL LEE,"I was a child and she was a child,"
3422,ANNABEL LEE,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
3423,ANNABEL LEE,But we loved with a love that was more than love--
3424,ANNABEL LEE,I and my ANNABEL LEE--
3425,ANNABEL LEE,With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
3426,ANNABEL LEE,Coveted her and me.
3427,ANNABEL LEE,
3428,ANNABEL LEE,"And this was the reason that, long ago,"
3429,ANNABEL LEE,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
3430,ANNABEL LEE,"A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling"
3431,ANNABEL LEE,My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
3432,ANNABEL LEE,So that her highborn kinsmen came
3433,ANNABEL LEE,"And bore her away from me,"
3434,ANNABEL LEE,To shut her up in a sepulchre
3435,ANNABEL LEE,In this kingdom by the sea.
3436,ANNABEL LEE,
3437,ANNABEL LEE,"The angels, not half so happy in heaven,"
3438,ANNABEL LEE,Went envying her and me--
3439,ANNABEL LEE,"Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,"
3440,ANNABEL LEE,In this kingdom by the sea)
3441,ANNABEL LEE,"That the wind came out of the cloud by night,"
3442,ANNABEL LEE,Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.
3443,ANNABEL LEE,
3444,ANNABEL LEE,But our love it was stronger by far than the love
3445,ANNABEL LEE,Of those who were older than we--
3446,ANNABEL LEE,Of many far wiser than we--
3447,ANNABEL LEE,"And neither the angels in heaven above,"
3448,ANNABEL LEE,"Nor the demons down under the sea,"
3449,ANNABEL LEE,Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
3450,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:
3451,ANNABEL LEE,
3452,ANNABEL LEE,"For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams"
3453,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
3454,ANNABEL LEE,"And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes"
3455,ANNABEL LEE,Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:
3456,ANNABEL LEE,"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side"
3457,ANNABEL LEE,Of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride
3458,ANNABEL LEE,In the sepulchre there by the sea--
3459,ANNABEL LEE,In her tomb by the sounding sea.

3467,THE BELLS,Silver bells!
3468,THE BELLS,What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
3469,THE BELLS,"How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,"
3470,THE BELLS,In the icy air of night!
3471,THE BELLS,While the stars that oversprinkle
3472,THE BELLS,"All the heavens, seem to twinkle"
3473,THE BELLS,With a crystalline delight
3474,THE BELLS,"Keeping time, time, time,"
3475,THE BELLS,"In a sort of Runic rhyme,"
3476,THE BELLS,To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
3477,THE BELLS,"From the bells, bells, bells, bells,"
3478,THE BELLS,"Bells, bells, bells--"
3479,THE BELLS,From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

3481,THE BELLS,"Hear the mellow wedding bells,"
3482,THE BELLS,Golden bells!
3483,THE BELLS,What a world of happiness their harmony foretell:
3484,THE BELLS,Through the balmy air of night
3485,THE BELLS,How they ring out their delight!
3486,THE BELLS,"From the molten-golden notes,"
3487,THE BELLS,"And all in tune,"
3488,THE BELLS,"What a liquid ditty floats,"
3489,THE BELLS,"To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats"
3490,THE BELLS,On the moon!
3491,THE BELLS,
3492,THE BELLS,"Oh, from out the sounding cells,"
3493,THE BELLS,What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
3494,THE BELLS,How it swells!
3495,THE BELLS,How it dwells
3496,THE BELLS,On the Future!--how it tells
3497,THE BELLS,Of the rapture that impels
3498,THE BELLS,To the swinging and the ringing
3499,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells--"
3500,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,"
3501,THE BELLS,"Bells, bells, bells--"
3502,THE BELLS,To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
3503,THE BELLS,
3504,THE BELLS,Hear the loud alarum bells--
3505,THE BELLS,Brazen bells!
3506,THE BELLS,"What a tale of terror, now their turbulency tells!"
3507,THE BELLS,In the startled ear of night
3508,THE BELLS,How they scream out their affright!
3509,THE BELLS,"Too much horrified to speak,"
3510,THE BELLS,"They can only shriek, shriek,"
3511,THE BELLS,"Out of tune,"
3512,THE BELLS,"In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,"
3513,THE BELLS,"In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,"
3514,THE BELLS,"Leaping higher, higher, higher,"
3515,THE BELLS,"With a desperate desire,"
3516,THE BELLS,And a resolute endeavor
3517,THE BELLS,"Now--now to sit, or never,"
3518,THE BELLS,By the side of the pale-faced moon.
3519,THE BELLS,"Oh, the bells, bells, bells!"
3520,THE BELLS,What a tale their terror tells
3521,THE BELLS,Of Despair!
3522,THE BELLS,"How they clang, and clash, and roar!"
3523,THE BELLS,What a horror they outpour
3524,THE BELLS,On the bosom of the palpitating air!
3525,THE BELLS,
3526,THE BELLS,"Yet, the ear, it fully knows,"
3527,THE BELLS,"By the twanging,"
3528,THE BELLS,"And the clanging,"
3529,THE BELLS,How the danger ebbs and flows;
3530,THE BELLS,"Yet the ear distinctly tells,"
3531,THE BELLS,"In the jangling,"
3532,THE BELLS,"And the wrangling,"
3533,THE BELLS,"How the danger sinks and swells,"
3534,THE BELLS,
3535,THE BELLS,By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
3536,THE BELLS,Of the bells--
3537,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,"
3538,THE BELLS,"Bells, belts, bells--"
3539,THE BELLS,In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
3540,THE BELLS,
3541,THE BELLS,Hear the tolling of the bells--
3542,THE BELLS,Iron bells
3543,THE BELLS,What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
3544,THE BELLS,"In the silence of the night,"
3545,THE BELLS,How we shiver with affright
3546,THE BELLS,At the melancholy menace of their tone:
3547,THE BELLS,
3548,THE BELLS,For every sound that floats
3549,THE BELLS,From the rust within their throats
3550,THE BELLS,Is a groan.
3551,THE BELLS,"And the people--ah, the people--"
3552,THE BELLS,"They that dwell up in the steeple,"
3553,THE BELLS,"All alone,"
3554,THE BELLS,"And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,"
3555,THE BELLS,"In that muffled monotone,"
3556,THE BELLS,"Feel a glory in so rolling,"
3557,THE BELLS,
3558,THE BELLS,On the human heart a stone--
3559,THE BELLS,They are neither man or woman--
3560,THE BELLS,They are neither brute nor human--
3561,THE BELLS,They are Ghouls:--
3562,THE BELLS,And their king it is who tolls:--
3563,THE BELLS,"And he rolls, rolls, rolls,"
3564,THE BELLS,Rolls
3565,THE BELLS,A paean from the bells!
3566,THE BELLS,And his merry bosom swells
3567,THE BELLS,With the paean of the bells!
3568,THE BELLS,"And he dances, and he yells;"
3569,THE BELLS,"Keeping time, time, time,"
3570,THE BELLS,"In a sort of Runic rhyme,"
3571,THE BELLS,To the paean of the bells:--
3572,THE BELLS,Of the bells
3573,THE BELLS,"Keeping time, time, time,"
3574,THE BELLS,"In a sort of Runic rhyme,"
3575,THE BELLS,To the throbbing of the bells--
3576,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells--"
3577,THE BELLS,To the sobbing of the bells:--
3578,THE BELLS,"Keeping time, time, time,"
3579,THE BELLS,"As he knells, knells, knells,"
3580,THE BELLS,"In a happy Runic rhyme,"
3581,THE BELLS,To the rolling of the bells--
3582,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells:--"
3583,THE BELLS,To the tolling of the bells--
3584,THE BELLS,"Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,"

3631,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,I heard the trailing garments of the Night
3632,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,Sweep through her marble halls!
3633,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light
3634,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,From the celestial walls!
3635,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3636,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"I felt her presence, by its spell of might,"
3637,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,Stoop o'er me from above;
3638,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"The calm, majestic presence of the Night,"
3639,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,As of the one I love.
3640,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3641,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,"
3642,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"The manifold, soft chimes,"
3643,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"That fill the haunted chambers of the Night,"
3644,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,Like some old poet's rhymes.
3645,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3646,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,From the cool cisterns of the midnight air
3647,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,My spirit drank repose;
3648,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,The fountain of perpetual peace flows there--
3649,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,From those deep cisterns flows.
3650,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3651,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear
3652,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,What man has borne before!
3653,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,"
3654,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,And they complain no more.
3655,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3656,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,Peace! Peace! Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!
3657,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"Descend with broad-winged flight,"
3658,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,"The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,"
3659,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,The best-beloved Night!
3660,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3661,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3662,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,
3663,HYMN TO THE NIGHT,

3719,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Who, with thy hollow breast"

3722,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3723,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Wrapt not in Eastern balms,"
3724,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,But with thy fleshless palms
3725,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Stretched, as if asking alms,"
3726,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Why dost thou haunt me?"""
3727,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3728,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Then, from those cavernous eyes"
3729,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Pale flashes seemed to rise,"
3730,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,As when the Northern skies
3731,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Gleam in December;
3732,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And, like the water's flow"
3733,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Under December's snow,"
3734,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Came a dull voice of woe
3735,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,From the heart's chamber.
3736,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3737,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""I was a Viking old!"
3738,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"My deeds, though manifold,"

3746,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Far in the Northern Land,"
3747,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"By the wild Baltic's strand,"
3748,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I, with my childish hand,"
3749,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Tamed the ger-falcon;
3750,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And, with my skates fast-bound,"
3751,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,"
3752,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,That the poor whimpering hound
3753,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Trembled to walk on.
3754,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3755,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Oft to his frozen lair"

3758,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fled like a shadow;
3759,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Oft through the forest dark
3760,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Followed the were-wolf's bark,"
3761,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Until the soaring lark
3762,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Sang from the meadow.
3763,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3764,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""But when I older grew,"
3765,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Joining a corsair's crew,"
3766,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,O'er the dark sea I flew
3767,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,With the marauders.
3768,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Wild was the life we led;
3769,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Many the souls that sped,"
3770,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Many the hearts that bled,"
3771,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,By our stern orders.
3772,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3773,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Many a wassail-bout"
3774,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Wore the long Winter out;
3775,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Often our midnight shout
3776,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Set the cocks crowing,"
3777,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,As we the Berserk's tale
3778,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Measured in cups of ale,"
3779,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Draining the oaken pail,"
3780,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Filled to o'erflowing.
3781,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3782,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Once as I told in glee"
3783,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Tales of the stormy sea,"
3784,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Soft eyes did gaze on me,"
3785,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Burning yet tender;
3786,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And as the white stars shine
3787,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"On the dark Norway pine,"
3788,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,On that dark heart of mine
3789,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fell their soft splendor.
3790,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3791,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""I wooed the blue-eyed maid,"
3792,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Yielding, yet half afraid,"
3793,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And in the forest's shade
3794,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Our vows were plighted.
3795,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Under its loosened vest
3796,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Fluttered her little breast,"
3797,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Like birds within their nest
3798,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,By the hawk frighted.
3799,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3800,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Bright in her father's hall"
3801,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Shields gleamed upon the wall,"
3802,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Loud sang the minstrels all,"
3803,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Chaunting his glory;
3804,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,When of old Hildebrand
3805,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I asked his daughter's hand,"
3806,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Mute did the minstrels stand
3807,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,To hear my story.
3808,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3809,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""While the brown ale he quaffed,"
3810,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Loud then the champion laughed,"
3811,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And as the wind-gusts waft
3812,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"The sea-foam brightly,"
3813,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"So the loud laugh of scorn,"
3814,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Out of those lips unshorn,"
3815,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,From the deep drinking-horn
3816,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Blew the foam lightly.
3817,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3818,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""She was a Prince's child,"
3819,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I but a Viking wild,"
3820,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And though she blushed and smiled,"
3821,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,I was discarded!
3822,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Should not the dove so white
3823,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Follow the sea-mew's flight,"
3824,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Why did they leave that night
3825,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Her nest unguarded?
3826,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3827,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Scarce had I put to sea,"
3828,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bearing the maid with me,--"
3829,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fairest of all was she
3830,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Among the Norsemen!--
3831,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"When on the white sea-strand,"
3832,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Waving his armed hand,"
3833,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Saw we old Hildebrand,"
3834,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,With twenty horsemen.
3835,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3836,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Then launched they to the blast,"
3837,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bent like a reed each mast,"
3838,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Yet we were gaining fast,"
3839,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,When the wind failed us;
3840,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And with a sudden flaw
3841,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Come round the gusty Skaw,"
3842,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,So that our foe we saw
3843,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Laugh as he hailed us.
3844,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3845,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""And as to catch the gale"
3846,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Round veered the flapping sail,"
3847,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Death! was the helmsman's hail
3848,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Death without quarter!
3849,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Mid-ships with iron keel
3850,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Struck we her ribs of steel;
3851,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Down her black hulk did reel
3852,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Through the black water!
3853,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3854,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""As with his wings aslant,"
3855,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Sails the fierce cormorant,"
3856,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Seeking some rocky haunt,"
3857,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"With his prey laden,"
3858,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"So toward the open main,"
3859,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Beating to sea again,"
3860,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Through the wild hurricane,"
3861,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Bore I the maiden.
3862,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3863,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Three weeks we westward bore,"
3864,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And when the storm was o'er,"
3865,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Cloud-like we saw the shore
3866,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Stretching to lee-ward;
3867,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,There for my lady's bower
3868,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Built I the lofty tower,"
3869,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Which to this very hour,"
3870,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Stands looking sea-ward.
3871,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3872,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""There lived we many years;"
3873,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Time dried the maiden's tears;
3874,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"She had forgot her fears,"
3875,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,She was a mother;
3876,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Death closed her mild blue eyes,"
3877,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Under that tower she lies;
3878,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Ne'er shall the sun arise
3879,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,On such another!
3880,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3881,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Still grew my bosom then,"
3882,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Still as a stagnant fen!
3883,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Hateful to me were men,"
3884,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,The sun-light hateful.
3885,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"In the vast forest here,"
3886,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Clad in my warlike gear,"
3887,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Fell I upon my spear,"
3888,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"O, death was grateful!"
3889,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
3890,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Thus, seamed with many scars"
3891,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bursting these prison bars,"
3892,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Up to its native stars
3893,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,My soul ascended!
3894,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,There from the flowing bowl
3895,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Deep drinks the warrior's soul,"
3896,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!"""
3897,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,--Thus the tale ended.

3902,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
3903,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3904,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"It was the schooner Hesperus,"
3905,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,That sailed the wintry sea:
3906,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And the skipper had taken his little daughter,"
3907,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,To bear him company.
3908,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3909,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,"
3910,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Her cheeks like the dawn of day,"
3911,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,"
3912,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,That ope in the month of May.
3913,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3914,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The skipper he stood beside the helm,"
3915,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"His pipe was in his mouth,"
3916,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
3917,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The smoke now West, now South."
3918,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3919,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Then up and spake an old Sailor,"
3920,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Had sailed the Spanish Main,"
3921,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""I pray thee, put into yonder port"
3922,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,For I fear a hurricane.
3923,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3924,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""Last night, the moon had a golden ring,"
3925,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And to-night no moon we see!"""
3926,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,"
3927,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And a scornful laugh laughed he.
3928,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3929,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Colder and louder blew the wind,"
3930,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A gale from the Northeast;
3931,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The snow fell hissing in the brine,"
3932,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And the billows frothed like yeast.
3933,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3934,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Down came the storm, and smote amain,"
3935,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,The vessel in its strength;
3936,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,"
3937,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Then leaped her cable's length,"
3938,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3939,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,"
3940,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And do not tremble so;
3941,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"For I can weather the roughest gale,"
3942,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"That ever wind did blow."""
3943,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3944,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
3945,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Against the stinging blast;
3946,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"He cut a rope from a broken spar,"
3947,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And bound her to the mast.
3948,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3949,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""O father! I hear the church-bells ring,"
3950,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"O say, what may it be?"""
3951,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"""
3952,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And he steered for the open sea.
3953,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3954,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""O father!  I hear the sound of guns,"
3955,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"O say, what may it be?"""
3956,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""Some ship in distress, that cannot live"
3957,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"In such an angry sea!"""
3958,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3959,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""O father!  I see a gleaming light,"
3960,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"O say, what may it be?"""
3961,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"But the father answered never a word,"
3962,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A frozen corpse was he.
3963,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3964,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,"
3965,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"With his face turned to the skies,"
3966,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
3967,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On his fixed and glassy eyes.
3968,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3969,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
3970,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,That saved she might be;
3971,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,"
3972,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On the Lake of Galilee.
3973,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3974,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And fast through the midnight dark and drear,"
3975,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Through the whistling sleet and snow,"
3976,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept"
3977,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Towards the reef of Norman's Woe.
3978,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3979,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And ever the fitful gusts between,"
3980,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A sound came from the land;
3981,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"It was the sound of the trampling surf,"
3982,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
3983,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
3984,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The breakers were right beneath her bows,"
3985,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"She drifted a dreary wreck,"
3986,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And a whooping billow swept the crew
3987,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Like icicles from her deck.

4757,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"That was all!  And yet, through the gloom and the light,"
4758,PAUL REVERES RIDE,The fate of a nation was riding that night;
4759,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,"
4760,PAUL REVERES RIDE,Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
4761,PAUL REVERES RIDE,
4762,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"He has left the village and mounted the steep,"
4763,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,"
4764,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;"
4765,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And under the alders, that skirt its edge,"
4766,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,"
4767,PAUL REVERES RIDE,Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
4768,PAUL REVERES RIDE,It was twelve by the village clock
4769,PAUL REVERES RIDE,When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
4770,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"He heard the crowing of the cock,"
4771,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And the barking of the farmer's dog,"
4772,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And felt the damp of the river fog,"
4773,PAUL REVERES RIDE,That rises after the sun goes down.
4774,PAUL REVERES RIDE,
4775,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"It was one by the village clock,"
4776,PAUL REVERES RIDE,When he galloped into Lexington.
4777,PAUL REVERES RIDE,He saw the gilded weathercock
4778,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Swim in the moonlight as he passed,"
4779,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,"
4780,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Gaze at him with a spectral glare,"
4781,PAUL REVERES RIDE,As if they already stood aghast
4782,PAUL REVERES RIDE,At the bloody work they would look upon.
4783,PAUL REVERES RIDE,
4784,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"It was two by the village clock,"
4785,PAUL REVERES RIDE,When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
4786,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"He heard the bleating of the flock,"
4787,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"And the twitter of birds among the trees,"
4788,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And felt the breath of the morning breeze
4789,PAUL REVERES RIDE,Blowing over the meadows brown.
4790,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And one was safe and asleep in his bed
4791,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Who at the bridge would be first to fall,"
4792,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Who that day would be lying dead,"
4793,PAUL REVERES RIDE,Pierced by a British musket-ball.
4794,PAUL REVERES RIDE,
4795,PAUL REVERES RIDE,You know the rest.
4796,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"In the books you have read,"
4797,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"How the British Regulars fired and fled,--"
4798,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"How the farmers gave them ball for ball,"
4799,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"From behind each fence and farmyard wall,"
4800,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Chasing the red-coats down the lane,"
4801,PAUL REVERES RIDE,Then crossing the fields to emerge again
4802,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Under the trees at the turn of the road,"
4803,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And only pausing to fire and load.
4804,PAUL REVERES RIDE,
4805,PAUL REVERES RIDE,So through the night rode Paul Revere;
4806,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And so through the night went his cry of alarm
4807,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"To every Middlesex village and farm,"
4808,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"A cry of defiance and not of fear,"
4809,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,"
4810,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And a word that shall echo forevermore!
4811,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,"
4812,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"Through all our history, to the last,"
4813,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"In the hour of darkness and peril and need,"
4814,PAUL REVERES RIDE,The people will waken and listen to hear
4815,PAUL REVERES RIDE,"The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,"
4816,PAUL REVERES RIDE,And the midnight message of Paul Revere.
4817,PAUL REVERES RIDE,

4823,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,KING ROBERT OF SICILY
4824,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4825,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane"
4826,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
4827,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Apparelled in magnificent attire,"
4828,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With retinue of many a knight and squire,"
4829,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat"
4830,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And heard the priests chant the Magnificat.
4831,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And as he listened, o'er and o'er again"
4832,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Repeated, like a burden or refrain,"
4833,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He caught the words, ""Deposuit potentes"
4834,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"De sede, et exaltavit humiles;"""
4835,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And slowly lifting up his kingly head
4836,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He to a learned clerk beside him said,"
4837,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""What mean these words?""  The clerk made answer meet,"
4838,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""He has put down the mighty from their seat,"
4839,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And has exalted them of low degree."""
4840,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,"
4841,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""'Tis well that such seditious words are sung"
4842,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;
4843,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"For unto priests and people be it known,"
4844,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"There is no power can push me from my throne!"""
4845,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,"
4846,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.
4847,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4848,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"When he awoke, it was already night;"
4849,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The church was empty, and there was no light,"
4850,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,"
4851,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Lighted a little space before some saint.
4852,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He started from his seat and gazed around,"
4853,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,But saw no living thing and heard no sound.
4854,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He groped towards the door, but it was locked;"
4855,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,"
4856,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,"
4857,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And imprecations upon men and saints.
4858,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
4859,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls!
4860,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4861,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"At length the sexton, hearing from without"
4862,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The tumult of the knocking and the shout,"
4863,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,"
4864,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Came with his lantern, asking, ""Who is there?"""
4865,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,"
4866,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""Open: 'tis I, the King!  Art thou afraid?"""
4867,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,"
4868,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"""
4869,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;
4870,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A man rushed by him at a single stride,"
4871,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,"
4872,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,"
4873,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But leaped into the blackness of the night,"
4874,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And vanished like a spectre from his sight.
4875,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4876,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane"
4877,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
4878,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Despoiled of his magnificent attire,"
4879,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire,"
4880,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,"
4881,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;
4882,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage"
4883,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"To right and left each seneschal and page,"
4884,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,"
4885,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.
4886,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;
4887,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,"
4888,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Until at last he reached the banquet--room,"
4889,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Blazing with light, and breathing with perfume."
4890,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4891,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"There on the dais sat another king,"
4892,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,"
4893,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert's self in features, form, and height,"
4894,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,But all transfigured with angelic light!
4895,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,It was an Angel; and his presence there
4896,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With a divine effulgence filled the air,"
4897,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"An exaltation, piercing the disguise,"
4898,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Though none the hidden Angel recognize.
4899,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4900,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,"
4901,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,"
4902,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Who met his looks of anger and surprise
4903,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,With the divine compassion of his eves;
4904,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Then said, ""Who art thou? and why com'st thou here?"""
4905,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"To which King Robert answered with a sneer,"
4906,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""I am the King, and come to claim my own"
4907,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"""
4908,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And suddenly, at these audacious words,"
4909,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;"
4910,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,"
4911,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""Nay, not the King, but the King's Jester, thou"
4912,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape,"
4913,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And for thy counsellor shaft lead an ape;
4914,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,"
4915,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!"""
4916,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4917,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,"
4918,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;
4919,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A group of tittering pages ran before,"
4920,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And as they opened wide the folding-door,"
4921,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,"
4922,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,"
4923,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
4924,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With the mock plaudits of ""Long live the King!"
4925,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4926,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,"
4927,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He said within himself, ""It was a dream!"""
4928,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But the straw rustled as he turned his head,"
4929,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"There were the cap and bells beside his bed,"
4930,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,"
4931,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,"
4932,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And in the corner, a revolting shape,"
4933,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.
4934,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,It was no dream; the world he loved so much
4935,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!
4936,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4937,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Days came and went; and now returned again
4938,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,To Sicily the old Saturnian reign
4939,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Under the Angel's governance benign
4940,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The happy island danced with corn and wine,"
4941,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And deep within the mountain's burning breast
4942,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Enceladus, the giant, was at rest."
4943,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4944,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,"
4945,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Sullen and silent and disconsolate.
4946,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,"
4947,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With looks bewildered and a vacant stare,"
4948,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,"
4949,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,"
4950,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His only friend the ape, his only food"
4951,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"What others left,--he still was unsubdued."
4952,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when the Angel met him on his way,"
4953,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And half in earnest, half in jest, would say,"
4954,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel"
4955,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,"
4956,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""Art thou the King?"" the passion of his woe"
4957,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Burst from him in resistless overflow,"
4958,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling"
4959,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The haughty answer back, ""I am, I am the King!"""
4960,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4961,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Almost three years were ended; when there came
4962,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Ambassadors of great repute and name
4963,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine."
4964,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane"
4965,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,By letter summoned them forthwith to come
4966,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.
4967,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel with great joy received his guests,"
4968,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And gave them presents of embroidered vests,"
4969,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,"
4970,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.
4971,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Then he departed with them o'er the sea
4972,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Into the lovely land of Italy,"
4973,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Whose loveliness was more resplendent made
4974,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"By the mere passing of that cavalcade,"
4975,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir"
4976,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.
4977,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And lo! among the menials, in mock state,"
4978,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,"
4979,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,"
4980,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The solemn ape demurely perched behind,"
4981,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert rode, making huge merriment"
4982,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,In all the country towns through which they went.
4983,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4984,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,The Pope received them with great pomp and blare
4985,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter's square,"
4986,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Giving his benediction and embrace,"
4987,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Fervent, and full of apostolic grace."
4988,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,While with congratulations and with prayers
4989,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He entertained the Angel unawares,"
4990,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert, the Jester, bursting through the crowd,"
4991,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud,"
4992,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""I am the King!  Look, and behold in me"
4993,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!"
4994,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,"
4995,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Is an impostor in a king's disguise.
4996,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
4997,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Do you not know me? does no voice within
4998,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Answer my cry, and say we are akin?"""
4999,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,"
5000,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Gazed at the Angel's countenance serene;
5001,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Emperor, laughing, said, ""It is strange sport"
5002,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"To keep a madman for thy Fool at court!"""
5003,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And the poor, baffled Jester in disgrace"
5004,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Was hustled back among the populace.
5005,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
5006,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"In solemn state the Holy Week went by,"
5007,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;
5008,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The presence of the Angel, with its light,"
5009,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Before the sun rose, made the city bright,"
5010,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,"
5011,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.
5012,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Even the Jester, on his bed of straw,"
5013,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw,"
5014,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He felt within a power unfelt before,"
5015,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,"
5016,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,He heard the rushing garments of the Lord
5017,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward."
5018,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
5019,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And now the visit ending, and once more"
5020,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Valmond returning to the Danube's shore,"
5021,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Homeward the Angel journeyed, and again"
5022,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The land was made resplendent with his train,"
5023,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Flashing along the towns of Italy
5024,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Unto Salerno, and from there by sea."
5025,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when once more within Palermo's wall,"
5026,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, seated on the throne in his great hall,"
5027,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He heard the Angelus from convent towers,"
5028,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"As if the better world conversed with ours,"
5029,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,"
5030,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And with a gesture bade the rest retire;
5031,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when they were alone, the Angel said,"
5032,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""Art thou the King?""  Then bowing down his head,"
5033,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,"
5034,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And meekly answered him: ""Thou knowest best!"
5035,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,"
5036,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And in some cloister's school of penitence,"
5037,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Across those stones, that pave the way to heaven,"
5038,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Walk barefoot, till my guilty soul is shriven!"""
5039,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
5040,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel smiled, and from his radiant face"
5041,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A holy light illumined all the place,"
5042,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And through the open window, loud and clear,"
5043,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,"
5044,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Above the stir and tumult of the street
5045,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""He has put down the mighty from their seat,"
5046,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And has exalted them of low degree!"""
5047,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And through the chant a second melody
5048,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Rose like the throbbing of a single string
5049,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"""I am an Angel, and thou art the King!"""
5050,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
5051,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert, who was standing near the throne,"
5052,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!"
5053,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But all apparelled as in days of old,"
5054,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;
5055,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when his courtiers came, they found him there"
5056,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer."

5068,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his chamber all alone,"
5069,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Kneeling on the floor of stone,"
5070,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
5071,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For his sins of indecision,"
5072,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed for greater self-denial
5073,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In temptation and in trial;
5074,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It was noonday by the dial,"
5075,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the Monk was all alone.
5076,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5077,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Suddenly, as if it lightened,"
5078,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,An unwonted splendor brightened
5079,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,All within him and without him
5080,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In that narrow cell of stone;
5081,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And he saw the Blessed Vision
5082,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of our Lord, with light Elysian"
5083,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Like a vesture wrapped about Him,"
5084,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a garment round Him thrown.

5086,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not as crucified and slain,"
5087,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not in agonies of pain,"
5088,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not with bleeding hands and feet,"
5089,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Did the Monk his Master see;
5090,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But as in the village street,"
5091,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In the house or harvest-field,"
5092,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Halt and lame and blind He healed,"

5107,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Loud the convent bell appalling,"
5108,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
5109,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rang through court and corridor
5110,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With persistent iteration

5118,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For their daily dole of food
5119,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Dealt them by the brotherhood;
5120,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And their almoner was he
5121,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who upon his bended knee,"
5122,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rapt in silent ecstasy
5123,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of divinest self-surrender,"
5124,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Saw the Vision and the Splendor.
5125,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Deep distress and hesitation
5126,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Mingled with his adoration;
5127,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Should he go or should he stay?
5128,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Should he leave the poor to wait
5129,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hungry at the convent gate,"
5130,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Till the Vision passed away?
5131,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Should he slight his radiant guest,"
5132,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slight this visitant celestial,"
5133,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For a crowd of ragged, bestial"
5134,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Beggars at the convent gate?
5135,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision there remain?
5136,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision come again?
5137,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Then a voice within his breast
5138,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Whispered, audible and clear"
5139,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,As if to the outward ear
5140,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Do thy duty; that is best;"
5141,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Leave unto thy Lord the rest!"""
5142,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5143,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Straightway to his feet he started,"
5144,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And with longing look intent
5145,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"On the Blessed Vision bent,"
5146,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slowly from his cell departed,"
5147,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Slowly on his errand went.
5148,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5149,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the gate the poor were waiting,"
5150,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Looking through the iron grating,"
5151,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With that terror in the eye
5152,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That is only seen in those
5153,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Who amid their wants and woes
5154,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hear the sound of doors that close,"
5155,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And of feet that pass them by;
5156,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Grown familiar with disfavor,"
5157,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Grown familiar with the savor
5158,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Of the bread by which men die!
5159,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5160,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But to-day, they know not why,"
5161,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like the gate of Paradise
5162,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Seemed the convent gate to rise,"
5163,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a sacrament divine
5164,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Seemed to them the bread and wine.
5165,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his heart the Monk was praying,"
5166,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thinking of the homeless poor,"
5167,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,What they suffer and endure;
5168,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"What we see not, what we see;"
5169,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the inward voice was saying
5170,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Whatsoever thing thou doest"
5171,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"To the least of mine and lowest,"
5172,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"That thou doest unto me!"""
5173,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5174,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Unto me! but had the Vision
5175,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Come to him in beggar's clothing,"
5176,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Come a mendicant imploring.
5177,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Would he then have knelt adoring,"
5178,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Or have listened with derision,"
5179,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And have turned away with loathing?
5180,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5181,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thus his conscience put the question,"
5182,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Full of troublesome suggestion,"
5183,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As at length, with hurried pace,"
5184,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Towards his cell he turned his face,"
5185,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And beheld the convent bright
5186,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"With a supernatural light,"
5187,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a luminous cloud expanding
5188,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Over floor and wall and ceiling.
5189,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
5190,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,But he paused with awe-struck feeling
5191,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the threshold of his door,"
5192,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For the Vision still was standing
5193,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As he left it there before,"
5194,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the convent bell appalling,"
5195,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
5196,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Summoned him to feed the poor.
5197,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Through the long hour intervening
5198,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It had waited his return,"
5199,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"And he felt his bosom burn,"
5200,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Comprehending all the meaning,"
5201,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the Blessed Vision said,"
5202,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!"""

5226,PROEM,
5227,PROEM,"The rigor of a frozen clime,"

5561,BARCLAY OF URY,"Hunted, outlawed, held in thrall,"

5595,BARCLAY OF URY,"Plot in vain, Confessor old,"

5643,RAPHAEL,
5644,RAPHAEL,I shall not soon forget that sight:
5645,RAPHAEL,"The glow of autumn's westering day,"
5646,RAPHAEL,"A hazy warmth, a dreamy light,"
5647,RAPHAEL,On Raphael's picture lay.
5648,RAPHAEL,
5649,RAPHAEL,"It was a simple print I saw,"
5650,RAPHAEL,The fair face of a musing boy;
5651,RAPHAEL,"Yet, while I gazed, a sense of awe"
5652,RAPHAEL,Seemed blending with my joy.
5653,RAPHAEL,
5654,RAPHAEL,A simple print:--the graceful flow
5655,RAPHAEL,"Of boyhood's soft and wavy hair,"
5656,RAPHAEL,"And fresh young lip and cheek, and brow"
5657,RAPHAEL,"Unmarked and clear, were there."
5658,RAPHAEL,
5659,RAPHAEL,Yet through its sweet and calm repose
5660,RAPHAEL,I saw the inward spirit shine;
5661,RAPHAEL,It was as if before me rose
5662,RAPHAEL,The white veil of a shrine.
5663,RAPHAEL,
5664,RAPHAEL,"As if, as Gothland's sage has told,"
5665,RAPHAEL,"The hidden life, the man within,"
5666,RAPHAEL,"Dissevered from its frame and mould,"
5667,RAPHAEL,By mortal eye were seen.
5668,RAPHAEL,
5669,RAPHAEL,"Was it the lifting of that eye,"
5670,RAPHAEL,The waving of that pictured hand?
5671,RAPHAEL,"Loose as a cloud-wreath on the sky,"
5672,RAPHAEL,I saw the walls expand.
5673,RAPHAEL,
5674,RAPHAEL,"The narrow room had vanished,--space,"
5675,RAPHAEL,"Broad, luminous, remained alone,"
5676,RAPHAEL,Through which all hues and shapes of grace
5677,RAPHAEL,And beauty looked or shone.
5678,RAPHAEL,
5679,RAPHAEL,Around the mighty master came
5680,RAPHAEL,"The marvels which his pencil wrought,"
5681,RAPHAEL,Those miracles of power whose fame
5682,RAPHAEL,Is wide as human thought.
5683,RAPHAEL,
5684,RAPHAEL,"There drooped thy more than mortal face,"
5685,RAPHAEL,"O Mother, beautiful and mild!"
5686,RAPHAEL,Enfolding in one dear embrace
5687,RAPHAEL,Thy Saviour and thy Child!
5688,RAPHAEL,
5689,RAPHAEL,The rapt brow of the Desert John;
5690,RAPHAEL,The awful glory of that day
5691,RAPHAEL,When all the Father's brightness shone
5692,RAPHAEL,Through manhood's veil of clay.
5693,RAPHAEL,
5694,RAPHAEL,"And, midst gray prophet forms, and wild"
5695,RAPHAEL,"Dark visions of the days of old,"
5696,RAPHAEL,How sweetly woman's beauty smiled
5697,RAPHAEL,Through locks of brown and gold!
5698,RAPHAEL,
5699,RAPHAEL,There Fornarina's fair young face
5700,RAPHAEL,"Once more upon her lover shone,"
5701,RAPHAEL,Whose model of an angel's grace
5702,RAPHAEL,He borrowed from her own.
5703,RAPHAEL,
5704,RAPHAEL,"Slow passed that vision from my view,"
5705,RAPHAEL,But not the lesson which it taught;
5706,RAPHAEL,"The soft, calm shadows which it threw"
5707,RAPHAEL,Still rested on my thought
5708,RAPHAEL,
5709,RAPHAEL,"The truth, that painter, bard, and sage,"
5710,RAPHAEL,"Even in Earth's cold and changeful clime,"
5711,RAPHAEL,Plant for their deathless heritage
5712,RAPHAEL,The fruits and flowers of time.
5713,RAPHAEL,
5714,RAPHAEL,We shape ourselves the joy or fear
5715,RAPHAEL,"Of which the coming life is made,"
5716,RAPHAEL,And fill our Future's atmosphere
5717,RAPHAEL,With sunshine or with shade.
5718,RAPHAEL,
5719,RAPHAEL,The tissue of the Life to be
5720,RAPHAEL,"We weave with colors all our own,"
5721,RAPHAEL,And in the field of Destiny
5722,RAPHAEL,We reap as we have sown.
5723,RAPHAEL,
5724,RAPHAEL,Still shall the soul around it call
5725,RAPHAEL,"The shadows which it gathered here,"
5726,RAPHAEL,"And, painted on the eternal wall,"
5727,RAPHAEL,The Past shall reappear.
5728,RAPHAEL,
5729,RAPHAEL,Think ye the notes of holy song
5730,RAPHAEL,On Milton's tuneful ear have died?
5731,RAPHAEL,Think ye that Raphael's angel throng
5732,RAPHAEL,Has vanished from his side?
5733,RAPHAEL,
5734,RAPHAEL,O no!--We live our life again
5735,RAPHAEL,"Or warmly touched, or coldly dim,"
5736,RAPHAEL,"The pictures of the Past remain,--"
5737,RAPHAEL,Man's works shall follow him!

6255,MAUD MULLER,"""I'd dress my mother so grand and gay,"
6256,MAUD MULLER,And the baby should have a new toy each day.
6257,MAUD MULLER,
6258,MAUD MULLER,"""And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor"
6259,MAUD MULLER,"And all should bless me who left our door."""
6260,MAUD MULLER,
6261,MAUD MULLER,"The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,"
6262,MAUD MULLER,And saw Maud Muller standing still.
6263,MAUD MULLER,
6264,MAUD MULLER,"""A form more fair, a face more sweet"
6265,MAUD MULLER,Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.
6266,MAUD MULLER,

6274,MAUD MULLER,"Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,"
6275,MAUD MULLER,
6276,MAUD MULLER,"""But low of cattle and song of birds,"
6277,MAUD MULLER,"And health and quiet and loving words."""
6278,MAUD MULLER,
6279,MAUD MULLER,"But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,"
6280,MAUD MULLER,"And his mother, vain of her rank and gold."
6281,MAUD MULLER,
6282,MAUD MULLER,"So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,"
6283,MAUD MULLER,And Maud was left in the field alone.
6284,MAUD MULLER,
6285,MAUD MULLER,"But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,"
6286,MAUD MULLER,When he hummed in court an old love-tune;
6287,MAUD MULLER,
6288,MAUD MULLER,"And the young girl mused beside the well,"
6289,MAUD MULLER,"Till the rain on the unraked clover,"
6290,MAUD MULLER,
6291,MAUD MULLER,"He wedded a wife of richest dower,"
6292,MAUD MULLER,"Who lived for fashion, as he for power."
6293,MAUD MULLER,
6294,MAUD MULLER,"Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow,"
6295,MAUD MULLER,He watched a picture come and go;
6296,MAUD MULLER,
6297,MAUD MULLER,And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes
6298,MAUD MULLER,Looked out in their innocent surprise.
6299,MAUD MULLER,
6300,MAUD MULLER,"Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,"
6301,MAUD MULLER,He longed for the wayside well instead;
6302,MAUD MULLER,
6303,MAUD MULLER,And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
6304,MAUD MULLER,To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.
6305,MAUD MULLER,
6306,MAUD MULLER,"And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,"
6307,MAUD MULLER,"""Ah, that I were free again!"
6308,MAUD MULLER,
6309,MAUD MULLER,"""Free as when I rode that day,"
6310,MAUD MULLER,"Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay."""
6311,MAUD MULLER,
6312,MAUD MULLER,"She wedded a man unlearned and poor,"
6313,MAUD MULLER,And many children played round her door.
6314,MAUD MULLER,
6315,MAUD MULLER,"But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain,"
6316,MAUD MULLER,Left their traces on heart and brain.
6317,MAUD MULLER,
6318,MAUD MULLER,"And oft, when the summer sun shone hot"
6319,MAUD MULLER,"On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,"
6320,MAUD MULLER,
6321,MAUD MULLER,And she heard the little spring brook fall
6322,MAUD MULLER,"Over the roadside, through the wall;"
6323,MAUD MULLER,
6324,MAUD MULLER,In the shade of the apple-tree again
6325,MAUD MULLER,She saw a rider draw his rein.
6326,MAUD MULLER,
6327,MAUD MULLER,And gazing down with timid grace
6328,MAUD MULLER,She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
6329,MAUD MULLER,
6330,MAUD MULLER,Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
6331,MAUD MULLER,Stretched away into stately halls;
6332,MAUD MULLER,
6333,MAUD MULLER,"The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,"
6334,MAUD MULLER,"The tallow candle an astral burned,"
6335,MAUD MULLER,
6336,MAUD MULLER,"And for him who sat by the chimney lug,"
6337,MAUD MULLER,"Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug,"
6338,MAUD MULLER,
6339,MAUD MULLER,"A manly form at her side she saw,"
6340,MAUD MULLER,And joy was duty and love was law.
6341,MAUD MULLER,
6342,MAUD MULLER,"Then she took up her burden of life again,"
6343,MAUD MULLER,"Saying only, ""it might have been."""
6344,MAUD MULLER,
6345,MAUD MULLER,"Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,"
6346,MAUD MULLER,For rich repiner and household drudge!
6347,MAUD MULLER,
6348,MAUD MULLER,
6349,MAUD MULLER,"God pity them both! and pity us all,"
6350,MAUD MULLER,Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
6351,MAUD MULLER,
6352,MAUD MULLER,"For of all sad words of tongue or pen,"
6353,MAUD MULLER,"The saddest are these: ""It might have been!"""
6354,MAUD MULLER,
6355,MAUD MULLER,"Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies"
6356,MAUD MULLER,Deeply buried from human eyes;
6357,MAUD MULLER,
6358,MAUD MULLER,"And, in the hereafter, angels may"
6359,MAUD MULLER,Roll the stone from its grave away!

6654,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6655,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,O friends! with whom my feet have trod
6656,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"The quiet aisles of prayer,"
6657,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Glad witness to your zeal for God
6658,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And love of man I bear.
6659,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6660,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I trace your lines of argument;
6661,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Your logic linked and strong
6662,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I weigh as one who dreads dissent,"
6663,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And fears a doubt as wrong.
6664,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6665,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,But still my human hands are weak
6666,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,To hold your iron creeds;
6667,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Against the words ye bid me speak
6668,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,My heart within me pleads.
6669,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6670,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Who fathoms the Eternal Thought?
6671,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Who talks of scheme and plan?
6672,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The Lord is God!  He needeth not
6673,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The poor device of man.
6674,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6675,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground"
6676,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye tread with boldness shod:
6677,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I dare not fix with mete and bound
6678,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The love and power of God.
6679,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6680,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye praise His justice; even such
6681,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His pitying love I deem
6682,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye seek a king; I fain would touch
6683,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The robe that hath no seam.
6684,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6685,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Ye see the curse which overbroods
6686,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,A world of pain and loss;
6687,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I hear our Lord's beatitudes
6688,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And prayer upon the cross.
6689,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6690,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The wrong that pains my soul below
6691,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I dare not throne above:
6692,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I know not of His hate,--I know"
6693,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His goodness and His love.
6694,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6695,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I dimly guess from blessings known
6696,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Of greater out of sight,"
6697,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And, with the chastened Psalmist, own"
6698,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His judgments too are right.
6699,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6700,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I long for household voices gone,"
6701,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"For vanished smiles I long,"
6702,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"But God bath led my dear ones on,"
6703,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And He can do no wrong.
6704,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6705,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I know not what the future hath
6706,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Of marvel or surprise,"
6707,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Assured alone that life and death
6708,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,His mercy underlies.
6709,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6710,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And if my heart and flesh are weak
6711,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"To bear an untried pain,"
6712,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"The bruised reed He will not break,"
6713,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,But strengthen and sustain.
6714,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6715,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"No offering of my own I have,"
6716,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Nor works my faith to prove;
6717,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"I can but give the gifts He gave,"
6718,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And plead His love for love.
6719,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6720,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,And so beside the Silent Sea
6721,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I wait the muffled oar;
6722,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,No harm from Him can come to me
6723,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,On ocean or on shore.
6724,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6725,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I know not where His islands lift
6726,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Their fronded palms in air;
6727,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,I only know I cannot drift
6728,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Beyond His love and care.
6729,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6730,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"O brothers! if my faith is vain,"
6731,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"If hopes like these betray,"
6732,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Pray for me that my feet may gain
6733,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,The sure and safer way.
6734,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,
6735,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"And Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen"
6736,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,"Thy creatures as they be,"
6737,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,Forgive me if too close I lean
6738,THE ETERNAL GOODNESS,My human heart on Thee!

6759,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Sweet sounds the ancient pibroch
6760,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"O'er mountain, loch, and glade;"
6761,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,But the sweetest of all music
6762,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The Pipes at Lucknow played.
6763,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6764,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Day by day the Indian tiger
6765,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Louder yelled, and nearer crept;"
6766,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Round and round the jungle-serpent
6767,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Near and nearer circles swept.
6768,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"""Pray for rescue, wives and mothers,--"

6774,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Till their hope became despair;
6775,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,And the sobs of low bewailing
6776,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Filled the pauses of their prayer.
6777,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Then up spake a Scottish maiden,"
6778,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,With her ear unto the ground
6779,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"""Dinna ye hear it?--dinna ye hear it?"
6780,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"The pipes o' Havelock sound!"""
6781,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6782,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Hushed the wounded man his groaning;
6783,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Hushed the wife her little ones;
6784,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Alone they heard the drum-roll
6785,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,And the roar of Sepoy guns.
6786,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,But to sounds of home and childhood
6787,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The Highland ear was true;
6788,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,As her mother's cradle-crooning
6789,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The mountain pipes she knew.
6790,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6791,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Like the march of soundless music
6792,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Through the vision of the seer,"
6793,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"More of feeling than of hearing,"
6794,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Of the heart than of the ear,"
6795,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"She knew the droning pibroch,"
6796,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,She knew the Campbell's call

6799,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6800,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"O, they listened, dumb and breathless,"
6801,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,And they caught the sound at last;
6802,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Faint and far beyond the Goomtee
6803,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Rose and fell the piper's blast!
6804,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Then a burst of wild thanksgiving
6805,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Mingled woman's voice and man's
6806,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"""God be praised!--the March of Havelock!"

6811,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Came the wild MacGregor's clan-call,"
6812,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Stinging all the air to life.
6813,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,But when the far-off dust-cloud
6814,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"To plaided legions grew,"
6815,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Full tenderly and blithesomely
6816,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The pipes of rescue blew!
6817,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6818,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Round the silver domes of Lucknow,"
6819,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Moslem mosque and Pagan shrine,"
6820,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"Breathed the air to Britons dearest,"
6821,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The air of Auld Lang Syne.
6822,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,O'er the cruel roll of war-drums
6823,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Rose that sweet and homelike strain;
6824,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"And the tartan clove the turban,"
6825,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,As the Goomtee cleaves the plain.
6826,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,
6827,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Dear to the corn-land reaper
6828,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"And plaided mountaineer,--"
6829,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,To the cottage and the castle
6830,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,The piper's song is dear.
6831,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,Sweet sounds the Gaelic pibroch
6832,THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW,"O'er mountain, glen, and glade,"

8846,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8847,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"What visionary tints the year puts on,"
8848,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,When failing leaves falter through motionless air
8849,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Or numbly cling and shiver to be gone!
8850,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How shimmer the low flats and pastures bare,"
8851,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As with her nectar Hebe Autumn fills
8852,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The bowl between me and those distant hills,"
8853,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And smiles and shakes abroad her misty, tremulous hair!"
8854,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8855,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,No more the landscape holds its wealth apart.
8856,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Making me poorer in my poverty,"
8857,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,But mingles with my senses and my heart;
8858,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,My own projected spirit seems to me
8859,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In her own reverie the world to steep;
8860,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"'Tis she that waves to sympathetic sleep,"
8861,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Moving, as she is moved, each field and hill, and tree."
8862,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8863,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How fuse and mix, with what unfelt degrees,"
8864,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Clasped by the faint horizon's languid arms,"
8865,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Each into each, the hazy distances!"
8866,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The softened season all the landscape charms;
8867,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Those hills, my native village that embay,"
8868,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In waves of dreamier purple roll away,"
8869,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms.
8870,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8871,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Far distant sounds the hidden chickadee
8872,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Close at my side; far distant sound the leaves;
8873,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The fields seem fields of dream, where Memory"
8874,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Wanders like gleaning Ruth; and as the sheaves
8875,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
8876,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of Boaz as the maiden's glow went by,"
8877,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,So tremble and seem remote all things the sense receives.
8878,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8879,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The cock's shrill trump that tells of scattered corn,"
8880,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Passed breezily on by all his flapping mates,"
8881,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Faint and more faint, from barn to barn is borne,"
8882,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Southward, perhaps to far Magellan's Straits;"
8883,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dimly I catch the throb of distant flails;
8884,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Silently overhead the henhawk sails,"
8885,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With watchful, measuring eye, and for his quarry waits."
8886,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8887,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The sobered robin, hunger-silent now,"
8888,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Leeks cedar-berries blue, his autumn cheer;"
8889,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The squirrel on the shingly shagbark's bough,"
8890,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now saws, now lists with downward eye and ear,"
8891,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then drops his nut, and, with a chipping bound,"
8892,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whisks to his winding fastness underground;
8893,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere.
8894,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8895,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows
8896,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drowse on the crisp, gray moss; the ploughman's call"
8897,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps, faint as smoke from black, fresh-furrowed meadows;"
8898,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The single crow a single caw lets fall
8899,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And all around me every bush and tree
8900,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Says Autumn's here, and Winter soon will"
8901,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who snows his soft, white sleep and silence over all."
8902,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8903,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The birch, most shy and lady-like of trees,"
8904,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Her poverty, as best she may, retrieves,"
8905,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And hints at her foregone gentilities
8906,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With some saved relics of her wealth of leaves
8907,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The swamp-oak, with his royal purple on,"
8908,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Glares red as blood across the sinking sun,"
8909,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves
8910,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8911,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"He looks a sachem, in red blanket wrapt,"
8912,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, mid some council of the sad-garbed whites,"
8913,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Erect and stern, in his own memories lapt,"
8914,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With distant eye broods over other sights,"
8915,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Sees the hushed wood the city's flare replace,"
8916,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wounded turf heal o'er the railway's trace,"
8917,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And roams the savage Past of his undwindled rights.
8918,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8919,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The red-oak, softer-grained, yields all for lost,"
8920,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And, with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry,"
8921,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"After the first betrayal of the frost,"
8922,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Rebuffs the kiss of the relenting sky;
8923,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The chestnuts, lavish of their long-hid gold,"
8924,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To the faint Summer, beggared now and old,"
8925,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Pour back the sunshine hoarded 'neath her favoring eye.
8926,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8927,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The ash her purple drops forgivingly
8928,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And sadly, breaking not the general hush;"
8929,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The maple-swamps glow like a sunset sea,"
8930,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
8931,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze;
8932,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of bushes low, as when, on cloudy days,"
8933,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere the rain falls, the cautious farmer burns his brush."
8934,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8935,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"O'er yon low wall, which guards one unkempt zone,"
8936,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where vines, and weeds, and scrub-oaks intertwine"
8937,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Safe from the plough, whose rough, discordant stone"
8938,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Is massed to one soft gray by lichens fine,"
8939,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The tangled blackberry, crossed and recrossed, weaves"
8940,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A prickly network of ensanguined leaves;
8941,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hard by, with coral beads, the prim black-alders shine."
8942,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8943,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Pillaring with flame this crumbling boundary,"
8944,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose loose blocks topple 'neath the ploughboy's foot,"
8945,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, with each sense shut fast except the eye,"
8946,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps close and scares the jay he hoped to shoot,"
8947,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The woodbine up the elm's straight stem aspires.
8948,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Coiling it, harmless, with autumnal fires;"
8949,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In the ivy's paler blaze the martyr oak stands mute.
8950,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8951,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Below, the Charles--a stripe of nether sky,"
8952,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now hid by rounded apple-trees between,"
8953,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose gaps the misplaced sail sweeps bellying by,"
8954,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now flickering golden through a woodland screen,"
8955,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then spreading out at his next turn beyond,"
8956,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A silver circle like an inland pond--
8957,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Slips seaward silently through marshes purple and green.
8958,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8959,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dear marshes! vain to him the gift of sight
8960,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who cannot in their various incomes share,"
8961,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"From every season drawn, of shade and light,"
8962,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Who sees in them but levels brown and bare;
8963,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each change of storm or sunshine scatters free
8964,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"On them its largesse of variety,"
8965,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,For nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare.
8966,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8967,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In Spring they lie one broad expanse of green,"
8968,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er which the light winds run with glimmering feet;
8969,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Here, yellower stripes track out the creek unseen"
8970,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"here, darker growths o'er hidden ditches meet;"
8971,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd,"
8972,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As if the silent shadow of a cloud
8973,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hung there becalmed, with the next breath to fleet."
8974,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8975,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"All round, upon the river's slippery edge,"
8976,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Witching to deeper calm the drowsy tide,"
8977,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whispers and leans the breeze-entangling sedge;
8978,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through emerald glooms the lingering waters slide,"
8979,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or, sometimes wavering, throw back the sun,"
8980,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the stiff banks in eddies melt and run
8981,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of dimpling light, and with the current seem to glide."
8982,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8983,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In Summer 'tis a blithesome sight to see,"
8984,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"As step by step, with measured swing, they pass,"
8985,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wide-ranked mowers evading to the knee,"
8986,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their sharp scythes panting through the thick-set grass
8987,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, stretched beneath a rick's shade in a ring,"
8988,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Their nooning take, while one begins to sing"
8989,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A stave that droops and dies 'neath the close sky of brass.
8990,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8991,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Meanwhile the devil-may-care, the bobolink,"
8992,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Remembering duty, in mid-quaver stops"
8993,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Just ere he sweeps O'er rapture's tremulous brink,"
8994,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And 'twixt the winrows most demurely drops,"
8995,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"A decorous bird of business, who provides"
8996,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"For his brown mate and fledglings six besides,"
8997,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And looks from right to left, a farmer mid his crops."
8998,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
8999,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Another change subdues them in the Fall,"
9000,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But saddens not, they still show merrier tints,"
9001,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Though sober russet seems to cover all;
9002,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When the first sunshine through their dew-drops glints,"
9003,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Look how the yellow clearness, streamed across,"
9004,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Redeems with rarer hues the season's loss,"
9005,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As Dawn's feet there had touched and left their rosy prints.
9006,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9007,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or come when sunset gives its freshened zest,"
9008,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lean o'er the bridge and let the ruddy thrill,"
9009,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While the shorn sun swells down the hazy west,"
9010,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Glow opposite; the marshes drink their fill
9011,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And swoon with purple veins, then slowly fade"
9012,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through pink to brown, as eastward moves the shade,"
9013,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lengthening with stealthy creep, of Simond's darkening hill."
9014,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9015,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Later, and yet ere Winter wholly shuts,"
9016,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere through the first dry snow the runner grates,"
9017,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And the loath cart-wheel screams in slippery ruts,"
9018,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While the firmer ice the eager boy awaits,"
9019,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Trying each buckle and strap beside the fire,"
9020,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And until bedtime--plays with his desire,"
9021,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twenty times putting on and off his new-bought skates;--
9022,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9023,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, every morn, the river's banks shine bright"
9024,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With smooth plate-armor, treacherous and frail,"
9025,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"By the frost's clinking hammers forged at night,"
9026,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"""Gainst which the lances of the sun prevail,"
9027,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Giving a pretty emblem of the day
9028,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When guitar arms in light shall melt away,"
9029,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And states shall move free limbed, loosed from war's cramping"
9030,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,mail.
9031,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9032,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And now those waterfalls the ebbing river
9033,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twice everyday creates on either side
9034,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Tinkle, as through their fresh-sparred grots they shiver"
9035,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In grass-arched channels to the sun denied;
9036,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"High flaps in sparkling blue the far-heard crow,"
9037,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The silvered flats gleam frostily below,"
9038,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide.
9039,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9040,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But, crowned in turn by vying seasons three,"
9041,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their winter halo hath a fuller ring;
9042,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"This glory seems to rest immovably,--"
9043,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The others were too fleet and vanishing;
9044,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When the hid tide is at its highest flow,"
9045,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er marsh and stream one breathless trance of snow
9046,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything.
9047,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9048,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind,"
9049,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As pale as formal candles lit by day;
9050,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Gropes to the sea the river dumb and blind;
9051,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The brown ricks, snow-thatched by the storm in play,"
9052,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Show pearly breakers combing o'er their lee,"
9053,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"White crests as of some just enchanted sea,"
9054,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Checked in their maddest leap and hanging poised midway.
9055,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9056,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But when the eastern blow, with rain aslant,"
9057,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,From mid-sea's prairies green and rolling plains
9058,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drives in his wallowing herds of billows gaunt,"
9059,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the roused Charles remembers in his veins
9060,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Old Ocean's blood and snaps his gyves of frost,"
9061,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That tyrannous silence on the shores is tost
9062,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In dreary wreck, and crumbling desolation reigns."
9063,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9064,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Edgewise or flat, in Druid-like device,"
9065,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With leaden pools between or gullies bare,"
9066,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice;"
9067,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"No life, no sound, to break the grim despair,"
9068,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff"
9069,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Down crackles riverward some thaw-sapped cliff,"
9070,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Or ashen the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there.
9071,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9072,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,But let me turn from fancy-pictured scenes
9073,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,To that whose pastoral calm before me lies:
9074,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes;
9075,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The early evening with her misty dyes
9076,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh,"
9077,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Relieves the distant with her cooler sky,"
9078,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes"
9079,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9080,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There gleams my native village, dear to me,"
9081,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Though higher change's waves each day are seen,"
9082,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whelming fields famed in boyhood's history,"
9083,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Sanding with houses the diminished green;
9084,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There, in red brick, which softening time defies,"
9085,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Stand square and stiff the Muses' factories;
9086,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,How with my life knit up is every well-known scene!
9087,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
9088,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Flow on, dear river! not alone you flow"
9089,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To outward sight, and through your marshes wind;"
9090,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Fed from the mystic springs of long-ago,"
9091,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Your twin flows silent through my world of mind
9092,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Grow dim, dear marshes, in the evening's gray!"
9093,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Before my inner sight ye stretch away,"
9094,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And will forever, though these fleshly eyes grow blind."

9101,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(Selections)
9102,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9103,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I.  Emerson.
9104,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9105,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""There comes Emerson first, whose rich words, every one,"
9106,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on,"
9107,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Whose prose is grand verse, while his verse, the Lord knows,"
9108,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Is some of it pr----  No, 'tis not even prose;"
9109,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I'm speaking of metres; some poems have welled
9110,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From those rare depths of soul that have ne'er been excelled;
9111,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"They're not epics, but that doesn't matter a pin,"
9112,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In creating, the only hard thing's to begin;"
9113,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A grass-blade's no easier to make than an oak,"
9114,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If you've once found the way you've achieved the grand stroke;
9115,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,"
9116,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter
9117,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Now it is not one thing nor another alone
9118,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Makes a poem, but rather the general tone,"
9119,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The something pervading, uniting, the whole,"
9120,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The before unconceived, unconceivable soul,"
9121,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So that just in removing this trifle or that, you"
9122,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Take away, as it were, a chief limb of the statue;"
9123,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Roots, wood, bark, and leaves, singly perfect may be,"
9124,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, clapt bodge-podge together, they don't make a tree."
9125,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9126,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""But, to come back to Emerson, (whom by the way,"
9127,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I believe we left waiting,)--his is, we may say,"
9128,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A Greek head on right Yankee shoulders, whose range"
9129,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Has Olympus for one pole, for t' other the Exchange;"
9130,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Life, nature, lore, God, and affairs of that sort,"
9131,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He looks at as merely ideas; in short,"
9132,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As if they were fossils stuck round in a cabinet,"
9133,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of such vast extent that our earth's a mere dab in it;
9134,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Composed just as he is inclined to conjecture her,"
9135,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Namely, one part pure earth, ninety-nine parts pure lecturer;"
9136,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You are filled with delight at his clear demonstration,"
9137,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Each figure, word, gesture, just fits the occasion,"
9138,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the quiet precision of science he'll sort em,"
9139,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But you can't help suspecting the whole a post mortem.
9140,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9141,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9142,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,II.  Bryant.
9143,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9144,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""There is Bryant, as quiet, as cool, and as dignified,"
9145,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As a smooth, silent iceberg, that never is ignified,"
9146,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Save when by reflection 'tis kindled o' nights,"
9147,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Nights.
9148,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He may rank (Griswold says so) first bard of your nation,"
9149,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9150,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(There's no doubt that he stands in supreme iceolation,)"
9151,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Your topmost Parnassus he may set his heel on,"
9152,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But no warm applauses come, peal following peal on--"
9153,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He's too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on:
9154,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Unqualified merits, I'll grant, if you choose, he has em,"
9155,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm;
9156,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If he stir you at all, it is just, on my soul,"
9157,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Like being stirred up with the very North Pole.
9158,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9159,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""He is very nice reading in summer, but inter"
9160,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Nos, we don't want extra freezing in winter;"
9161,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Take him up in the depth of July, my advice is,"
9162,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When you feel an Egyptian devotion to ices.
9163,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But, deduct all you can, there's enough that's right good in"
9164,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"him,"
9165,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has a true soul for field, river, and wood in him;"
9166,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And his heart, in the midst of brick walls, or where'er it is,"
9167,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Glows, softens, and thrills with the tenderest charities,"
9168,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To you mortals that delve in this trade-ridden planet?
9169,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"No, to old Berkshire's hills, with their lime stone and"
9170,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,granite.
9171,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9172,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9173,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,III.  Whinier.
9174,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9175,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""There is Whinier, whose swelling and vehement heart"
9176,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Strains the strait-breasted drab of the Quaker apart,"
9177,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And reveals the live Man, still supreme and erect,"
9178,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Underneath the bemummying wrappers of sect;
9179,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,There was ne'er a man born who had more of the swing
9180,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the true lyric bard and all that kind of thing;
9181,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And his failures arise, (though perhaps he don't know it,)"
9182,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the very same cause that has made him a poet,--"
9183,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,A fervor of mind which knows no separation
9184,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Twixt simple excitement and pure inspiration,"
9185,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As my Pythoness erst sometimes erred from not knowing
9186,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,If 'twere I or mere wind through her tripod was blowing;
9187,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Let his mind once get head in its favorite direction
9188,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the torrent of verse bursts the dams of reflection,"
9189,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While, borne with the rush of the metre along,"
9190,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The poet may chance to go right or go wrong,"
9191,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Content with the whirl and delirium of song;
9192,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then his grammar's not always correct, nor his rhymes,"
9193,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And he's prone to repeat his own lyrics sometimes,"
9194,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not his best, though, for those are struck off at white-heats"
9195,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When the heart in his breast like a trip-hammer beats
9196,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And can ne'er be repeated again any more
9197,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Than they could have been carefully plotted before
9198,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""All honor and praise to the right-hearted bard"
9199,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who was true to The Voice when such service was hard,"
9200,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Who himself was so free he dared sing for the slave
9201,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,When to look but a protest in silence was brave;
9202,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9203,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9204,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,IV.  Hawthorne.
9205,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9206,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'There is Hawthorne, with genius so shrinking and rare"
9207,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That you hardly at first see the strength that is there;
9208,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A frame so robust, with a nature so sweet,"
9209,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So earnest, so graceful, so solid, so fleet,"
9210,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Is worth a descent from Olympus to meet;
9211,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Tis as if a rough oak that for ages had stood,"
9212,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With his gnarled bony branches like ribs of the wood
9213,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Should bloom, after cycles of struggle and scathe,"
9214,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,With a single anemone trembly and rathe;
9215,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His strength is so tender; his wildness so meek,"
9216,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That a suitable parallel sets one to seek--
9217,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He's a John Bunyan Fouque, a Puritan Tieck;"
9218,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When nature was shaping him, clay was not granted"
9219,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For making so full-sized a man as she wanted,"
9220,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"So, to fill out her model, a little she spared"
9221,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,From some finer-grained stuff for a woman prepared.
9222,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And she could not have hit a more excellent plan
9223,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For making him fully and perfectly man.
9224,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The success of her scheme gave her so much delight,"
9225,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That she tried it again, shortly after, in Dwight,"
9226,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Only, while she was kneading and shaping the clay,"
9227,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"She sang to her work in her sweet childish way,"
9228,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And found, when she'd put the last touch to his soul,"
9229,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,That the music had somehow got mixed with the whole.
9230,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9231,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9232,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,V.  Cooper.
9233,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9234,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""Here's Cooper, who's written six volumes to show"
9235,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He's as good as a lord: well, let's grant that he's so;"
9236,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If a person prefer that description of praise,"
9237,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, a coronet's certainly cheaper than bays;"
9238,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But he need take no pains to convince us he's not
9239,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,(As his enemies say) the American Scott.
9240,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Choose any twelve men, and let C. read aloud"
9241,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That one of his novels of which he's most proud,"
9242,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And I'd lay any bet that, without ever quitting"
9243,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Their box, they'd be all, to a man, for acquitting."
9244,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He has drawn you he's character, though, that is new,"
9245,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,One wildflower he's plucked that is wet with the dew
9246,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Of this fresh Western world, and, the thing not to mince,"
9247,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He has done naught but copy it ill ever since;
9248,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"His Indians, with proper respect be it said,"
9249,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Are just Natty Bumpo daubed over with red,"
9250,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And his very Long Toms are the same useful Nat,"
9251,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Rigged up in duck pants and a sou'-wester hat,"
9252,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(Though once in a Coffin, a good chance was found"
9253,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,To have slipt the old fellow away underground.)
9254,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,All his other men-figures are clothes upon sticks
9255,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The derniere chemise of a man in a fix,"
9256,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"(As a captain besieged, when his garrison's small,"
9257,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,bets up caps upon poles to be seen o'er the wall;)
9258,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the women he draws from one model don't vary,"
9259,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,All sappy as maples and flat as a prairie.
9260,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"When a character's wanted, he goes to the task"
9261,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As a cooper would do in composing a cask;
9262,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He picks out the staves, of their qualities heedful,"
9263,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Just hoops them together as tight as is needful,"
9264,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, if the best fortune should crown the attempt, he"
9265,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Has made at the most something wooden and empty.
9266,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9267,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""Don't suppose I would underrate Cooper's abilities"
9268,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"If I thought you'd do that, I should feel very ill at ease;"
9269,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The men who have given to one character life
9270,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And objective existence, are not very rife,"
9271,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You may number them all, both prose-writers and singers,"
9272,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Without overrunning the bounds of your fingers,"
9273,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And Natty won't go to oblivion quicker
9274,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Than Adams the parson or Primrose the vicar.
9275,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9276,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""There is one thing in Cooper I like, too, and that is"
9277,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That on manners he lectures his countrymen gratis,"
9278,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Not precisely so either, because, for a rarity,"
9279,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He is paid for his tickets in unpopularity.
9280,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Now he may overcharge his American pictures,"
9281,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But you'll grant there's a good deal of truth in his
9282,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,strictures;
9283,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And I honor the man who is willing to sink
9284,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Half his present repute for the freedom to think,"
9285,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, when he has thought, be his cause strong or weak,"
9286,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Will risk t'other half for the freedom to speak,"
9287,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Caring naught for what vengeance the mob has in store,"
9288,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Let that mob be the upper ten thousand or lower.
9289,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9290,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9291,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,VI.  Poe and Longfellow.
9292,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9293,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""There comes Poe, with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge,"
9294,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge,"
9295,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters,"
9296,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In a way to make people of common-sense damn metres,"
9297,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who has written some things quite the best of their kind,"
9298,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind,"
9299,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Who--but hey-day!  What's this?  Messieurs Mathews and Poe,"
9300,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You mustn't fling mud-balls at Longfellow so,"
9301,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Does it make a man worse that his character's such
9302,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As to make his friends love him (as you thin) too much?
9303,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, there is not a bard at this moment alive"
9304,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"More willing than he that his fellows should thrive,"
9305,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"While you are abusing him thus, even now"
9306,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,He would help either one of you out of a dough;
9307,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,You may say that he's smooth and all that till you're hoarse
9308,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,But remember that elegance also is force;
9309,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"After polishing granite as much as you will,"
9310,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The heart keeps its tough old persistency still;
9311,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Deduct all you can that still keeps you at bay,"
9312,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Why, he'll live till men weary of Collins and Gray."
9313,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9314,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Tis truth that I speak
9315,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Had Theocritus written in English, not Greek,"
9316,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,I believe that his exquisite sense would scarce change a line
9317,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In that rare, tender, virgin-like pastoral Evangeline."
9318,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That's not ancient nor modern, its place is apart"
9319,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Where time has no sway, in the realm of pure Art,"
9320,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,'Tis a shrine of retreat from Earth's hubbub and strife
9321,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As quiet and chaste as the author's own life.
9322,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9323,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9324,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,VII.  Irving.
9325,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9326,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""What!  Irving? thrice welcome, warm heart and fine brain,"
9327,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"You bring back the happiest spirit from Spain,"
9328,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And the gravest sweet humor, that ever were there"
9329,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Since Cervantes met death in his gentle despair;
9330,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Nay, don't be embarrassed, nor look so beseeching,--"
9331,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"I shan't run directly against my own preaching,"
9332,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And, having just laughed at their Raphaels and Dantes,"
9333,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Go to setting you up beside matchless Cervantes;
9334,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"But allow me to speak what I honestly feel,--"
9335,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To a true poet-heart add the fun of Dick Steele,"
9336,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Throw in all of Addison, minus the chill,"
9337,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With the whole of that partnership's stock and good will,"
9338,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Mix well, and while stirring, hum o'er, as a spell,"
9339,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The fine old English Gentleman, simmer it well,"
9340,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Sweeten just to your own private liking, then strain"
9341,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"That only the finest and clearest remain,"
9342,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Let it stand out of doors till a soul it receives
9343,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"From the warm lazy sun loitering down through green leaves,"
9344,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And you'll find a choice nature, not wholly deserving"
9345,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"A name either English or Yankee,--just Irving."
9346,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9347,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9348,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,VIII.  Holmes.
9349,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,

9390,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,
9391,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"""My friends, in the happier days of the muse,"
9392,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"We were luckily free from such things as reviews,"
9393,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then naught came between with its fog to make clearer
9394,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The heart of the poet to that of his hearer;
9395,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then the poet brought heaven to the people, and they"
9396,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Felt that they, too, were poets in hearing his lay;"
9397,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then the poet was prophet, the past in his soul"
9398,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Pre-created the future, both parts of one whole;"
9399,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then for him there was nothing too great or too small.
9400,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,For one natural deity sanctified all;
9401,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then the bard owned no clipper and meter of moods
9402,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Save the spirit of silence that hovers and broods
9403,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O'er the seas and the mountains, the rivers and woods"
9404,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"He asked not earth's verdict, forgetting the clods,"
9405,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,His soul soared and sang to an audience of gods.
9406,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"'Twas for them that he measured the thought and the line,"
9407,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And shaped for their vision the perfect design,"
9408,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"With as glorious a foresight, a balance as true,"
9409,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As swung out the worlds in the infinite blue;
9410,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then a glory and greatness invested man's heart
9411,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"The universal, which now stands estranged and apart,"
9412,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"In the free individual moulded, was Art;"
9413,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Then the forms of the Artist seemed thrilled with desire
9414,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"For something as yet unattained, fuller, higher,"
9415,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"As once with her lips, lifted hands, and eyes listening,"
9416,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And her whole upward soul in her countenance glistening,"
9417,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Eurydice stood--like a beacon unfired,"
9418,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Which, once touched with flame, will leap heav'nward inspired--"
9419,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And waited with answering kindle to mark
9420,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,The first gleam of Orpheus that pained the red Dark.
9421,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"Then painting, song, sculpture, did more than relieve"
9422,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"the need that men feel to create and believe,"
9423,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"And as, in all beauty, who listens with love"
9424,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Hears these words oft repeated--'beyond and above.'
9425,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,So these seemed to be but the visible sign
9426,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,Of the grasp of the soul after things more divine;
9427,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,They were ladders the Artist erected to climb
9428,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"O'er the narrow horizon of space and of time,"
9429,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,And we see there the footsteps by which men had gained
9430,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,"To the one rapturous glimpse of the never-attained,"
9431,A FABLE FOR CRITICS,As shepherds could erst sometimes trace in the sod

9754,A LOGICAL STORY,That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.
9755,A LOGICAL STORY,
9756,A LOGICAL STORY,"Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,"
9757,A LOGICAL STORY,"There is always somewhere a weakest spot,--"
9758,A LOGICAL STORY,"In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,"
9759,A LOGICAL STORY,"In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,"
9760,A LOGICAL STORY,"In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,--lurking still,"
9761,A LOGICAL STORY,"Find it somewhere you must and will,--"
9762,A LOGICAL STORY,"Above or below, or within or without,--"
9763,A LOGICAL STORY,"And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,"
9764,A LOGICAL STORY,"That a chaise breaks down, but doesn't wear out."
9765,A LOGICAL STORY,
9766,A LOGICAL STORY,"But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,"
9767,A LOGICAL STORY,"With an ""I dew vum,"" or an ""I tell yeou,"")"
9768,A LOGICAL STORY,He would build one shay to beat the taown
9769,A LOGICAL STORY,'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
9770,A LOGICAL STORY,"It should be so built that it couldn' break daown,"
9771,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Fur,"" said the Deacon, ""It's mighty plain"
9772,A LOGICAL STORY,Thut the weakes' place mus' Stan' the strain;
9773,A LOGICAL STORY,"'n' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,"
9774,A LOGICAL STORY,Is only jest
9775,A LOGICAL STORY,"T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."""
9776,A LOGICAL STORY,
9777,A LOGICAL STORY,So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
9778,A LOGICAL STORY,"Where he could find the strongest oak,"
9779,A LOGICAL STORY,"That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,"
9780,A LOGICAL STORY,That was for spokes and floor and sills;
9781,A LOGICAL STORY,He sent for lancewood to make the thins;
9782,A LOGICAL STORY,"The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees."
9783,A LOGICAL STORY,"The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,"
9784,A LOGICAL STORY,But lasts like iron for things like these;
9785,A LOGICAL STORY,"The hubs of logs from the ""Settler's ellum,""--"
9786,A LOGICAL STORY,
9787,A LOGICAL STORY,"Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em,"
9788,A LOGICAL STORY,"Never an axe had seen their chips,"
9789,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the wedges flew from between their lips,"
9790,A LOGICAL STORY,Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
9791,A LOGICAL STORY,"Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,"
9792,A LOGICAL STORY,"Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,"
9793,A LOGICAL STORY,"Steel of the finest, bright and blue;"
9794,A LOGICAL STORY,"Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;"
9795,A LOGICAL STORY,"Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide"
9796,A LOGICAL STORY,Found in the pit when the tanner died.
9797,A LOGICAL STORY,"That was the way he ""put her through."""
9798,A LOGICAL STORY,"""There!"" said the Deacon, ""naow she'll dew!"""
9799,A LOGICAL STORY,
9800,A LOGICAL STORY,"Do! I tell you, I rather guess"
9801,A LOGICAL STORY,"She was a wonder, and nothing less!"
9802,A LOGICAL STORY,"Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,"
9803,A LOGICAL STORY,"Deacon and deaconess dropped away,"
9804,A LOGICAL STORY,Children and grandchildren--where were they?
9805,A LOGICAL STORY,But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay
9806,A LOGICAL STORY,As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day
9807,A LOGICAL STORY,
9808,A LOGICAL STORY,EIGHTEEN HUNDRED;--it came and found
9809,A LOGICAL STORY,The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.
9810,A LOGICAL STORY,Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--
9811,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Hahnsum kerridge"" they called it then."
9812,A LOGICAL STORY,Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--
9813,A LOGICAL STORY,Running as usual; much the same.
9814,A LOGICAL STORY,"Thirty and forty at last arrive,"
9815,A LOGICAL STORY,"And then come fifty, and FIFTY-FIVE."
9816,A LOGICAL STORY,
9817,A LOGICAL STORY,Little of all we value here
9818,A LOGICAL STORY,Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
9819,A LOGICAL STORY,Without both feeling and looking queer.
9820,A LOGICAL STORY,"In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,"
9821,A LOGICAL STORY,So far as I know but a tree and truth.
9822,A LOGICAL STORY,(This is a moral that runs at large;
9823,A LOGICAL STORY,Take it.--You're welcome.--No extra charge.)
9824,A LOGICAL STORY,
9825,A LOGICAL STORY,"FIRST of NOVEMBER,--the Earthquake-day--"
9826,A LOGICAL STORY,"There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,"
9827,A LOGICAL STORY,"A general flavor of mild decay,"
9828,A LOGICAL STORY,"But nothing local, as one may say."
9829,A LOGICAL STORY,"There couldn't be,--for the Deacon's art"
9830,A LOGICAL STORY,Had made it so like in every part
9831,A LOGICAL STORY,That there wasn't a chance for one to start.
9832,A LOGICAL STORY,"For the wheels were just as strong as the thins,"
9833,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the floor was just as strong as the sills,"
9834,A LOGICAL STORY,And the panels just as strong as the floors
9835,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the whipple-tree neither less nor more,"
9836,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,"
9837,A LOGICAL STORY,And spring and axle and hub encore.
9838,A LOGICAL STORY,"And yet, as a whole, it is past a doubt"
9839,A LOGICAL STORY,In another hour it will be worn out!
9840,A LOGICAL STORY,
9841,A LOGICAL STORY,"First of November, 'Fifty-five!"
9842,A LOGICAL STORY,This morning the parson takes a drive.
9843,A LOGICAL STORY,"Now, small boys, get out of the way!"
9844,A LOGICAL STORY,"Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,"
9845,A LOGICAL STORY,"Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay."
9846,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Huddup!"" said the parson.--Off went they."
9847,A LOGICAL STORY,"The parson was working his Sunday's text,--"
9848,A LOGICAL STORY,"Had got to fifthly, and stopped perplexed"
9849,A LOGICAL STORY,At what the--Moses--was coming next.
9850,A LOGICAL STORY,
9851,A LOGICAL STORY,"All at once the horse stood still,"
9852,A LOGICAL STORY,Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.
9853,A LOGICAL STORY,"First a shiver, and then a thrill,"
9854,A LOGICAL STORY,"Then something decidedly like a spill,--"
9855,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the parson was sitting upon a rock,"
9856,A LOGICAL STORY,At half past nine by the meet'n'-house clock--
9857,A LOGICAL STORY,Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!
9858,A LOGICAL STORY,
9859,A LOGICAL STORY,"What do you think the parson found,"
9860,A LOGICAL STORY,When he got up and stared around?
9861,A LOGICAL STORY,"The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,"
9862,A LOGICAL STORY,As if it had been to the mill and ground!
9863,A LOGICAL STORY,"You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,"
9864,A LOGICAL STORY,"How it went to pieces all at once,"
9865,A LOGICAL STORY,"All at once, and nothing first,"
9866,A LOGICAL STORY,Just as bubbles do when they burst.
9867,A LOGICAL STORY,
9868,A LOGICAL STORY,End of the wonderful one-boss shay.
9869,A LOGICAL STORY,Logic is logic.  That's all I say.

9970,DRIFTING,"Through deeps below,"
9971,DRIFTING,A duplicated golden glow.
9972,DRIFTING,
9973,DRIFTING,"Far, vague, and dim,"

9975,DRIFTING,"While an Vesuvius' misty brim,"
9976,DRIFTING,"With outstretched hands,"
9977,DRIFTING,The gray smoke stands
9978,DRIFTING,O'erlooking the volcanic lands.
9979,DRIFTING,

9997,DRIFTING,"At peace I lie,"

10001,DRIFTING,"The day, so mild,"
