89,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE
90,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
91,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
92,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,In the dawn of the day when the sea and the earth
93,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Reflected the sunrise above,"
94,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,I set forth with a heart full of courage and mirth
95,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,To seek for the Kingdom of Love.
96,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,I asked of a Poet I met on the way
97,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,Which cross-road would lead me aright;
98,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"And he said ""Follow me, and ere long you shall see"
99,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Its glittering turrets of light."""
100,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
101,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,And soon in the distance a city shone fair.
102,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"""Look yonder,"" he said; ""How it gleams!"""
103,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"But alas! for the hopes that were doomed to despair,"
104,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"It was only the ""Kingdom of Dreams."""
105,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Then the next man I asked was a gay Cavalier,"
106,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"And he said: ""Follow me, follow me"";"
107,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,And with laughter and song we went speeding along
108,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,By the shores of Life's beautiful sea.
109,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
110,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,Then we came to a valley more tropical far
111,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Than the wonderful vale of Cashmere,"
112,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,And I saw from a bower a face like a flower
113,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,Smile out on the gay Cavalier;
114,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"And he said: ""We have come to humanity's goal:"
115,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Here love and delight are intense."""
116,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,But alas and alas! for the hopes of my soul--
117,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"It was only the ""Kingdom of Sense."""
118,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
119,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,As I journeyed more slowly I met on the road
120,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,A coach with retainers behind;
121,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"And they said: ""Follow me, for our Lady's abode"
122,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"Belongs in that realm, you will find."""
123,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"'Twas a grand dame of fashion, a newly-made bride,"
124,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"I followed, encouraged and bold;"
125,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"But my hopes died away like the last gleams of day,"
126,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"For we came to the ""Kingdom of Gold."""
127,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
128,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,At the door of a cottage I asked a fair maid.
129,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"""I have heard of that realm,"" she replied;"
130,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"""But my feet never roam from the 'Kingdom of Home,'"
131,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"So I know not the way,"" and she sighed."
132,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,I looked on the cottage; how restful it seemed!
133,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,And the maid was as fair as a dove.
134,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,Great light glorified my soul as I cried:
135,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,"""Why, _Home_ is the 'Kingdom of Love'!"""
136,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
137,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,
138,THE KINGDOM OF LOVE,

140,MEG'S CURSE,MEG'S CURSE
141,MEG'S CURSE,
142,MEG'S CURSE,
143,MEG'S CURSE,The sun rode high in a cloudless sky
144,MEG'S CURSE,Of a perfect summer morn.
145,MEG'S CURSE,"She stood and gazed out into the street,"
146,MEG'S CURSE,And wondered why she was born.
147,MEG'S CURSE,On the topmost branch of a maple-tree
148,MEG'S CURSE,"That close by the window grew,"
149,MEG'S CURSE,A robin called to his mate enthralled:
150,MEG'S CURSE,"""I love but you, but you, but you."""
151,MEG'S CURSE,
152,MEG'S CURSE,A soft look came in her hardened face--
153,MEG'S CURSE,She had not wept for years;
154,MEG'S CURSE,"But the robin's trill, as some sounds will,"
155,MEG'S CURSE,Jarred open the door of tears.
156,MEG'S CURSE,She thought of the old home far away;
157,MEG'S CURSE,She heard the whr-r-r of the mill;
158,MEG'S CURSE,"She heard the turtle's wild, sweet call,"
159,MEG'S CURSE,"And the wail of the whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will."
160,MEG'S CURSE,
161,MEG'S CURSE,She saw again that dusty road
162,MEG'S CURSE,Whence he came riding down;
163,MEG'S CURSE,She smelled once more the flower she wore
164,MEG'S CURSE,In the breast of her simple gown.
165,MEG'S CURSE,Out on the new-mown meadow she heard
166,MEG'S CURSE,"Two blue-jays quarrel and fret,"
167,MEG'S CURSE,And the warning cry of a Phoebe bird
168,MEG'S CURSE,"""More wet, more wet, more wet."""
169,MEG'S CURSE,
170,MEG'S CURSE,"With a blithe ""Hello"" to the men below"
171,MEG'S CURSE,"Who were spreading the new-mown hay,"
172,MEG'S CURSE,The rider drew rein at her window-pane--
173,MEG'S CURSE,How it all came back to-day!
174,MEG'S CURSE,"How young she was, and how fair she was;"
175,MEG'S CURSE,What innocence crowned her brow!
176,MEG'S CURSE,"The future seemed fair, for Love was there--"
177,MEG'S CURSE,And now--and now--and now.
178,MEG'S CURSE,
179,MEG'S CURSE,In a dingy glass on the wall near by
180,MEG'S CURSE,She gazed on her faded face.
181,MEG'S CURSE,"""Well, Meg, I declare, what a beauty you are!"
182,MEG'S CURSE,"She sneered, ""What an angel of grace!"
183,MEG'S CURSE,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
184,MEG'S CURSE,"What a thing of beauty and grace!"""
185,MEG'S CURSE,She reached out her arms with a moaning sob:
186,MEG'S CURSE,"""Oh, if I could go back!"""
187,MEG'S CURSE,"Then, swift and strange, came a sudden change;"
188,MEG'S CURSE,Her brow grew hard and black.
189,MEG'S CURSE,
190,MEG'S CURSE,"""A curse on the day and a curse on that man,"
191,MEG'S CURSE,"And on all who are his,"" she cried;"
192,MEG'S CURSE,"""May he starve and be cold, may he live to be old"
193,MEG'S CURSE,"When all who loved him have died."""
194,MEG'S CURSE,Her wild voice frightened the robin away
195,MEG'S CURSE,From the branch by the window-sill;
196,MEG'S CURSE,"And little he knew as away he flew,"
197,MEG'S CURSE,Of the memories stirred by his trill.
198,MEG'S CURSE,
199,MEG'S CURSE,"He called to his mate on the grass below,"
200,MEG'S CURSE,"""Follow me,"" as he soared on high;"
201,MEG'S CURSE,And as mates have done since the world begun
202,MEG'S CURSE,"She followed, and asked not why."
203,MEG'S CURSE,The dingy room seemed curtained with gloom;
204,MEG'S CURSE,Meg shivered with nameless dread.
205,MEG'S CURSE,The ghost of her youth and her murdered truth
206,MEG'S CURSE,Seemed risen up from the dead.
207,MEG'S CURSE,
208,MEG'S CURSE,"She hurried out into the noisy street,"
209,MEG'S CURSE,For the silence made her afraid;
210,MEG'S CURSE,"To flee from thought was all she sought,"
211,MEG'S CURSE,She cared not whither she strayed.
212,MEG'S CURSE,Still on she pressed in her wild unrest
213,MEG'S CURSE,"Up avenues skirting the park,"
214,MEG'S CURSE,Where fashion's throng moved gayly along
215,MEG'S CURSE,In Vanity Fair--when hark!
216,MEG'S CURSE,
217,MEG'S CURSE,"A clatter of hoofs down the stony street,"
218,MEG'S CURSE,The snort of a frightened horse
219,MEG'S CURSE,"That was running wild, and a laughing child"
220,MEG'S CURSE,At play in its very course.
221,MEG'S CURSE,With one swift glance Meg saw it all.
222,MEG'S CURSE,"""_His_ child--my God! _his_ child!"""
223,MEG'S CURSE,"She cried aloud, as she rushed through the crowd"
224,MEG'S CURSE,Like one grown suddenly wild.
225,MEG'S CURSE,
226,MEG'S CURSE,"There, almost under the iron feet,"
227,MEG'S CURSE,"Hemmed in by a passing cart,"
228,MEG'S CURSE,Stood the baby boy--the pride and joy
229,MEG'S CURSE,Of the man who had broken her heart.
230,MEG'S CURSE,Past swooning women and shouting men
231,MEG'S CURSE,She fled like a flash of light;
232,MEG'S CURSE,With her slender arm she gathered from harm
233,MEG'S CURSE,The form of the laughing sprite.
234,MEG'S CURSE,
235,MEG'S CURSE,The death-shod feet of the mad horse beat
236,MEG'S CURSE,Her down on the pavings grey;
237,MEG'S CURSE,"But the baby laughed out with a merry shout,"
238,MEG'S CURSE,And thought it splendid play.
239,MEG'S CURSE,"He pulled her gown and called to her: ""Say,"
240,MEG'S CURSE,"Dit up and do dat some more,"
241,MEG'S CURSE,Das jus' ze way my papa play
242,MEG'S CURSE,"Wiz me on ze nursery floor."""
243,MEG'S CURSE,
244,MEG'S CURSE,"When the frightened father reached the scene,"
245,MEG'S CURSE,His boy looked up and smiled
246,MEG'S CURSE,"From the stiffening fold of the arm, death-cold,"
247,MEG'S CURSE,"Of Meg, who had died for his child."
248,MEG'S CURSE,Oh! idle words are a woman's curse
249,MEG'S CURSE,Who loves as woman can;
250,MEG'S CURSE,"For put to the test, she will bare her breast"
251,MEG'S CURSE,And die for the sake of the man.
252,MEG'S CURSE,

256,SOLITUDE,SOLITUDE
257,SOLITUDE,
258,SOLITUDE,
259,SOLITUDE,"Laugh, and the world laughs with you:"
260,SOLITUDE,"Weep, and you weep alone;"
261,SOLITUDE,For the sad old earth
262,SOLITUDE,"Must borrow its mirth,"
263,SOLITUDE,It has trouble enough of its own.
264,SOLITUDE,
265,SOLITUDE,"Sing, and the hills will answer;"
266,SOLITUDE,"Sigh, it is lost on the air;"
267,SOLITUDE,The echoes bound
268,SOLITUDE,"To a joyful sound,"
269,SOLITUDE,But shrink from voicing care.
270,SOLITUDE,
271,SOLITUDE,"Rejoice, and men will seek you;"
272,SOLITUDE,"Grieve, and they turn and go;"
273,SOLITUDE,They want full measure
274,SOLITUDE,"Of all your pleasure,"
275,SOLITUDE,But they do not want your woe.
276,SOLITUDE,
277,SOLITUDE,"Be glad, and your friends are many;"
278,SOLITUDE,"Be sad, and you lose them all;"
279,SOLITUDE,There are none to decline
280,SOLITUDE,"Your nectared wine,"
281,SOLITUDE,But alone you must drink life's gall.
282,SOLITUDE,
283,SOLITUDE,"Feast, and your halls are crowded;"
284,SOLITUDE,"Fast, and the world goes by;"
285,SOLITUDE,"Succeed and give,"
286,SOLITUDE,"And it helps you live,"
287,SOLITUDE,But it cannot help you die.
288,SOLITUDE,
289,SOLITUDE,There is room in the halls of pleasure
290,SOLITUDE,For a long and lordly train;
291,SOLITUDE,But one by one
292,SOLITUDE,We must all file on
293,SOLITUDE,Through the narrow aisles of pain.

299,THE GOSSIPS,
300,THE GOSSIPS,
301,THE GOSSIPS,"A rose in my garden, the sweetest and fairest,"
302,THE GOSSIPS,Was hanging her head through the long golden hours;
303,THE GOSSIPS,"And early one morning I saw her tears falling,"
304,THE GOSSIPS,And heard a low gossiping talk in the bowers.
305,THE GOSSIPS,"The yellow Nasturtium, a spinster all faded,"
306,THE GOSSIPS,Was telling a Lily what ailed the poor Rose:
307,THE GOSSIPS,"""That wild roving Bee who was hanging about her,"
308,THE GOSSIPS,"Has jilted her squarely, as every one knows."
309,THE GOSSIPS,
310,THE GOSSIPS,"""I knew when he came, with his singing and sighing,"
311,THE GOSSIPS,"His airs and his speeches so fine and so sweet,"
312,THE GOSSIPS,"Just how it would end; but no one would believe me,"
313,THE GOSSIPS,"For all were quite ready to fall at his feet."""
314,THE GOSSIPS,"""Indeed, you are wrong,"" said the Lily-belle proudly,"
315,THE GOSSIPS,"""I cared nothing for him; he called on me once,"
316,THE GOSSIPS,"And would have come often, no doubt, if I'd asked him,"
317,THE GOSSIPS,"But though he was handsome, I thought him a dunce."""
318,THE GOSSIPS,
319,THE GOSSIPS,"""Now, now, that's not true,"" cried the tall Oleander."
320,THE GOSSIPS,"""He has travelled and seen every flower that grows;"
321,THE GOSSIPS,"And one who has supped in the garden of princes,"
322,THE GOSSIPS,"We all might have known would not we with the Rose."""
323,THE GOSSIPS,"""But wasn't she proud when he showed her attention?"
324,THE GOSSIPS,"And she let him caress her,"" said sly Mignonette;"
325,THE GOSSIPS,"""And I used to see it and blush for her folly."
326,THE GOSSIPS,"The silly thing thinks he will come to her yet."""
327,THE GOSSIPS,
328,THE GOSSIPS,"""I thought he was splendid,"" said pretty pert Larkspur,"
329,THE GOSSIPS,"""So dark, and so grand with that gay cloak of gold;"
330,THE GOSSIPS,"But he tried once to kiss me, the impudent fellow!"
331,THE GOSSIPS,"And I got offended; I thought him too bold."""
332,THE GOSSIPS,"""Oh, fie!"" laughed the Almond, ""that does for a story."
333,THE GOSSIPS,"Though I hang down my head, yet I see all that goes;"
334,THE GOSSIPS,"And I saw you reach out trying hard to detain him,"
335,THE GOSSIPS,But he just tapped your cheek and flew by to the Rose.
336,THE GOSSIPS,
337,THE GOSSIPS,"""He cared nothing for her; he only was flirting"
338,THE GOSSIPS,"To while away time, as I very well knew;"
339,THE GOSSIPS,"So I turned a cold shoulder on all his advances,"
340,THE GOSSIPS,"Because I was certain his heart was untrue."""
341,THE GOSSIPS,"""The Rose is served right for her folly in trusting"
342,THE GOSSIPS,"An oily-tongued stranger,"" quoth proud Columbine."
343,THE GOSSIPS,"""I knew what he was, and thought once I would warn her,"
344,THE GOSSIPS,"But of course the affair was no business of mine."""
345,THE GOSSIPS,
346,THE GOSSIPS,"""Oh, well,"" cried the Peony, shrugging her shoulders,"
347,THE GOSSIPS,"""I saw all along that the Bee was a flirt;"
348,THE GOSSIPS,"But the Rose has been always so praised and so petted,"
349,THE GOSSIPS,"I thought a good lesson would do her no hurt."""
350,THE GOSSIPS,"Just then came the sound of a love-song sung sweetly,"
351,THE GOSSIPS,I saw my proud Rose lifting up her bowed head;
352,THE GOSSIPS,"And the talk of the gossips was hushed in a moment,"
353,THE GOSSIPS,And the flowers all listened to hear what was said.
354,THE GOSSIPS,
355,THE GOSSIPS,"And the dark, handsome Bee, with his cloak o'er his shoulder,"
356,THE GOSSIPS,"Came swift through the sunlight and kissed the sad Rose,"
357,THE GOSSIPS,"And whispered: ""My darling, I've roved the world over,"
358,THE GOSSIPS,"And you are the loveliest flower that grows."""

365,PLATONIC,
366,PLATONIC,"I knew it the first of the summer,"
367,PLATONIC,"I knew it the same at the end,"
368,PLATONIC,"That you and your love were plighted,"
369,PLATONIC,But couldn't you be my friend?
370,PLATONIC,"Couldn't we sit in the twilight,"
371,PLATONIC,Couldn't we walk on the shore
372,PLATONIC,With only a pleasant friendship
373,PLATONIC,"To bind us, and nothing more?"
374,PLATONIC,
375,PLATONIC,There was not a word of folly
376,PLATONIC,"Spoken between us two,"
377,PLATONIC,Though we lingered oft in the garden
378,PLATONIC,Till the roses were wet with dew.
379,PLATONIC,We touched on a thousand subjects--
380,PLATONIC,"The moon and the worlds above,--"
381,PLATONIC,"And our talk was tinctured with science,"
382,PLATONIC,"And everything else, save love."
383,PLATONIC,
384,PLATONIC,A wholly Platonic friendship
385,PLATONIC,You said I had proven to you
386,PLATONIC,Could bind a man and a woman
387,PLATONIC,"The whole long season through,"
388,PLATONIC,"With never a thought of flirting,"
389,PLATONIC,Though both were in their youth
390,PLATONIC,"What would you have said, my lady,"
391,PLATONIC,If you had known the truth!
392,PLATONIC,
393,PLATONIC,"What would you have done, I wonder,"
394,PLATONIC,Had I gone on my knees to you
395,PLATONIC,"And told you my passionate story,"
396,PLATONIC,There in the dusk and the dew?
397,PLATONIC,"My burning, burdensome story,"
398,PLATONIC,Hidden and hushed so long--
399,PLATONIC,My story of hopeless loving--
400,PLATONIC,"Say, would you have thought it wrong?"
401,PLATONIC,
402,PLATONIC,"But I fought with my heart and conquered,"
403,PLATONIC,I hid my wound from sight;
404,PLATONIC,"You were going away in the morning,"
405,PLATONIC,And I said a calm good-night.
406,PLATONIC,"But now when I sit in the twilight,"
407,PLATONIC,Or when I walk by the sea
408,PLATONIC,"That friendship, quite Platonic,"
409,PLATONIC,Comes surging over me.
410,PLATONIC,
411,PLATONIC,And a passionate longing fills me
412,PLATONIC,"For the roses, the dusk, the dew;"
413,PLATONIC,"For the beautiful summer vanished,"
414,PLATONIC,For the moonlight walks--and _you_.

420,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
421,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
422,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,In his great cushioned chair by the fender
423,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"An old man sits dreaming to-night,"
424,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"His withered hands, licked by the tender"
425,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Warm rays of the red anthracite,"
426,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Are folded before him, all listless;"
427,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"His dim eyes are fixed on the blaze,"
428,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,While over him sweeps the resistless
429,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Flood-tide of old days.
430,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
431,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"He hears not the mirth in the hallway,"
432,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"He hears not the sounds of good cheer,"
433,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,That through the old homestead ring alway
434,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,In the glad Christmas-time of the year.
435,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,He heeds not the chime of sweet voices
436,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,As the last gifts are hung on the tree.
437,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,In a long-vanished day he rejoices--
438,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,In his lost Used-to-be.
439,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
440,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,He has gone back across dead Decembers
441,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,To his childhood's fair land of delight;
442,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"And his mother's sweet smile he remembers,"
443,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,As he hangs up his stocking at night.
444,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,He remembers the dream-haunted slumber
445,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,All broken and restless because
446,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Of the visions that came without number
447,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Of dear Santa Claus.
448,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
449,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Again, in his manhood's beginning,"
450,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"He sees himself thrown on the world,"
451,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And into the vortex of sinning
452,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,By Pleasure's strong arms he is hurled.
453,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"He hears the sweet Christmas bells ringing,"
454,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"""Repent ye, repent ye, and pray"";"
455,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,But he joins with his comrades in singing
456,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,A bacchanal lay.
457,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
458,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Again he stands under the holly
459,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,With a blushing face lifted to his
460,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"For love has been stronger than folly,"
461,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And has turned him from vice unto bliss;
462,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And the whole world is lit with new glory
463,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"As the sweet vows are uttered again,"
464,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,While the Christmas bells tell the old story
465,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Of peace unto men.
466,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
467,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Again, with his little brood 'round him,"
468,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,He sits by the fair mother-wife;
469,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,He knows that the angels have crowned him
470,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"With the truest, best riches of life;"
471,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"And the hearts of the children, untroubled,"
472,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Are filled with the gay Christmas-tide;
473,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"And the gifts for sweet Maudie are doubled,"
474,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Tis her birthday, beside."
475,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
476,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Again,--ah, dear Jesus, have pity--"
477,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"He finds in the chill, waning day,"
478,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,That one has come home from the city--
479,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Frail Maudie, whom love led astray."
480,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,She lies with her babe on her bosom--
481,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Half-hid by the snow's fleecy spread;
482,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,A bud and a poor trampled blossom--
483,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And both are quite dead.
484,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
485,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,So fair and so fragile! just twenty--
486,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,How mocking the bells sound to-night!
487,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"She starved in this great land of plenty,"
488,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,When she tried to grope back to the light.
489,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Christ. are Thy disciples inhuman,"
490,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Or only for _men_ hast Thou died?
491,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,No mercy is shown to a woman
492,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Who once steps aside.
493,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
494,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Again he leans over the shrouded
495,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,Still form of the mother and wife;
496,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Very lonely the way seems, and clouded,"
497,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,As he looks down the vista of life.
498,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,With the sweet Christmas chimes there is blended
499,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"The knell for a life that is done,"
500,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And he knows that his joys are all ended
501,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,And his waiting begun.
502,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
503,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"So long have the years been, so lonely,"
504,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,As he counts them by Christmases gone.
505,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"""I am homesick,"" he murmurs; ""if only"
506,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,The Angel would lead the way on.
507,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"I am cold, in this chill winter weather;"
508,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Why, Maudie, dear, where have you been?"
509,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"And you, too, sweet wife--and together--"
510,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"O Christ, let me in"""
511,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,
512,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"The children ran in from the hallway,"
513,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"""Were you calling us, grandpa?"" they said."
514,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"Then shrank, with that fear that comes alway"
515,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,When young eyes look their first on the dead.
516,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,The freedom so longed for is given.
517,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,The children speak low and draw near:
518,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"""Dear grandpa keeps Christmas in Heaven"
519,GRANDPA'S CHRISTMAS,"With grandma, this year."""

528,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,The ball I wrote was to be;
529,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And oh! it was perfectly splendid--
530,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,If you _could_ have been here to see.
531,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,I've a thousand things to write you
532,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"That I know you are wanting to hear,"
533,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And one, that is sure to delight you--"
534,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"I am wearing Joe's diamond, my dear!"
535,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
536,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Yes, mamma is quite ecstatic"
537,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,That I am engaged to Joe;
538,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"She thinks I am rather erratic,"
539,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And feared that I might say ""No."""
540,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"But, Mabel, I'm twenty-seven"
541,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"(Though nobody _dreams_ it, dear),"
542,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And a fortune like Joe's isn't given
543,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,To lay at one's feet each year.
544,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
545,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,You know my old fancy for Harry--
546,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Or, at least, I am certain you guessed"
547,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,That it took all my sense not to marry
548,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And go with that fellow out west.
549,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,But that was my very first season--
550,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And Harry was poor as could be,"
551,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And mamma's good practical reason
552,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,Took all the romance out of me.
553,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
554,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"She whisked me off over the ocean,"
555,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And had me presented at court,"
556,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And got me all out of the notion
557,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,That ranch life out west was my forte.
558,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,Of course I have never repented--
559,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,I'm not such a goose of a thing;
560,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,But after I had consented
561,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,To Joe--and he gave me the ring--
562,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
563,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,I felt such a queer sensation.
564,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"I seemed to go into a trance,"
565,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Away from the music's pulsation,"
566,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,Away from the lights and the dance.
567,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And the wind o'er the wild prairie
568,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Seemed blowing strong and free,"
569,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And it seemed not Joe, but Harry"
570,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,Who was standing there close to me.
571,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
572,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And the funniest feverish feeling
573,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Went up from my feet to my head,"
574,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,With little chills after it stealing--
575,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And my hands got as numb as the dead.
576,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"A moment, and then it was over:"
577,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"The diamond blazed up in my eyes,"
578,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,And I saw in the face of my lover
579,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"A questioning, strange surprise."
580,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,
581,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Maybe 'twas the scent of the flowers,"
582,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"That heavy with fragrance bloomed near,"
583,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,But I didn't feel natural for hours;
584,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"It was odd now, wasn't it, dear?"
585,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Write soon to your fortunate Clara,"
586,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"Who has carried the prize away,"
587,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,"And say you'll come on when I marry,--"
588,AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT,I think it will happen in May.

905,THE SUICIDE,
906,THE SUICIDE,
907,THE SUICIDE,Vast was the wealth I carried in life's pack--
908,THE SUICIDE,"Youth, health, ambition, hope and trust; but Time"
909,THE SUICIDE,"And Fate, those robbers fit for any crime,"
910,THE SUICIDE,"Stole all, and left me but the empty sack."
911,THE SUICIDE,Before me lay a long and lonely track
912,THE SUICIDE,Of darkling hills and barren steeps to climb;
913,THE SUICIDE,Behind me lay in shadows the sublime
914,THE SUICIDE,Lost lands of Love's delight.  Alack!  Alack!
915,THE SUICIDE,
916,THE SUICIDE,"Unwearied, and with springing steps elate,"
917,THE SUICIDE,I had conveyed my wealth along the road.
918,THE SUICIDE,The empty sack proved now a heavier load:
919,THE SUICIDE,I was borne down beneath its worthless weight.
920,THE SUICIDE,"I stumbled on, and knocked at Death's dark gate."
921,THE SUICIDE,There was no answer.  Stung by sorrow's goad
922,THE SUICIDE,"I _forced_ my way into that grim abode,"
923,THE SUICIDE,"And laughed, and flung Life's empty sack to Fate."
924,THE SUICIDE,
925,THE SUICIDE,Unknown and uninvited I passed in
926,THE SUICIDE,"To that strange land that hangs between two goals,"
927,THE SUICIDE,Round which a dark and solemn river rolls--
928,THE SUICIDE,More dread its silence than the loud earth's din.
929,THE SUICIDE,"And now, where was the peace I hoped to win?"
930,THE SUICIDE,"Black-masted ships slid past me in great shoals,"
931,THE SUICIDE,Their bloody decks thronged with mistaken souls.
932,THE SUICIDE,(God punishes mistakes sometimes like sin.)
933,THE SUICIDE,
934,THE SUICIDE,Not rest and not oblivion I found.
935,THE SUICIDE,My suffering self dwelt with me just the same;
936,THE SUICIDE,"But here no sleep was, and no sweet dreams came"
937,THE SUICIDE,"To give me respite.  Tyrant Death, uncrowned"
938,THE SUICIDE,"By my own hand, still King of Terrors, frowned"
939,THE SUICIDE,"Upon my shuddering soul, that shrank in shame"
940,THE SUICIDE,"Before those eyes where sorrow blent with blame,"
941,THE SUICIDE,And those accusing lips that made no sound.
942,THE SUICIDE,
943,THE SUICIDE,What gruesome shapes dawned on my startled sight
944,THE SUICIDE,What awful sighs broke on my listening ear!
945,THE SUICIDE,"The anguish of the earth, augmented here"
946,THE SUICIDE,"A thousand-fold, made one continuous night."
947,THE SUICIDE,The sack I flung away in impious spite
948,THE SUICIDE,"Hung yet upon me, filled, I saw in fear."
949,THE SUICIDE,"With tears that rained from earth's adjacent sphere,"
950,THE SUICIDE,And turned to stones in falling from that height.
951,THE SUICIDE,
952,THE SUICIDE,"And close about me pressed a grieving throng,"
953,THE SUICIDE,"Each with his heavy sack, which bowed him so"
954,THE SUICIDE,"His face was hidden.  One of these mourned: ""Know"
955,THE SUICIDE,Who enters here but finds the way more long
956,THE SUICIDE,To those fair realms where sounds the angels' song.
957,THE SUICIDE,There is no man-made exit out of woe;
958,THE SUICIDE,Ye cannot dash the locked door down and go
959,THE SUICIDE,"To claim thy rightful joy through paths of wrong."""
960,THE SUICIDE,
961,THE SUICIDE,"He passed into the shadows dim and grey,"
962,THE SUICIDE,And left me to pursue my path alone.
963,THE SUICIDE,With terror greater than I yet had known.
964,THE SUICIDE,"Hard on my soul the awful knowledge lay,"
965,THE SUICIDE,Death had not ended life nor found God's way;
966,THE SUICIDE,"But, with my same sad sorrows still my own,"
967,THE SUICIDE,"Where by-roads led to by-roads, thistle-sown,"
968,THE SUICIDE,I had but wandered off and gone astray.
969,THE SUICIDE,
970,THE SUICIDE,"With earth still near enough to hear its sighs,"
971,THE SUICIDE,"With heaven afar and hell but just below,"
972,THE SUICIDE,Still on and on my lonely soul must go
973,THE SUICIDE,Until I earn the right to Paradise.
974,THE SUICIDE,"We cannot force our way into God's skies,"
975,THE SUICIDE,Nor rush into the rest we long to know;
976,THE SUICIDE,"But patiently, with bleeding steps and slow"
977,THE SUICIDE,Toil on to where selfhood in Godhood dies.

1013,THE MESSENGER,
1014,THE MESSENGER,"She rose up in the early dawn,"
1015,THE MESSENGER,And white and silently she moved
1016,THE MESSENGER,About the house.  Four men had gone
1017,THE MESSENGER,"To battle for the land they loved,"
1018,THE MESSENGER,"And she, the mother and the wife,"
1019,THE MESSENGER,Waited for tidings from the strife.
1020,THE MESSENGER,How still the house seemed! and her tread
1021,THE MESSENGER,Was like the footsteps of the dead.
1022,THE MESSENGER,
1023,THE MESSENGER,"The long day passed, the dark night came;"
1024,THE MESSENGER,She had not seen a human face.
1025,THE MESSENGER,Some voice spoke suddenly her name.
1026,THE MESSENGER,How loud it echoed in that place
1027,THE MESSENGER,"Where, day by day, no sound was heard"
1028,THE MESSENGER,"But her own footsteps!  ""Bring you word,"""

1038,THE MESSENGER,"""Ay, one is gone!"" he said.  ""Which one?"""
1039,THE MESSENGER,"""Dear lady, he, your eldest son."""
1040,THE MESSENGER,
1041,THE MESSENGER,A deathly pallor shot across
1042,THE MESSENGER,Her withered face; she did not weep.

1049,THE MESSENGER,
1050,THE MESSENGER,She put her hand upon her brow;
1051,THE MESSENGER,"A wild, sharp pain was in her eyes."
1052,THE MESSENGER,"""My husband!  Oh, God, help me now!"""
1053,THE MESSENGER,The soldier heard her shuddering sighs.

1083,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Long, long ago, ere yet our race began,"
1084,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"When earth was empty, waiting still for man,"
1085,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Before the breath of life to him was given
1086,A SERVIAN LEGEND,The angels fell into a strife in heaven.
1087,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1088,A SERVIAN LEGEND,At length one furious demon grasped the sun
1089,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"And sped away as fast as he could run,"
1090,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"And with a ringing laugh of fiendish mirth,"
1091,A SERVIAN LEGEND,He leaped the battlements and fell to earth.
1092,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1093,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Dark was it then in heaven, but light below;"
1094,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"For there the demon wandered to and fro,"
1095,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Tilting aloft upon a slender pole
1096,A SERVIAN LEGEND,The orb of day--the pilfering old soul.
1097,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1098,A SERVIAN LEGEND,The angels wept and wailed; but through the dark
1099,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"The Great Creator's voice cried sternly: ""Hark!"

1101,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Him will I honour in all heaven's sight."""
1102,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1103,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Then over the battlements there dropped another.
1104,A SERVIAN LEGEND,(A shrewder angel well there could not be.)
1105,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Quoth he: ""Behold my love for thee, my brother,"
1106,A SERVIAN LEGEND,For I have left all heaven to stay with thee.
1107,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1108,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""Thy loneliness and wanderings I will share,"
1109,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Thy heavy burden I will help thee bear."""
1110,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""Well said,"" the demon answered, ""and well done,"

1112,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1113,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""Your company will cheer me, it is true,"
1114,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"And I could never think of burdening you."""
1115,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Idly they wandered onward, side by side,"
1116,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Till, by and by, they neared a silvery tide."
1117,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1118,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""Let's bathe,"" the angel suddenly suggested."
1119,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""Agreed,"" the demon answered.  ""I'll go last,"
1120,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Because I needs must leave quite unmolested
1121,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"This tiresome sun, which I will now make fast."
1122,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1123,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"He set the pole well in the sandy turf,"
1124,A SERVIAN LEGEND,And called a jackdaw near to watch the place.
1125,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Meanwhile the angel paddled in the surf,"
1126,A SERVIAN LEGEND,And playfully dared his brother to a race.
1127,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1128,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"They swam around together for a while,"
1129,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"The demon always keeping near his prize,"
1130,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Till presently the angel, with a smile,"
1131,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Proposed a healthful diving exercise.
1132,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1133,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"The demon hesitated.  ""But,"" thought he,"
1134,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"""The jackdaw will inform me with a cry"
1135,A SERVIAN LEGEND,If this good brother tries deceiving me;
1136,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"I will not be outdone by him--not I!"""
1137,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1138,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Down, down they went.  The angel in a trice"
1139,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Rose up again, and swift to shore he sped."
1140,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"The jackdaw shrieked, but lo! a mile of ice"
1141,A SERVIAN LEGEND,The demon found had frozen o'er his head.
1142,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1143,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"He swore an oath, and gathered all his force,"
1144,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"And broke the ice, to see the sun, of course,"
1145,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Held firmly in the radiant angel's hand,"
1146,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Who sailed away toward the heavenly land.
1147,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1148,A SERVIAN LEGEND,He gave pursuit.  Wrath lent speed to his chase;
1149,A SERVIAN LEGEND,All heaven leaned down to watch the exciting race.
1150,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"On, on they came, and still the Evil One"
1151,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Gained on the angel burdened with the sun.
1152,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1153,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"With bated breath and faces white as ghosts,"
1154,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Over the walls leaned heaven's affrighted hosts.
1155,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Up, up, still up, the angel almost spent,"
1156,A SERVIAN LEGEND,Threw one foot forward o'er the battlement.
1157,A SERVIAN LEGEND,
1158,A SERVIAN LEGEND,The demon seized the other with a shout;
1159,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"So fierce his clutch he pulled the bottom out,"
1160,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"As the good angel, fainting, laid the sun"
1161,A SERVIAN LEGEND,"Down by the throne of God, who cried: ""Well done!"

1295,HER LAST LETTER,
1296,HER LAST LETTER,"We have been happy together,"
1297,HER LAST LETTER,"Though under the cloud of sin,"
1298,HER LAST LETTER,But I know that the day approaches
1299,HER LAST LETTER,When my chastening must begin.
1300,HER LAST LETTER,"You have been faithful and tender,"
1301,HER LAST LETTER,"But you will not always be,"
1302,HER LAST LETTER,But I think I had better leave you
1303,HER LAST LETTER,While your thoughts are kind of me.
1304,HER LAST LETTER,
1305,HER LAST LETTER,I know my beauty is fading--
1306,HER LAST LETTER,Sin furrows the fairest brow--
1307,HER LAST LETTER,And I know that your heart will weary
1308,HER LAST LETTER,Of the face you smile on now.
1309,HER LAST LETTER,You will take a bride to your bosom
1310,HER LAST LETTER,After you turn from me;
1311,HER LAST LETTER,"You will sit with your wife in the moonlight,"
1312,HER LAST LETTER,And bold her babe on your knee.
1313,HER LAST LETTER,
1314,HER LAST LETTER,O God!  I never could bear it;
1315,HER LAST LETTER,"It would madden my brain, I know;"
1316,HER LAST LETTER,And so while you love me dearly
1317,HER LAST LETTER,I think I had better go.
1318,HER LAST LETTER,"It is sweeter to feel, my darling--"
1319,HER LAST LETTER,To know as I fall asleep--
1320,HER LAST LETTER,"That some one will mourn me and miss me,"
1321,HER LAST LETTER,"That some one is left to weep,"
1322,HER LAST LETTER,
1323,HER LAST LETTER,"Than to die as I should in the future,"
1324,HER LAST LETTER,"To drop in the street some day,"
1325,HER LAST LETTER,"Unknown, unwept, and forgotten"
1326,HER LAST LETTER,After you cast me away.
1327,HER LAST LETTER,Perhaps the blood of the Saviour
1328,HER LAST LETTER,Can wash my garments clean;
1329,HER LAST LETTER,Perchance I may drink of the waters
1330,HER LAST LETTER,That flow through pastures green.
1331,HER LAST LETTER,
1332,HER LAST LETTER,"Perchance we may meet in heaven,"
1333,HER LAST LETTER,"And walk in the streets above,"
1334,HER LAST LETTER,With nothing to grieve us or part us
1335,HER LAST LETTER,Since our sinning was all through love
1336,HER LAST LETTER,"God says, ""Love one another,"""
1337,HER LAST LETTER,And down to the depths of hell
1338,HER LAST LETTER,Will He send the soul of a woman

1344,HER LAST LETTER,"Or found her beautiful clay,"
1345,HER LAST LETTER,"Lifeless and pallid as marble,"
1346,HER LAST LETTER,For the spirit had flown away.
1347,HER LAST LETTER,The farewell words she had written
1348,HER LAST LETTER,"She held to her cold, white breast,"
1349,HER LAST LETTER,And the buried blade of a dagger
1350,HER LAST LETTER,Told how she had gone to rest.

1405,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,"Who straightway ordered his wedding clothes,"
1406,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,"And paid his tailor, Don Wait-for-aye,"
1407,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,Who died of amazement the self-same day.
1408,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,My lord by a jury was judged insane;

1410,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,That a lord of such very high pedigree
1411,THE PRINCESS'S FINGER-NAIL: A TALE OF NONSENSE LAND,"Would never be paying his bills, you see,"

1426,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"Though I saw no cradle and heard no cry,"
1427,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"But the husband went tiptoeing round like a mouse,"
1428,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,And the good wife was humming a soft lullaby;
1429,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,And there was a look on the face of that mother
1430,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"That I knew could mean only _one_ thing, and no other."
1431,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,
1432,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"""The _mother_,"" I said to myself; for I knew"
1433,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"That the woman before me was certainly that,"
1434,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"For there lay in the corner a tiny cloth shoe,"
1435,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,And I saw on the stand such a wee little hat;
1436,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"And the beard of the husband said plain as could be,"
1437,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"""Two fat, chubby hands have been tugging at me."""
1438,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,
1439,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"And he took from his pocket a gay picture-book,"
1440,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,And a dog that would bark if you pulled on a string;
1441,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,And the wife laid them up with such a pleased look;
1442,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"And I said to myself, ""There is no other thing"

1444,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"That one is in hiding here somewhere, I know."""
1445,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,
1446,A BABY IN THE HOUSE,"I stayed but a moment, and saw nothing more,"

1460,THE FOOLISH ELM,One day where an elm-tree grew.
1461,THE FOOLISH ELM,"""You are fair,"" he said, as she bent down her head,"
1462,THE FOOLISH ELM,"""Too fair for your robe's dull hue."
1463,THE FOOLISH ELM,You are far too young for a garb so old;
1464,THE FOOLISH ELM,Your beauty needs colour and sheen.
1465,THE FOOLISH ELM,"Oh, I would clothe you in scarlet and gold"
1466,THE FOOLISH ELM,Befitting the grace of a queen.
1467,THE FOOLISH ELM,
1468,THE FOOLISH ELM,"""For one little kiss on your lips, sweet elm,"
1469,THE FOOLISH ELM,"For one little kiss, no more,"
1470,THE FOOLISH ELM,"I would give you, I swear, a robe more fair"
1471,THE FOOLISH ELM,Than ever a princess wore.
1472,THE FOOLISH ELM,"One little kiss on those lips, my pet,"
1473,THE FOOLISH ELM,"And lo! you shall stand, I say,"
1474,THE FOOLISH ELM,"Queen of the forest, and, better yet,"
1475,THE FOOLISH ELM,"Queen of my heart alway."""
1476,THE FOOLISH ELM,
1477,THE FOOLISH ELM,"She tossed her head, but he took the kiss--"
1478,THE FOOLISH ELM,'Tis the way of lovers bold--
1479,THE FOOLISH ELM,And a gorgeous dress for that sweet caress

1487,THE FOOLISH ELM,In search of a tree more fair;
1488,THE FOOLISH ELM,And mob-winds tattered her garments and scattered
1489,THE FOOLISH ELM,Her finery here and there.
1490,THE FOOLISH ELM,Poor and faded and ragged and cold
1491,THE FOOLISH ELM,"She rocked in her wild distress,"
1492,THE FOOLISH ELM,And longed for the dull green gown she had sold
1493,THE FOOLISH ELM,For her fickle lover's caress.
1494,THE FOOLISH ELM,
1495,THE FOOLISH ELM,"And the days went by and Winter came,"

1497,THE FOOLISH ELM,"On the shivering tree, whose robes of flame"
1498,THE FOOLISH ELM,He had trampled under his feet.
1499,THE FOOLISH ELM,I saw her reach up to the mocking skies
1500,THE FOOLISH ELM,"Her poor arms, bare and thin;"
1501,THE FOOLISH ELM,"Ah, well-a-day! it is ever the way"
1502,THE FOOLISH ELM,With a woman who trades with sin.

1527,ROBIN'S MISTAKE,
1528,ROBIN'S MISTAKE,"And his head grew light and dizzy,"
1529,ROBIN'S MISTAKE,"And he staggered left and right,"
1530,ROBIN'S MISTAKE,"Tipped over the flask of brandy,"

1663,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"High o'er the clouds a Sunbeam shone,"
1664,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"And far down under him,"
1665,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"With a subtle grace that was all her own,"
1666,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"The Mist gleamed, fair and dim."
1667,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,
1668,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,He looked at her with his burning eyes
1669,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,And longed to fall at her feet;
1670,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"Of all sweet things there under the skies,"
1671,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,He thought her the thing most sweet.
1672,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,
1673,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"He had wooed oft, as a Sunbeam may,"
1674,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"Wave, and blossom, and flower;"
1675,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,But never before had he felt the sway

1681,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,To a heart that is filled with desire?
1682,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,
1683,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"Boldly he trod over cloud and star,"
1684,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"Boldly he swam through space,"
1685,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,She caught the glow of his eyes afar
1686,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,And veiled her delicate face.
1687,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,
1688,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"He was so strong and he was so bright,"
1689,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,And his breath was a breath of flame;
1690,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"The Mist grew pale with a vague, strange fright,"
1691,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"As fond, yet fierce, he came."
1692,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,
1693,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,Close to his heart she was clasped and kissed;
1694,THE RAPE OF THE MIST,"She swooned in love's alarms,"

1702,THE TWO GLASSES,
1703,THE TWO GLASSES,
1704,THE TWO GLASSES,"There sat two glasses, filled to the brim,"
1705,THE TWO GLASSES,"On a rich man's table, rim to rim."
1706,THE TWO GLASSES,"One was ruddy and red as blood,"
1707,THE TWO GLASSES,And one was as clear as the crystal flood.
1708,THE TWO GLASSES,
1709,THE TWO GLASSES,Said the glass of wine to his paler brother:
1710,THE TWO GLASSES,"""Let us tell tales of the past to each other."
1711,THE TWO GLASSES,"I can tell of banquet, and revel, and mirth,"
1712,THE TWO GLASSES,"Where I was king, for I ruled in might;"
1713,THE TWO GLASSES,And the proudest and grandest souls on earth
1714,THE TWO GLASSES,"Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight."
1715,THE TWO GLASSES,From the heads of kings I have torn the crown;
1716,THE TWO GLASSES,From the heights of fame I have hurled men down;
1717,THE TWO GLASSES,I have blasted many an honoured name;
1718,THE TWO GLASSES,I have taken virtue and given shame;
1719,THE TWO GLASSES,"I have tempted the youth, with a sip, a taste,"
1720,THE TWO GLASSES,That has made his future a barren waste.
1721,THE TWO GLASSES,"Far greater than any king am I,"
1722,THE TWO GLASSES,Or than any army under the sky.
1723,THE TWO GLASSES,"I have made the arm of the driver fail,"
1724,THE TWO GLASSES,And sent the train from its iron rail.
1725,THE TWO GLASSES,"I have made good ships go down at sea,"
1726,THE TWO GLASSES,And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me.
1727,THE TWO GLASSES,"Fame, strength, wealth, genius, before me fall,"
1728,THE TWO GLASSES,And my might and power are over all.
1729,THE TWO GLASSES,"Ho! ho! pale brother,"" laughed the wine,"
1730,THE TWO GLASSES,"""Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?"""
1731,THE TWO GLASSES,
1732,THE TWO GLASSES,"Said the glass of water: ""I cannot boast"
1733,THE TWO GLASSES,Of a king dethroned or a murdered host;
1734,THE TWO GLASSES,"But I can tell of hearts that were sad,"
1735,THE TWO GLASSES,By my crystal drops made light and glad;
1736,THE TWO GLASSES,"Of thirsts I have quenched, and brows I have laved;"
1737,THE TWO GLASSES,Of hands I have cooled and souls I have saved.
1738,THE TWO GLASSES,I have leaped through the valley and dashed down the mountain;
1739,THE TWO GLASSES,Slept in the sunshine and dripped from the fountain.
1740,THE TWO GLASSES,"I have burst my cloud-fetters and dropped from the sky,"
1741,THE TWO GLASSES,And everywhere gladdened the landscape and eye.
1742,THE TWO GLASSES,I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain;
1743,THE TWO GLASSES,I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain;
1744,THE TWO GLASSES,"I can tell of the powerful wheel o' the mill,"
1745,THE TWO GLASSES,That ground out the flour and turned at my will;
1746,THE TWO GLASSES,"I can tell of manhood, debased by you,"
1747,THE TWO GLASSES,That I have uplifted and crowned anew.
1748,THE TWO GLASSES,"I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,"
1749,THE TWO GLASSES,I gladden the heart of man and maid;
1750,THE TWO GLASSES,"I set the chained wine-captive free,"
1751,THE TWO GLASSES,"And all are better for knowing me."""
1752,THE TWO GLASSES,
1753,THE TWO GLASSES,"These are the tales they told each other,"
1754,THE TWO GLASSES,"The glass of wine and its paler brother,"

1761,THE MANIAC,THE MANIAC
1762,THE MANIAC,
1763,THE MANIAC,
1764,THE MANIAC,I saw them sitting in the shade;
1765,THE MANIAC,"The long green vines hung over,"
1766,THE MANIAC,But could not hide the gold-haired maid
1767,THE MANIAC,"And Earl, my dark-eyed lover."
1768,THE MANIAC,"His arm was clasped so close, so close,"
1769,THE MANIAC,"Her eyes were softly lifted,"
1770,THE MANIAC,While his eyes drank the cheek of rose
1771,THE MANIAC,And breasts like snowflakes drifted.
1772,THE MANIAC,
1773,THE MANIAC,A strange noise sounded in my brain;
1774,THE MANIAC,I was a guest unbidden.
1775,THE MANIAC,"I stole away, but came again"
1776,THE MANIAC,With two knives snugly hidden.
1777,THE MANIAC,"I stood behind them.  Close they kissed,"
1778,THE MANIAC,While eye to eye was speaking;
1779,THE MANIAC,"I aimed my steels, and neither missed"
1780,THE MANIAC,The heart I sent it seeking.
1781,THE MANIAC,
1782,THE MANIAC,There were two death-shrieks mingled so
1783,THE MANIAC,"It seemed like one voice crying,"
1784,THE MANIAC,"I laughed--it was such bliss, you know,"
1785,THE MANIAC,To hear and see them dying.
1786,THE MANIAC,I laughed and shouted while I stood
1787,THE MANIAC,"Above the lovers, gazing"
1788,THE MANIAC,Upon the trickling rills of blood
1789,THE MANIAC,And frightened eyes fast glazing.
1790,THE MANIAC,
1791,THE MANIAC,It was such joy to see the rose
1792,THE MANIAC,Fade from her cheek for ever;
1793,THE MANIAC,To know the lips he kissed so close
1794,THE MANIAC,"Could answer never, never."
1795,THE MANIAC,"To see his arm grow stark and cold,"
1796,THE MANIAC,And know it could not hold her;
1797,THE MANIAC,To know that while the world grew old
1798,THE MANIAC,His eyes could not behold her.
1799,THE MANIAC,
1800,THE MANIAC,"A crowd of people thronged about,"
1801,THE MANIAC,Brought thither by my laughter;
1802,THE MANIAC,I gave one last triumphant shout--
1803,THE MANIAC,Then darkness followed after.
1804,THE MANIAC,That was a thousand years ago;
1805,THE MANIAC,"Each hour I live it over,"
1806,THE MANIAC,"For there, just out of reach, you know,"
1807,THE MANIAC,"_She_ lies, with Earl, my lover."
1808,THE MANIAC,
1809,THE MANIAC,"They lie there, staring, staring so"
1810,THE MANIAC,"With great, glazed eyes to taunt me."
1811,THE MANIAC,"Will no one bury them down low,"
1812,THE MANIAC,Where they shall cease to haunt me?
1813,THE MANIAC,"He kissed her lips, not mine; the flowers"
1814,THE MANIAC,And vines hung all about them.
1815,THE MANIAC,Sometimes I sit and laugh for hours
1816,THE MANIAC,To think just how I found them.
1817,THE MANIAC,
1818,THE MANIAC,And then I sometimes stand and shriek
1819,THE MANIAC,In agony of terror:
1820,THE MANIAC,"I see the red warm in her cheek,"
1821,THE MANIAC,Then laugh loud at my error.
1822,THE MANIAC,"My cheek was all too pale, he thought;"
1823,THE MANIAC,He deemed hers far the brightest.
1824,THE MANIAC,Ha! but my dagger touched a spot
1825,THE MANIAC,That made _her_ face the whitest!
1826,THE MANIAC,
1827,THE MANIAC,"But oh! the days seem very long,"
1828,THE MANIAC,"Without my Earl, my lover;"
1829,THE MANIAC,And something in my head seems wrong
1830,THE MANIAC,The more I think it over.
1831,THE MANIAC,Ah! look--she is not dead--look there!
1832,THE MANIAC,She's standing close beside me!
1833,THE MANIAC,Her eyes are open--how they stare!
1834,THE MANIAC,"Oh, hide me! hide me! hide me!"

2055,HOW SALVATOR WON,"The gate was thrown open, I rode out alone,"
2056,HOW SALVATOR WON,More proud than a monarch who sits on a throne.
2057,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I am but a jockey, yet shout upon shout"
2058,HOW SALVATOR WON,Went up from the people who watched me ride out;
2059,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd,"
2060,HOW SALVATOR WON,Were as earnest as those to which monarch e'er bowed.
2061,HOW SALVATOR WON,
2062,HOW SALVATOR WON,My heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain
2063,HOW SALVATOR WON,As I patted my Salvator's soft silken mane;
2064,HOW SALVATOR WON,And a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand
2065,HOW SALVATOR WON,As we passed by the multitude down to the stand.
2066,HOW SALVATOR WON,
2067,HOW SALVATOR WON,"The great waves of cheering came billowing back,"
2068,HOW SALVATOR WON,As the hoofs of brave Tenny rang swift down the track;
2069,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle,"
2070,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Our noble opponent, well trained for the tussle"
2071,HOW SALVATOR WON,"That waited us there on the smooth, shining course."
2072,HOW SALVATOR WON,"My Salvator, fair to the lovers of horse,"
2073,HOW SALVATOR WON,As a beautiful woman is fair to man's sight--
2074,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Pure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright,--"
2075,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Stood taking the plaudits as only his due,"
2076,HOW SALVATOR WON,And nothing at all unexpected or new.
2077,HOW SALVATOR WON,
2078,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And then, there before us the bright flag is spread,"
2079,HOW SALVATOR WON,"There's a roar from the grand stand, and Tenny's ahead;"
2080,HOW SALVATOR WON,"At the sound of the voices that shouted ""a go!"""
2081,HOW SALVATOR WON,He sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow.
2082,HOW SALVATOR WON,I tighten the reins on Prince Charlie's great son--
2083,HOW SALVATOR WON,"He is off like a rocket, the race is begun."
2084,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Half-way down the furlong, their heads are together,"
2085,HOW SALVATOR WON,Scarce room 'twixt their noses to wedge in a feather;
2086,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Past grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife,"
2087,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Ah, Salvator, boy! 'tis the race of your life."
2088,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I press my knees closer, I coax him, I urge,"
2089,HOW SALVATOR WON,I feel him go out with a leap and a surge;
2090,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride,"
2091,HOW SALVATOR WON,"While backward, still backward, falls Tenny beside."
2092,HOW SALVATOR WON,"We are nearing the turn, the first quarter is past--"
2093,HOW SALVATOR WON,'Twixt leader and chaser the daylight is cast.
2094,HOW SALVATOR WON,"The distance elongates, still Tenny sweeps on,"
2095,HOW SALVATOR WON,As graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn;
2096,HOW SALVATOR WON,"His awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained--"
2097,HOW SALVATOR WON,"A noble opponent, well born and well trained."
2098,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I glanced o'er my shoulder, ha!  Tenny, the cost"
2099,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Of that one's second flagging, will be--the race lost."
2100,HOW SALVATOR WON,"One second's weak yielding of courage and strength,"
2101,HOW SALVATOR WON,And the daylight between us has doubled its length.
2102,HOW SALVATOR WON,
2103,HOW SALVATOR WON,"The first mile is covered, the race is mine--no!"
2104,HOW SALVATOR WON,For the blue blood of Tenny responds to a blow.
2105,HOW SALVATOR WON,"He shoots through the air like a ball from a gun,"
2106,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And the two lengths between us are shortened to one,"
2107,HOW SALVATOR WON,"My heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump,"
2108,HOW SALVATOR WON,For Tenny's long neck is at Salvator's rump;
2109,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And now with new courage grown bolder and bolder,"
2110,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I see him, once more running shoulder to shoulder."
2111,HOW SALVATOR WON,"With knees, hands, and body I press my grand steed"
2112,HOW SALVATOR WON,"I urge him, I coax him, I pray him to heed!"
2113,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Oh, Salvator!  Salvator! list to my calls,"
2114,HOW SALVATOR WON,For the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls.
2115,HOW SALVATOR WON,There's a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm
2116,HOW SALVATOR WON,As close to my saddle leaps Tenny's great form:
2117,HOW SALVATOR WON,
2118,HOW SALVATOR WON,"One more mighty plunge, and with knee, limb, and hand,"
2119,HOW SALVATOR WON,I lift my horse first by a nose past the stand.
2120,HOW SALVATOR WON,"We are under the string now--the great race is done,"
2121,HOW SALVATOR WON,"And Salvator, Salvator, Salvator won!"
2122,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Cheer, hoar-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, I say."
2123,HOW SALVATOR WON,'Tis the race of a century witnessed to-day!
2124,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Though ye live twice the space that's allotted to men,"
2125,HOW SALVATOR WON,Ye never will see such a grand race again.
2126,HOW SALVATOR WON,Let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf
2127,HOW SALVATOR WON,"For Salvator, Salvator, king of the turf!"
2128,HOW SALVATOR WON,He has broken the record of thirteen long years;
2129,HOW SALVATOR WON,He has won the first place in a vast line of peers.
2130,HOW SALVATOR WON,"'Twas a neck-to-neck contest, a grand, honest race,"
2131,HOW SALVATOR WON,And even his enemies grant him his place.
2132,HOW SALVATOR WON,"Down into the dust let old records be hurled,"
2133,HOW SALVATOR WON,And hang out 2.05 in the gaze of the world.

2371,II,You asked for truth; I answer without shame;
2372,II,"My human heart pulsed blood by night and day,"
2373,II,And I believed that Love had come my way
2374,II,Before he conquered with your face and name.

2376,II,I do not know when first I felt this fire

2387,II,Light as a dewdrop falls from space

2403,II,One time when Autumn donned her robes of splendour
2404,II,"And rustled down the year's receding track,"
2405,II,"As I passed dreaming by, a voice all tender"
2406,II,Haled me with youth's soft call to linger back.
2407,II,I turned and listened to a golden story!
2408,II,"A wondrous tale, half human, half divine--"
2409,II,"A page from bright September's book of glory,"
2410,II,To memorise and make forever mine.
2411,II,Strange argosies from passion's unknown oceans
2412,II,"Cruised down my veins, a vague elusive fleet,"
2413,II,"With foreign cargoes of unnamed emotions,"
2414,II,"While wafts of song blew shoreward, dim and sweet,"
2415,II,And sleeping still (because unwaked by you)
2416,II,"I dreamed and dreamed, and thought my visions true."
2417,II,I woke when all the crimson colour faded
2418,II,And wanton Autumn's lips and cheeks were pale;

2457,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2458,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You women lay stress on your fine perception,"
2459,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Your intuitions are prated about;
2460,A MARRIED COQUETTE,You claim an occult sort of conception
2461,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Of matters which men must reason out.

2463,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"""To call again soon,"" you read my heart."
2464,A MARRIED COQUETTE,I cannot believe you were acting blindly;
2465,A MARRIED COQUETTE,You saw my passion for you from the start.
2466,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2467,A MARRIED COQUETTE,You are one of those women who charm without trying;
2468,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"The clay you are made of is magnet ore,"
2469,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"And I am the steel; yet, there's no denying"
2470,A MARRIED COQUETTE,You led me to loving you more and more.
2471,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You are fanning a flame that may burn too brightly,"
2472,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Oft easily kindled, but hard to put out;"
2473,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"I am not a man to be played with lightly,"
2474,A MARRIED COQUETTE,To come at a gesture and go at a pout.
2475,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2476,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"A brute you call me, a creature inhuman;"
2477,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You say I insult you, and bid me go."
2478,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"And you?  Oh, you are a saintly woman,"
2479,A MARRIED COQUETTE,With thoughts as pure as the drifted snow.
2480,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Pah! you are but one of a thousand beauties
2481,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Who think they are living exemplary lives:
2482,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"They break no commandments, and do all their duties"
2483,A MARRIED COQUETTE,As Christian women and spotless wives.
2484,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2485,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"But with drooping of lids, and lifting of faces,"
2486,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"And baring of shoulders, and well-timed sighs,"
2487,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"And the devil knows what other subtle graces,"
2488,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You are mental wantons, who sin with the eyes."
2489,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You lure love to wake, yet bid it keep under,"
2490,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You tempt us to fall, but bid reason control;"
2491,A MARRIED COQUETTE,And then you are full of an outraged wonder
2492,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"When we get to wanting you, body and soul."
2493,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2494,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Why, look at yourself!  You were no stranger"

2496,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"When you asked me to call you knew my danger,"
2497,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Yet here you are, dressed in the gown I admire;"
2498,A MARRIED COQUETTE,For half of the evil on earth is invented
2499,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"By vain, pretty women with nothing to do"
2500,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"But to keep themselves manicured, powdered, and scented,"

2506,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"On the lips that are free now to cry ""Shame, shame!"""
2507,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"You hate me?  Quite likely!  It does not surprise me,"
2508,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Brute force?  I confess it; _but still you were kissed_;
2509,A MARRIED COQUETTE,And one thing is certain--you cannot despise me
2510,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"For having been played with, controlled, and dismissed."
2511,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2512,A MARRIED COQUETTE,And the next time you see that a man is attracted
2513,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"By the beauty and graces that are not for him,"
2514,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Don't lead him on to be half distracted;
2515,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Keep out of deep waters although you can swim.
2516,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"For when he is caught in the whirlpool of passion,"
2517,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Where many bold swimmers are seen to drown,"
2518,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"A man will reach out and, in desperate fashion,"
2519,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Will drag whoever is nearest him down.
2520,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2521,A MARRIED COQUETTE,Though the strings of his heart may be wrenched and riven
2522,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"By a maiden coquette who has led him along,"
2523,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"She can be pardoned, excused, and forgiven,"
2524,A MARRIED COQUETTE,For innocence blindfolded walks into wrong.
2525,A MARRIED COQUETTE,But she who has willingly taken the fetter
2526,A MARRIED COQUETTE,That Cupid forges at Hymen's command--
2527,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Well, she is the woman who ought to know better;"
2528,A MARRIED COQUETTE,She needs no mercy at any man's hand.
2529,A MARRIED COQUETTE,
2530,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"In the game of hearts, though a woman be winner,"
2531,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"The odds are ever against her, you know;"
2532,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"The world is ready to call her a sinner,"
2533,A MARRIED COQUETTE,And man is ready to make her so.
2534,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"Shame is likely, and sorrow is certain,"
2535,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"And the man has the best of it, end as it may."
2536,A MARRIED COQUETTE,"So now, my lady, we'll drop the curtain,"
2537,A MARRIED COQUETTE,And put out the lights.  We are through with our play.

2598,THE SUMMER GIRL,
2599,THE SUMMER GIRL,She is like a fish in water; she can handle reins and racket;
2600,THE SUMMER GIRL,From head to toe and finger-tips she's thoroughly alive;

2635,THE GHOST,Was the halo round the face
2636,THE GHOST,"Of that ghost that came to me, followed me."
2637,THE GHOST,
2638,THE GHOST,And he wore no shroud or cere-cloth
2639,THE GHOST,"As he wandered at my side, close beside:"

2984,THE GIDDY GIRL,"Declared she would far rather dance than eat,"
2985,THE GIDDY GIRL,And the truth of it came to pass.
2986,THE GIDDY GIRL,For she danced all day and she danced all night;
2987,THE GIDDY GIRL,She danced till the green earth faded white;
2988,THE GIDDY GIRL,She danced ten partners out of breath;
2989,THE GIDDY GIRL,She danced the eleventh one quite to death;
2990,THE GIDDY GIRL,And still she redowaed up and down--
2991,THE GIDDY GIRL,The giddiest girl in town.

2999,THE GIDDY GIRL,She danced her other toes all to a point;
3000,THE GIDDY GIRL,She danced out slipper and boot and shoe;

3186,A PIN,
3187,A PIN,And she is a careful critic; for on yesterday she eyed
3188,A PIN,"The new dress I was airing with a woman's natural pride,"
3189,A PIN,"And she said: ""Oh, how becoming!"" and then softly added, ""It"
3190,A PIN,"Is really a misfortune that the basque is such a fit."""
3191,A PIN,
3192,A PIN,"Then she said: ""If you had heard me yestereve, I'm sure, my friend,"
3193,A PIN,"You would say I am a champion who knows how to defend."""
3194,A PIN,"And she left me with a feeling--most unpleasant, I aver--"
3195,A PIN,That the whole world would despise me if it hadn't been for her.
3196,A PIN,
3197,A PIN,"Whenever I encounter her, in such a nameless way"
3198,A PIN,She gives me the impression I am at my worst that day;
3199,A PIN,And the hat that was imported (and that cost me half a sonnet)
3200,A PIN,With just one glance from her round eyes becomes a Bowery bonnet.
3201,A PIN,
3202,A PIN,"She is always bright and smiling, sharp and shining for a thrust;"
3203,A PIN,"Use does not seem to blunt her point, nor does she gather rust."
3204,A PIN,Oh!  I wish some hapless specimen of mankind would begin
3205,A PIN,"To tidy up the world for me, by picking up this pin."

3210,THE COMING MAN,THE COMING MAN
3211,THE COMING MAN,
3212,THE COMING MAN,
3213,THE COMING MAN,"Oh! not for the great departed,"
3214,THE COMING MAN,"Who formed our country's laws,"
3215,THE COMING MAN,"And not for the bravest-hearted,"
3216,THE COMING MAN,"Who died in freedom's cause,"
3217,THE COMING MAN,And not for some living hero
3218,THE COMING MAN,"To whom all bend the knee,"
3219,THE COMING MAN,My muse would raise her song of praise--
3220,THE COMING MAN,But for the man _to be_.
3221,THE COMING MAN,
3222,THE COMING MAN,For out of the strife which woman
3223,THE COMING MAN,"Is passing through to-day,"
3224,THE COMING MAN,A man that is more than human
3225,THE COMING MAN,"Shall yet be born, I say."
3226,THE COMING MAN,A man in whose pure spirit
3227,THE COMING MAN,No dross of self will lurk;
3228,THE COMING MAN,"A man who is strong to cope with wrong,"
3229,THE COMING MAN,A man who is proud to work.
3230,THE COMING MAN,
3231,THE COMING MAN,"A man with hope undaunted,"
3232,THE COMING MAN,"A man with godlike power,"
3233,THE COMING MAN,"Shall come when he most is wanted,"
3234,THE COMING MAN,Shall come at the needed hour.
3235,THE COMING MAN,He shall silence the din and clamour
3236,THE COMING MAN,"Of clan disputing with clan,"
3237,THE COMING MAN,And toil's long fight with purse-proud might
3238,THE COMING MAN,Shall triumph through this man.
3239,THE COMING MAN,
3240,THE COMING MAN,"I know he is coming, coming,"
3241,THE COMING MAN,"To help, to guide, to save."
3242,THE COMING MAN,"Though I hear no martial drumming,"
3243,THE COMING MAN,And see no flags that wave.
3244,THE COMING MAN,"But the great soul travail of woman,"
3245,THE COMING MAN,"And the bold free thought unfurled,"
3246,THE COMING MAN,Are heralds that say he is on the way--
3247,THE COMING MAN,The coming man of the world.
3248,THE COMING MAN,
3249,THE COMING MAN,"Mourn not for vanished ages,"
3250,THE COMING MAN,"With their great heroic men,"
3251,THE COMING MAN,Who dwell in history's pages
3252,THE COMING MAN,And live in the poet's pen.
3253,THE COMING MAN,"For the grandest times are before us,"
3254,THE COMING MAN,And the world is yet to see
3255,THE COMING MAN,The noblest worth of this old earth
3256,THE COMING MAN,In the men that are to be.
