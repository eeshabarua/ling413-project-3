35,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The verses composing this volume have been selected by the author almost
36,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,entirely from the five-volume edition of his poems published by the
37,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Bobbs-Merrill Company in 1907. A number have been included from the three
38,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,or four volumes which have been published since the appearance of the
39,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Collected Poems; namely, three poems from the volume entitled ""Nature"
40,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Notes and Impressions,"" E. P. Button & Co., New York; one poem from ""The"
41,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Giant and the Star,"" Small, Maynard & Co., Boston; Section VII and part of"
42,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Section VIII of ""An Ode"" written in commemoration of the founding of the"
43,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Massachusetts Bay Colony, and published by John P. Morton & Co.,"
44,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Louisville, Ky.; some five or six poems from ""New Poems,"" published in"
45,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,London by Mr. Grant Richards in 1909; and three or four selections from
46,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the volume of selections entitled ""Kentucky Poems,"" compiled by Mr. Edmund"
47,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Gosse and published in London by Mr. Grant Richards in 19O2.
48,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Acknowledgment and thanks for permission to reprint the various poems
49,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,included in this volume are herewith made to the different publishers.
50,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
51,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"The two poems, ""in Arcady"" and ""The Black Knight"" are new and are"
52,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,published here for the first time.
53,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
54,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,In making the selections for the present book Mr. Cawein has endeavored to
55,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"cover the entire field of his poetical labors, which extends over a"
56,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"quarter of a century. With the exception of his dramatic work, as"
57,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"witnessed by one volume only, ""The Shadow Garden,"" a book of plays four in"
58,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"number, published in 1910, the selection herewith presented by us is, in"
59,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"our opinion, representative of the author's poetical work."

214,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN
215,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
216,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"When a poet begins writing, and we begin liking his work, we own willingly"
217,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"enough that we have not, and cannot have, got the compass of his talent."
218,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"We must wait till he has written more, and we have learned to like him"
219,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"more, and even then we should hesitate his definition, from all that he"
220,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"has done, if we did not very commonly qualify ourselves from the latest"
221,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,thing he has done. Between the earliest thing and the latest thing there
222,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"may have been a hundred different things, and in his swan-long life of a"
223,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"singer there would probably be a hundred yet, and all different. But we"
224,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,take the latest as if it summed him up in motive and range and tendency.
225,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Many parts of his work offer themselves in confirmation of our judgment,"
226,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"while those which might impeach it shrink away and hide themselves, and"
227,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"leave us to our precipitation, our catastrophe."
228,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
229,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,It was surely nothing less than by a catastrophe that I should have been
230,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,so betrayed in the volumes of Mr. Cawein's verse which reached me last
231,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,before the volume of his collected poems.... I had read his poetry and
232,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"loved it from the beginning, and in each successive expression of it, I"
233,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,had delighted in its expanding and maturing beauty. I believe I had not
234,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"failed to own its compass, and when--"
235,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
236,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"""He touched the tender stops of various quills,"""
237,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
238,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,I had responded to every note of the changing music. I did not always
239,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"respond audibly either in public or in private, for it seemed to me that"
240,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,so old a friend might fairly rest on the laurels he had helped bestow. But
241,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"when that last volume came, I said to myself, ""This applausive silence has"
242,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,gone on long enough. It is time to break it with open appreciation.
243,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Still,"" I said, ""I must guard against too great appreciation; I must mix"
244,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"in a little depreciation, to show that I have read attentively,"
245,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"critically, authoritatively."" So I applied myself to the cheapest and"
246,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"easiest means of depreciation, and asked, ""Why do you always write Nature"
247,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"poems? Why not Human Nature poems?"" or the like. But in seizing upon an"
248,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"objection so obvious that I ought to have known it was superficial, I had"
249,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"wronged a poet, who had never done me harm, but only good, in the very"
250,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,terms and conditions of his being a poet. I had not stayed to see that his
251,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"nature poetry was instinct with human poetry, with _his_ human poetry,"
252,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"with mine, with yours. I had made his reproach what ought to have been his"
253,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"finest praise, what is always the praise of poetry when it is not"
254,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"artificial and formal. I ought to have said, as I had seen, that not one"
255,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of his lovely landscapes in which I could discover no human figure, but"
256,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,thrilled with a human presence penetrating to it from his most sensitive
257,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"and subtle spirit until it was all but painfully alive with memories, with"
258,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"regrets, with longings, with hopes, with all that from time to time"
259,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"mutably constitutes us men and women, and yet keeps us children. He has"
260,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"the gift, in a measure that I do not think surpassed in any poet, of"
261,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"touching some smallest or commonest thing in nature, and making it live"
262,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"from the manifold associations in which we have our being, and glow"
263,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,thereafter with an inextinguishable beauty. His felicities do not seem
264,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"sought; rather they seem to seek him, and to surprise him with the delight"
265,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"they impart through him. He has the inspiration of the right word, and the"
266,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"courage of it, so that though in the first instant you may be challenged,"
267,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"you may be revolted, by something that you might have thought uncouth, you"
268,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"are presently overcome by the happy bravery of it, and gladly recognize"
269,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"that no other word of those verbal saints or aristocrats, dedicated to the"
270,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"worship or service of beauty, would at all so well have conveyed the sense"
271,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,of it as this or that plebeian.
272,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
273,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"If I began indulging myself in the pleasure of quotation, or the delight"
274,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of giving proofs of what I say, I should soon and far transcend the modest"
275,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,bounds which the editor has set my paper. But the reader may take it from
276,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"me that no other poet, not even of the great Elizabethan range, can"
277,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,outword this poet when it comes to choosing some epithet fresh from the
278,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"earth or air, and with the morning sun or light upon it, for an emotion or"
279,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,experience in which the race renews its youth from generation to
280,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,generation. He is of the kind of Keats and Shelley and Wordsworth and
281,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Coleridge, in that truth to observance and experience of nature and the"
282,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"joyous expression of it, which are the dominant characteristics of his"
283,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,art. It is imaginable that the thinness of the social life in the Middle
284,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"West threw the poet upon the communion with the fields and woods, the days"
285,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"and nights, the changing seasons, in which another great nature poet of"
286,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"ours declares they ""speak in various language."" But nothing could be"
287,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"farther from the didactic mood in which ""communion with the various forms"""
288,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of nature casts the Puritanic soul of Bryant, than the mood in which this"
289,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"German-blooded, Kentucky-born poet, who keeps throughout his song the"
290,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"sense of a perpetual and inalienable youth, with a spirit as pagan as that"
291,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,which breathes from Greek sculpture--but happily not more pagan. Most
292,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"modern poets who are antique are rather over-Hellenic, in their wish not"
293,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"to be English or French, but there is nothing voluntary in Mr. Cawein's"
294,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,naturalization in the older world of myth and fable; he is too sincerely
295,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,and solely a poet to be a _posseur;_ he has his eyes everywhere except on
296,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"the spectator, and his affair is to report the beauty that he sees, as if"
297,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,there were no one by to hear.
298,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
299,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,An interesting and charming trait of his poetry is its constant theme of
300,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,youth and its limit within the range that the emotions and aspirations of
301,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,youth take. He might indeed be called the poet of youth if he resented
302,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"being called the poet of nature; but the poet of youth, be it understood,"
303,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of vague regrets, of ""tears, idle tears,"" of ""long, long thoughts,"" for"
304,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"that is the real youth, and not the youth of the supposed hilarity, the"
305,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"attributive recklessness, the daring hopes. Perhaps there is some such"
306,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"youth as this, but it has not its home in the breast of any young poet,"
307,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"and he rarely utters it; at best he is of a light melancholy, a smiling"
308,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"wistfulness, and upon the whole, October is more to his mind than May."
309,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
310,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"In Mr. Cawein's work, therefore, what is not the expression of the world"
311,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"we vainly and rashly call the inanimate world, is the hardly more"
312,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"dramatized, and not more enchantingly imagined story of lovers, rather"
313,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,unhappy lovers. He finds his own in this sort far and near; in classic
314,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Greece, in heroic England, in romantic Germany, where the blue flower"
315,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"blows, but not less in beautiful and familiar Kentucky, where the blue"
316,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"grass shows itself equally the emblem of poetry, and the moldering log in"
317,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,the cabin wall or the woodland path is of the same poetic value as the
318,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,marble of the ruined temple or the stone of the crumbling castle. His
319,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,singularly creative fancy breathes a soul into every scene; his touch
320,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,leaves everything that was dull to the sense before glowing in the light
321,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of joyful recognition. He classifies his poems by different names, and"
322,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"they are of different themes, but they are after all of that unity which I"
323,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"have been trying, all too shirkingly, to suggest. One, for instance, is"
324,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"the pathetic story which tells itself in the lyrical eclogue ""One Day and"
325,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Another."" It is the conversation, prolonged from meeting to meeting,"
326,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,between two lovers whom death parts; but who recurrently find themselves
327,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"and each other in the gardens and the woods, and on the waters which they"
328,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,tell each other of and together delight in. The effect is that which is
329,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"truest to youth and love, for these transmutations of emotion form the"
330,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,disguise of self which makes passion tolerable; but mechanically the
331,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,result is a series of nature poems. More genuinely dramatic are such
332,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"pieces as ""The Feud,"" ""Ku Klux,"" and ""The Lynchers,"" three out of many;"
333,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"but one which I value more because it is worthy of Wordsworth, or of"
334,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"Tennyson in a Wordsworthian mood, is ""The Old Mill,"" where, with all the"
335,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"wonted charm of his landscape art, Mr. Cawein gives us a strongly local"
336,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,and novel piece of character painting.
337,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
338,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,I deny myself with increasing reluctance the pleasure of quoting the
339,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"stanzas, the verses, the phrases, the epithets, which lure me by scores"
340,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,and hundreds in his poems. It must suffice me to say that I do not know
341,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,any poem of his which has not some such a felicity; I do not know any poem
342,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of his which is not worth reading, at least the first time, and often the"
343,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"second and the third time, and so on as often as you have the chance of"
344,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,recurring to it. Some disappoint and others delight more than others; but
345,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,there is none but in greater or less measure has the witchery native to
346,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"the poet, and his place and his period."
347,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,
348,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,It is only in order of his later time that I would put Mr. Cawein first
349,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"among those Midwestern poets, of whom he is the youngest. Poetry in the"
350,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,Middle West has had its development in which it was eclipsed by the
351,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"splendor, transitory if not vain, of the California school. But it is"
352,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"deeply rooted in the life of the region, and is as true to its origins as"
353,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,any faithful portraiture of the Midwestern landscape could be; you could
354,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,not mistake the source of the poem or the picture. In a certain tenderness
355,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"of light and coloring, the poems would recall the mellowed masterpieces of"
356,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,"the older literatures rather than those of the New England school, where"
357,THE POETRY OF MADISON CAWEIN,conscience dwells almost rebukingly with beauty....

2342,QUIET LANES,"The beech-nuts' burrs their little purses thrust,"
2343,QUIET LANES,Plump with the copper of the nuts that rust;
2344,QUIET LANES,Above the grass the spendthrift spider weaves

2348,QUIET LANES,"The polished acorns, from their saucers broke,"

2400,QUIET LANES,"Hangs up a goblin bonnet, pixy-brought"

2789,--HENRY IV,
2790,--HENRY IV,And we have met but twice or thrice!--

3035,I,"Past quince-trees where the bluebirds sing,"
3036,I,"And peonies are blossoming,"
3037,I,"Unto a porch, wistaria-hung,"
3038,I,"Around whose steps May-lilies blow,"
3039,I,"A fair girl reaches down among,"
3040,I,Her arm more white than their sweet snow.

3042,II,II
3043,II,
3044,II,What words of mine can tell the spell
3045,II,Of garden ways I know so well?--
3046,II,"Another path that leads me, when"
3047,II,"The summer time is here again,"
3048,II,Past hollyhocks that shame the west
3049,II,When the red sun has sunk to rest;
3050,II,"To roses bowering a nest,"
3051,II,"A lattice, 'neath which mignonette"
3052,II,"And deep geraniums surge and sough,"
3053,II,"Where, in the twilight, starless yet,"
3054,II,A fair girl's eyes are stars enough.

3061,III,"Of autumn wrap the hills in haze,"
3062,III,"Beneath the pippin-pelting tree,"
3063,III,'Mid flitting butterfly and bee;
3064,III,"Unto a door where, fiery,"
3065,III,"The creeper climbs; and, garnet-hued,"
3066,III,"The cock's-comb and the dahlia flare,"
3067,III,"And in the door, where shades intrude,"
3068,III,Gleams bright a fair girl's sunbeam hair.

3071,IV,
3072,IV,What words of mine can tell the spell

3075,IV,"Of winter, when the moon is tossed"
3076,IV,"In clouds; beneath great cedars, weak"
3077,IV,With shaggy snow; past shrubs blown bleak
3078,IV,With shivering leaves; to eaves that leak
3079,IV,"The tattered ice, whereunder is"
3080,IV,A fire-flickering window-space;
3081,IV,"And in the light, with lips to kiss,"
3082,IV,A fair girl's welcome-smiling face.

3089,I,
3090,I,"First I asked the honeybee,"
3091,I,Busy in the balmy bowers;
3092,I,"Saying, ""Sweetheart, tell it me:"
3093,I,"Have you seen her, honeybee?"
3094,I,She is cousin to the flowers--
3095,I,All the sweetness of the south
3096,I,"In her wild-rose face and mouth."""
3097,I,But the bee passed silently.
3098,I,
3099,II,II
3100,II,
3101,II,"Then I asked the forest bird,"
3102,II,Warbling by the woodland waters;
3103,II,"Saying, ""Dearest, have you heard?"
3104,II,"Have you heard her, forest bird?"
3105,II,She is one of music's daughters--
3106,II,Never song so sweet by half
3107,II,"As the music of her laugh."""
3108,II,But the bird said not a word.
3109,II,
3110,III,III
3111,III,
3112,III,"Next I asked the evening sky,"
3113,III,Hanging out its lamps of fire;
3114,III,"Saying, ""Loved one, passed she by?"
3115,III,"Tell me, tell me, evening sky!"
3116,III,"She, the star of my desire--"
3117,III,"Sister whom the Pleiads lost,"
3118,III,"And my soul's high pentecost."""
3119,III,But the sky made no reply.
3120,III,
3121,IV,IV
3122,IV,
3123,IV,"Where is she? ah, where is she?"
3124,IV,She to whom both love and duty
3125,IV,"Bind me, yea, immortally.--"
3126,IV,"Where is she? ah, where is she?"
3127,IV,Symbol of the Earth-Soul's beauty.
3128,IV,I have lost her. Help my heart

3490,THE PICTURE,"The purple west as if, with God imbued,"
3491,THE PICTURE,Her mighty palette Nature there laid down.
3492,THE PICTURE,
3493,THE PICTURE,"Amid such flowers, underneath such skies,"
3494,THE PICTURE,"Embodying all life knows of sweet and fair,"
3495,THE PICTURE,"She stood; love's dreams in girlhood's face and eyes,"
3496,THE PICTURE,Fair as a star that comes to emphasize
3497,THE PICTURE,The mingled beauty of the earth and air.
3498,THE PICTURE,
3499,THE PICTURE,"Behind her, seen through vines and orchard trees,"
3500,THE PICTURE,Gray with its twinkling windows--like the face
3501,THE PICTURE,Of calm old age that sits and dreams at ease--
3502,THE PICTURE,"Porched with old roses, haunts of honeybees,"
3503,THE PICTURE,The homestead loomed within a lilied space.
3504,THE PICTURE,
3505,THE PICTURE,"For whom she waited in the afterglow,"
3506,THE PICTURE,"Star-eyed and golden 'mid the poppy and rose,"
3507,THE PICTURE,"I do not know; I do not care to know,--"
3508,THE PICTURE,"It is enough I keep her picture so,"
3509,THE PICTURE,"Hung up, like poetry, in my life's dull prose."
3510,THE PICTURE,
3511,THE PICTURE,"A fragrant picture, where I still may find"
3512,THE PICTURE,"Her face untouched of sorrow or regret,"
3513,THE PICTURE,Unspoiled of contact; ever young and kind;
3514,THE PICTURE,"The spiritual sweetheart of my soul and mind,"
3515,THE PICTURE,"She had not been, perhaps, if we had met."

3521,MOLY,When by the wall the tiger-flower swings
3522,MOLY,A head of sultry slumber and aroma;
3523,MOLY,"And by the path, whereon the blown rose flings"
3524,MOLY,"Its obsolete beauty, the long lilies foam a"
3525,MOLY,"White place of perfume, like a beautiful breast--"
3526,MOLY,"Between the pansy fire of the west,"
3527,MOLY,"And poppy mist of moonrise in the east,"
3528,MOLY,This heartache will have ceased.
3529,MOLY,
3530,MOLY,The witchcraft of soft music and sweet sleep--
3531,MOLY,"Let it beguile the burthen from my spirit,"
3532,MOLY,And white dreams reap me as strong reapers reap
3533,MOLY,The ripened grain and full blown blossom near it;
3534,MOLY,Let me behold how gladness gives the whole
3535,MOLY,The transformed countenance of my own soul--
3536,MOLY,Between the sunset and the risen moon
3537,MOLY,Let sorrow vanish soon.
3538,MOLY,
3539,MOLY,And these things then shall keep me company:
3540,MOLY,The elfins of the dew; the spirit of laughter
3541,MOLY,Who haunts the wind; the god of melody
3542,MOLY,"Who sings within the stream, that reaches after"
3543,MOLY,
3544,MOLY,The flow'rs that rock themselves to his caress:
3545,MOLY,"These of themselves shall shape my happiness,"
3546,MOLY,"Whose visible presence I shall lean upon,"
3547,MOLY,Feeling that care is gone.
3548,MOLY,
3549,MOLY,Forgetting how the cankered flower must die;
3550,MOLY,"The worm-pierced fruit fall, sicklied to its syrup;"
3551,MOLY,"How joy, begotten 'twixt a sigh and sigh,"
3552,MOLY,"Waits with one foot forever in the stirrup,--"
3553,MOLY,Remembering how within the hollow lute
3554,MOLY,Soft music sleeps when music's voice is mute;
3555,MOLY,"And in the heart, when all seems black despair,"
3556,MOLY,"Hope sits, awaiting there."

3563,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Here there is sadness in the early year:
3564,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Here sorrow waits where joy went laughing late:
3565,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,The sicklied face of heaven hangs like hate
3566,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Above the woodland and the meadowland;
3567,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And Spring hath taken fire in her hand
3568,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Of frost and made a dead bloom of her face,"
3569,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Which was a flower of marvel once and grace,"
3570,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And sweet serenity and stainless glow.
3571,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Delay not. Let us go.
3572,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3573,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Let us go far away
3574,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Into the sunrise of a fairer May:
3575,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Where all the nights resign them to the moon,"
3576,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"And drug their souls with odor and soft tune,"
3577,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And tell their dreams in starlight: where the hours
3578,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Teach immortality with fadeless flowers;
3579,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"And all the day the bee weights down the bloom,"
3580,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"And all the night the moth shakes strange perfume,"
3581,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Like music, from the flower-bells' affluence."
3582,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Let us go far from hence.
3583,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3584,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Why should we sit and weep,"
3585,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And yearn with heavy eyelids still to sleep?
3586,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Forever hiding from our hearts the hate,--"
3587,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Death within death,--life doth accumulate,"
3588,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Like winter snows along the barren leas
3589,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"And sterile hills, whereon no lover sees"
3590,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,The crocus limn the beautiful in flame;
3591,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Or hyacinth and jonquil write the name
3592,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Of Love in fire, for each passer-by."
3593,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Why should we sit and sigh?
3594,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3595,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"We will not stay and long,"
3596,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Here where our souls are wasting for a song;
3597,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Where no bird sings; and, dim beneath the stars,"
3598,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,No silvery water strikes melodious bars;
3599,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And in the rocks and forest-covered hills
3600,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,No quick-tongued echo from her grotto fills
3601,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,With eery syllables the solitude--
3602,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,The vocal image of the voice that wooed--
3603,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"She, of wild sounds the airy looking-glass."
3604,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Our souls are tired, alas!"
3605,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3606,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,What should we say to her?--
3607,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"To Spring, who in our hearts makes no sweet stir:"
3608,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Who looks not on us nor gives thought unto:
3609,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Too busy with the birth of flowers and dew,"
3610,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And vague gold wings within the chrysalis;
3611,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Or Love, who will not miss us; had no kiss"
3612,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"To give your soul or the sad soul of me,"
3613,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Who bound our hearts to her in poesy,"
3614,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Long since, and wear her badge of service still.--"
3615,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Have we not served our fill?
3616,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3617,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,We will go far away.
3618,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Song will not care, who slays our souls each day"
3619,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"With the dark daggers of denying eyes,"
3620,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"And lips of silence! ... Had she sighed us lies,"
3621,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Not passionate, yet falsely tremulous,"
3622,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,And lent her mouth to ours in mockery; thus
3623,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Smiled from calm eyes as if appreciative;
3624,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Then, then our love had taught itself to live"
3625,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Feeding itself on hope, and recompense."
3626,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,But no!--So let us hence.
3627,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,
3628,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,So be the Bible shut
3629,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Of all her Beauty, and her wisdom but"
3630,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,A clasp for memory! We will not seek
3631,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,The light that came not when the soul was weak
3632,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"With longing, and the darkness gave no sign"
3633,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Of star-born comfort. Nay! why kneel and whine
3634,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Sad psalms of patience and hosannas of
3635,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,Old hope and dreary canticles of love?--
3636,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,"Let us depart, since, as we long supposed,"
3637,POPPY AND MANDRAGORA,For us God's book was closed.

3665,PHANTOMS,"This was her home, whose beauty now is dust,"
3666,PHANTOMS,A lonely memory for melodies
3667,PHANTOMS,"The wild birds sing, the wild birds and the bees."
3668,PHANTOMS,
3669,PHANTOMS,Here every evening is a prayer: no boast

3671,PHANTOMS,"Here, through the twilight, like a pale flower's ghost,"
3672,PHANTOMS,"A drowsy flutter, flies the tiger-moth;"

3783,IV,A captive in the prismed dew.
3784,IV,

3789,IV,And in the night it sings and sighs
3790,IV,The songs the winds and waters love;

3845,VI,
3846,VI,From silver-blue to amethyst
3847,VI,The shadows deepened in the vale;

3850,VI,Built up its exhalation far;
3851,VI,"A jewel on an Afrit's wrist,"
3852,VI,One star gemmed sunset's cinnabar.

3868,VII,As if--'neath skies gone mad with fear--

3883,VII,With limbs and leaves; the wood-pool filled
3884,VII,With overgurgling.--Bleak and cold

3929,IX,The bitter myrrh of dead leaves fills
3930,IX,Wet valleys (where the gaunt weeds bleach)
3931,IX,With rainy scents of wood-decay;--
3932,IX,As if a spirit all the day
3933,IX,Sat breathing softly 'neath the beech.
3934,IX,
3935,IX,"With other eyes I see her flit,"
3936,IX,"The wood-witch of the wild perfumes,"
3937,IX,"Among her elfin owls,--that sit,"
3938,IX,"A drowsy white, in crescent-lit"
3939,IX,Dim glens of opalescent glooms:--
3940,IX,"Where, for her magic, buds and blooms"
3941,IX,"Mysterious perfumes, while she stands,"
3942,IX,"A thornlike shadow, summoning"
3943,IX,"The sleepy odors, that take wing"
3944,IX,Like bubbles from her dewy hands.
3945,IX,
3946,X,X
3947,X,
3948,X,Among the woods they call to me--
3949,X,The lights that haunt the wood and stream;
3950,X,Voices of such white ecstasy
3951,X,As moves with hushed lips through a dream:
3952,X,"They stand in auraed radiances,"
3953,X,Or flash with nimbused limbs across
3954,X,"Their golden shadows on the moss,"
3955,X,Or slip in silver through the trees.
3956,X,
3957,X,What love can give the heart in me
3958,X,More hope and exaltation than
3959,X,The hand of light that tips the tree
3960,X,And beckons far from marts of man?
3961,X,That reaches foamy fingers through
3962,X,"The broken ripple, and replies"
3963,X,With sparkling speech of lips and eyes
3964,X,To souls who seek and still pursue.
3965,X,
3966,XI,XI
3967,XI,
3968,XI,"Give me the streams, that counterfeit"
3969,XI,The twilight of autumnal skies;
3970,XI,"The shadowy, silent waters, lit"
3971,XI,With fire like a woman's eyes!
3972,XI,"Slow waters that, in autumn, glass"
3973,XI,"The scarlet-strewn and golden grass,"
3974,XI,And drink the sunset's tawny dyes.
3975,XI,
3976,XI,"Give me the pools, that lie among"
3977,XI,"The centuried forests! give me those,"
3978,XI,"Deep, dim, and sad as darkness hung"
3979,XI,Beneath the sunset's somber rose:
3980,XI,"Still pools, in whose vague mirrors look--"
3981,XI,Like ragged gypsies round a book
3982,XI,Of magic--trees in wild repose.
3983,XI,
3984,XI,"No quiet thing, or innocent,"
3985,XI,"Of water, earth, or air shall please"
3986,XI,My soul now: but the violent
3987,XI,Between the sunset and the trees:
3988,XI,"The fierce, the splendid, and intense,"
3989,XI,"That love matures in innocence,"
3990,XI,"Like mighty music, give me these!"
3991,XI,
3992,XII,XII
3993,XII,
3994,XII,When thorn-tree copses still were bare
3995,XII,And black along the turbid brook;
3996,XII,When catkined willows blurred and shook
3997,XII,Great tawny tangles in the air;
3998,XII,"In bottomlands, the first thaw makes"
3999,XII,"An oozy bog, beneath the trees,"
4000,XII,"Prophetic of the spring that wakes,"
4001,XII,Sang the sonorous hylodes.
4002,XII,
4003,XII,"Now that wild winds have stripped the thorn,"
4004,XII,And clogged with leaves the forest-creek;
4005,XII,"Now that the woods look blown and bleak,"
4006,XII,And webs are frosty white at morn;
4007,XII,"At night beneath the spectral sky,"
4008,XII,A far foreboding cry I hear--
4009,XII,The wild fowl calling as they fly?
4010,XII,Or wild voice of the dying Year?
4011,XII,
4012,XIII,XIII
4013,XIII,
4014,XIII,"And still my soul holds phantom tryst,"
4015,XIII,"When chestnuts hiss among the coals,"
4016,XIII,"Upon the Evening of All Souls,"
4017,XIII,"When all the night is moon and mist,"
4018,XIII,And all the world is mystery;
4019,XIII,"I kiss dear lips that death hath kissed,"
4020,XIII,"And gaze in eyes no man may see,"
4021,XIII,Filled with a love long lost to me.
4022,XIII,
4023,XIII,I hear the night-wind's ghostly glove
4024,XIII,Flutter the window: then the knob
4025,XIII,"Of some dark door turn, with a sob"
4026,XIII,As when love comes to gaze on love
4027,XIII,Who lies pale-coffined in a room:
4028,XIII,And then the iron gallop of
4029,XIII,"The storm, who rides outside; his plume"
4030,XIII,Sweeping the night with dread and gloom.
4031,XIII,
4032,XIII,"So fancy takes the mind, and paints"
4033,XIII,"The darkness with eidolon light,"
4034,XIII,And writes the dead's romance in night
4035,XIII,On the dim Evening of All Saints:
4036,XIII,Unheard the hissing nuts; the clink
4037,XIII,"And fall of coals, whose shadow faints"
4038,XIII,"Around the hearts that sit and think,"
4039,XIII,Borne far beyond the actual's brink.
4040,XIII,
4041,XIV,XIV
4042,XIV,
4043,XIV,"I heard the wind, before the morn"
4044,XIV,"Stretched gaunt, gray fingers 'thwart my pane,"
4045,XIV,"Drive clouds down, a dark dragon-train;"
4046,XIV,"Its iron visor closed, a horn"
4047,XIV,Of steel from out the north it wound.--
4048,XIV,"No morn like yesterday's! whose mouth,"
4049,XIV,"A cool carnation, from the south"
4050,XIV,Breathed through a golden reed the sound
4051,XIV,Of days that drop clear gold upon
4052,XIV,Cerulean silver floors of dawn.
4053,XIV,
4054,XIV,And all of yesterday is lost
4055,XIV,And swallowed in to-day's wild light--
4056,XIV,"The birth deformed of day and night,"
4057,XIV,"The illegitimate, who cost"
4058,XIV,Its mother secret tears and sighs;
4059,XIV,Unlovely since unloved; and chilled
4060,XIV,With sorrows and the shame that filled
4061,XIV,Its parents' love; which was not wise
4062,XIV,In passion as the day and night
4063,XIV,That married yestermorn with light.
4064,XIV,
4065,XV,XV
4066,XV,
4067,XV,"Down through the dark, indignant trees,"
4068,XV,On indistinguishable wings
4069,XV,"Of storm, the wind of evening swings;"
4070,XV,Before its insane anger flees
4071,XV,Distracted leaf and shattered bough:
4072,XV,There is a rushing as when seas
4073,XV,Of thunder beat an iron prow
4074,XV,On reefs of wrath and roaring wreck:
4075,XV,"'Mid stormy leaves, a hurrying speck"
4076,XV,"Of flickering blackness, driven by,"
4077,XV,A mad bat whirls along the sky.
4078,XV,
4079,XV,"Like some sad shadow, in the eve's"
4080,XV,Deep melancholy--visible
4081,XV,As by some strange and twilight spell--
4082,XV,"A gaunt girl stands among the leaves,"
4083,XV,The night-wind in her dolorous dress:
4084,XV,"Symbolic of the life that grieves,"
4085,XV,"Of toil that patience makes not less,"
4086,XV,Her load of fagots fallen there.--
4087,XV,"A wilder shadow sweeps the air,"
4088,XV,And she is gone.... Was it the dumb
4089,XV,Eidolon of the month to come?
4090,XV,
4091,XVI,XVI
4092,XVI,
4093,XVI,The song birds--are they flown away?
4094,XVI,"The song birds of the summer time,"
4095,XVI,"That sang their souls into the day,"
4096,XVI,And set the laughing hours to rhyme.
4097,XVI,No catbird scatters through the bush
4098,XVI,The sparkling crystals of its song;
4099,XVI,Within the woods no hermit-thrush
4100,XVI,Thridding with vocal gold the hush.
4101,XVI,
4102,XVI,All day the crows fly cawing past:
4103,XVI,The acorns drop: the forests scowl:
4104,XVI,At night I hear the bitter blast
4105,XVI,Hoot with the hooting of the owl.
4106,XVI,The wild creeks freeze: the ways are strewn
4107,XVI,With leaves that clog: beneath the tree
4108,XVI,"The bird, that set its toil to tune,"
4109,XVI,"And made a home for melody,"
4110,XVI,Lies dead beneath the snow-white moon.

4116,OCTOBER,"Far off a wind blew, and I heard"
4117,OCTOBER,Wild echoes of the woods reply--
4118,OCTOBER,"The herald of some royal word,"
4119,OCTOBER,"With bannered trumpet, blown on high,"
4120,OCTOBER,Meseemed then passed me by:
4121,OCTOBER,
4122,OCTOBER,"Who summoned marvels there to meet,"
4123,OCTOBER,"With pomp, upon a cloth of gold;"
4124,OCTOBER,"Where berries of the bittersweet,"
4125,OCTOBER,"That, splitting, showed the coals they hold,"
4126,OCTOBER,Sowed garnets through the wold:
4127,OCTOBER,
4128,OCTOBER,"Where, under tents of maples, seeds"
4129,OCTOBER,"Of smooth carnelian, oval red,"
4130,OCTOBER,"The spice-bush spangled: where, like beads,"
4131,OCTOBER,The dogwood's rounded rubies--fed
4132,OCTOBER,With fire--blazed and bled.
4133,OCTOBER,
4134,OCTOBER,And there I saw amid the rout
4135,OCTOBER,"Of months, in richness cavalier,"
4136,OCTOBER,A minnesinger--lips apout;
4137,OCTOBER,A gypsy face; straight as a spear;
4138,OCTOBER,A rose stuck in his ear:
4139,OCTOBER,
4140,OCTOBER,"Eyes, sparkling like old German wine,"
4141,OCTOBER,All mirth and moonlight; naught to spare
4142,OCTOBER,"Of slender beard, that lent a line"
4143,OCTOBER,"To his short lip; October there,"
4144,OCTOBER,With chestnut curling hair.
4145,OCTOBER,
4146,OCTOBER,His brown baretta swept its plume
4147,OCTOBER,"Red through the leaves; his purple hose,"
4148,OCTOBER,"Puffed at the thighs, made gleam of gloom;"
4149,OCTOBER,"His tawny doublet, slashed with rose,"
4150,OCTOBER,"And laced with crimson bows,"
4151,OCTOBER,
4152,OCTOBER,"Outshone the wahoo's scarlet pride,"
4153,OCTOBER,"The haw, in rich vermilion dressed:"
4154,OCTOBER,"A dagger dangling at his side,"
4155,OCTOBER,"A slim lute, banded to his breast,"
4156,OCTOBER,Whereon his hands were pressed.
4157,OCTOBER,
4158,OCTOBER,"I saw him come.... And, lo, to hear"
4159,OCTOBER,"The lilt of his approaching lute,"
4160,OCTOBER,No wonder that the regnant Year
4161,OCTOBER,"Bent down her beauty, blushing mute,"
4162,OCTOBER,Her heart beneath his foot.

4174,FRIENDS,
4175,FRIENDS,"I found the fields where, row on row,"
4176,FRIENDS,The blackberries hang dark with fruit;

4185,FRIENDS,To lure us in; while all around
4186,FRIENDS,"Our heads,--like faery fancies,--shot"
4187,FRIENDS,The dragonflies without a sound.
4188,FRIENDS,
4189,FRIENDS,"The pond, above which evening bent"
4190,FRIENDS,To gaze upon her gypsy face;
4191,FRIENDS,Wherein the twinkling night would trace
4192,FRIENDS,"A vague, inverted firmament;"
4193,FRIENDS,"In which the green frogs tuned their bass,"
4194,FRIENDS,And firefly sparkles came and went.
4195,FRIENDS,

4407,III,Picking its rusty and monotonous lute;

4428,THE WILD IRIS,In emerald darkness round us. Many a stone
4429,THE WILD IRIS,"And gnarly root, gray-mossed, made wild our way:"
4430,THE WILD IRIS,And many a bird the glimmering light along
4431,THE WILD IRIS,Showered the golden bubbles of its song.
4432,THE WILD IRIS,
4433,THE WILD IRIS,"Then in the valley, where the brook went by,"

4438,THE WILD IRIS,The gaze of Spring had there materialized.
4439,THE WILD IRIS,
4440,THE WILD IRIS,I have forgotten many things since then--
4441,THE WILD IRIS,Much beauty and much happiness and grief;

4443,THE WILD IRIS,Rejoicing in the knowledge life is brief.

4453,THE WILD IRIS,
4454,THE WILD IRIS,Nor I how May then minted treasuries
4455,THE WILD IRIS,Of crowfoot gold; and molded out of light
4456,THE WILD IRIS,"The sorrel's cups, whose elfin chalices"
4457,THE WILD IRIS,Of limpid spar were streaked with rosy white:
4458,THE WILD IRIS,"Nor all the stars of twinkling spiderwort,"
4459,THE WILD IRIS,And mandrake moons with which her brows were girt.

4461,THE WILD IRIS,"But most of all, yea, it were well for me,"

4845,THE LOCUST,
4846,THE LOCUST,"Thou pulse of hotness, who, with reedlike breast,"
4847,THE LOCUST,"Makest meridian music, long and loud,"
4848,THE LOCUST,Accentuating summer!--Dost thy best
4849,THE LOCUST,"To make the sunbeams fiercer, and to crowd"
4850,THE LOCUST,"With lonesomeness the long, close afternoon--"
4851,THE LOCUST,"When Labor leans, swart-faced and beady-browed,"
4852,THE LOCUST,Upon his sultry scythe--thou tangible tune
4853,THE LOCUST,"Of heat, whose waves incessantly arise"
4854,THE LOCUST,Quivering and clear beneath the cloudless skies.
4855,THE LOCUST,
4856,THE LOCUST,"Thou singest, and upon his haggard hills"
4857,THE LOCUST,Drouth yawns and rubs his heavy eyes and wakes;
4858,THE LOCUST,Brushes the hot hair from his face; and fills
4859,THE LOCUST,The land with death as sullenly he takes
4860,THE LOCUST,Downward his dusty way. 'Midst woods and fields
4861,THE LOCUST,At every pool his burning thirst he slakes:
4862,THE LOCUST,"No grove so deep, no bank so high it shields"
4863,THE LOCUST,A spring from him; no creek evades his eye:
4864,THE LOCUST,He needs but look and they are withered dry.
4865,THE LOCUST,
4866,THE LOCUST,"Thou singest, and thy song is as a spell"
4867,THE LOCUST,Of somnolence to charm the land with sleep;
4868,THE LOCUST,"A thorn of sound that pierces dale and dell,"
4869,THE LOCUST,Diffusing slumber over vale and steep.
4870,THE LOCUST,"Sleepy the forest, nodding sleepy boughs;"
4871,THE LOCUST,Sleepy the pastures with their sleepy sheep:
4872,THE LOCUST,Sleepy the creek where sleepily the cows
4873,THE LOCUST,Stand knee-deep; and the very heaven seems
4874,THE LOCUST,Sleepy and lost in undetermined dreams.
4875,THE LOCUST,
4876,THE LOCUST,"Art thou a rattle that Monotony,"
4877,THE LOCUST,"Summer's dull nurse, old sister of slow Time,"
4878,THE LOCUST,"Shakes for Day's peevish pleasure, who in glee"
4879,THE LOCUST,Takes its discordant music for sweet rhyme?
4880,THE LOCUST,"Or oboe that the Summer Noontide plays,"
4881,THE LOCUST,"Sitting with Ripeness 'neath the orchard tree,"
4882,THE LOCUST,"Trying repeatedly the same shrill phrase,"
4883,THE LOCUST,Until the musky peach with weariness
4884,THE LOCUST,"Drops, and the hum of murmuring bees grows less?"

4891,THE DEAD DAY,"Of cloudy granite and of gold,"
4892,THE DEAD DAY,Where twilight's priestly hours inter
4893,THE DEAD DAY,The Day like some great king of old.
4894,THE DEAD DAY,
4895,THE DEAD DAY,"A censer, rimmed with silver fire,"
4896,THE DEAD DAY,The new moon swings above his tomb;
4897,THE DEAD DAY,"While, organ-stops of God's own choir,"
4898,THE DEAD DAY,Star after star throbs in the gloom.
4899,THE DEAD DAY,
4900,THE DEAD DAY,"And Night draws near, the sadly sweet--"
4901,THE DEAD DAY,A nun whose face is calm and fair--
4902,THE DEAD DAY,And kneeling at the dead Day's feet
4903,THE DEAD DAY,Her soul goes up in mists like prayer.
4904,THE DEAD DAY,
4905,THE DEAD DAY,"In prayer, we feel through dewy gleam"
4906,THE DEAD DAY,"And flowery fragrance, and--above"

4913,THE OLD WATER MILL,
4914,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Wild ridge on ridge the wooded hills arise,"
4915,THE OLD WATER MILL,Between whose breezy vistas gulfs of skies
4916,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Pilot great clouds like towering argosies,"
4917,THE OLD WATER MILL,And hawk and buzzard breast the azure breeze.
4918,THE OLD WATER MILL,With many a foaming fall and glimmering reach
4919,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of placid murmur, under elm and beech,"
4920,THE OLD WATER MILL,The creek goes twinkling through long gleams and glooms
4921,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of woodland quiet, summered with perfumes:"
4922,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The creek, in whose clear shallows minnow-schools"
4923,THE OLD WATER MILL,Glitter or dart; and by whose deeper pools
4924,THE OLD WATER MILL,The blue kingfishers and the herons haunt;
4925,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That, often startled from the freckled flaunt"
4926,THE OLD WATER MILL,Of blackberry-lilies--where they feed or hide--
4927,THE OLD WATER MILL,Trail a lank flight along the forestside
4928,THE OLD WATER MILL,With eery clangor. Here a sycamore
4929,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Smooth, wave-uprooted, builds from shore to shore"
4930,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A headlong bridge; and there, a storm-hurled oak"
4931,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Lays a long dam, where sand and gravel choke"
4932,THE OLD WATER MILL,The water's lazy way. Here mistflower blurs
4933,THE OLD WATER MILL,Its bit of heaven; there the ox-eye stirs
4934,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Its gloaming hues of pearl and gold; and here,"
4935,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A gray, cool stain, like dawn's own atmosphere,"
4936,THE OLD WATER MILL,The dim wild carrot lifts its crumpled crest:
4937,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And over all, at slender flight or rest,"
4938,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The dragonflies, like coruscating rays"
4939,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of lapis-lazuli and chrysoprase,"
4940,THE OLD WATER MILL,Drowsily sparkle through the summer days:
4941,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And, dewlap-deep, here from the noontide heat"
4942,THE OLD WATER MILL,The bell-hung cattle find a cool retreat;
4943,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And through the willows girdling the hill,"
4944,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Now far, now near, borne as the soft winds will,"
4945,THE OLD WATER MILL,Comes the low rushing of the water-mill.
4946,THE OLD WATER MILL,
4947,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Ah, lovely to me from a little child,"
4948,THE OLD WATER MILL,"How changed the place! wherein once, undefiled,"
4949,THE OLD WATER MILL,The glad communion of the sky and stream
4950,THE OLD WATER MILL,Went with me like a presence and a dream.
4951,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Where once the brambled meads and orchardlands,"
4952,THE OLD WATER MILL,Poured ripe abundance down with mellow hands
4953,THE OLD WATER MILL,Of summer; and the birds of field and wood
4954,THE OLD WATER MILL,Called to me in a tongue I understood;
4955,THE OLD WATER MILL,And in the tangles of the old rail-fence
4956,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Even the insect tumult had some sense,"
4957,THE OLD WATER MILL,And every sound a happy eloquence:
4958,THE OLD WATER MILL,And more to me than wisest books can teach
4959,THE OLD WATER MILL,The wind and water said; whose words did reach
4960,THE OLD WATER MILL,"My soul, addressing their magnificent speech,--"
4961,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Raucous and rushing,--from the old mill-wheel,"
4962,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That made the rolling mill-cogs snore and reel,"
4963,THE OLD WATER MILL,Like some old ogre in a faerytale
4964,THE OLD WATER MILL,Nodding above his meat and mug of ale.
4965,THE OLD WATER MILL,
4966,THE OLD WATER MILL,How memory takes me back the ways that lead--
4967,THE OLD WATER MILL,As when a boy--through woodland and through mead!
4968,THE OLD WATER MILL,To orchards fruited; or to fields in bloom;
4969,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Or briery fallows, like a mighty room,"
4970,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Through which the winds swing censers of perfume,"
4971,THE OLD WATER MILL,And where deep blackberries spread miles of fruit;--
4972,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A wildwood feast, that stayed the plowboy's foot"
4973,THE OLD WATER MILL,When to the tasseling acres of the corn
4974,THE OLD WATER MILL,"He drove his team, fresh in the primrose morn;"
4975,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And from the liberal banquet, nature lent,"
4976,THE OLD WATER MILL,Plucked dewy handfuls as he whistling went.--
4977,THE OLD WATER MILL,
4978,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A boy once more, I stand with sunburnt feet"
4979,THE OLD WATER MILL,And watch the harvester sweep down the wheat;
4980,THE OLD WATER MILL,Or laze with warm limbs in the unstacked straw
4981,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Near by the thresher, whose insatiate maw"
4982,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Devours the sheaves, hot-drawling out its hum--"
4983,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Like some great sleepy bee, above a bloom,"
4984,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Made drunk with honey--while, grown big with grain,"
4985,THE OLD WATER MILL,The bulging sacks receive the golden rain.
4986,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Again I tread the valley, sweet with hay,"
4987,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And hear the bobwhite calling far away,"
4988,THE OLD WATER MILL,Or wood-dove cooing in the elder-brake;
4989,THE OLD WATER MILL,Or see the sassafras bushes madly shake
4990,THE OLD WATER MILL,"As swift, a rufous instant, in the glen"
4991,THE OLD WATER MILL,The red fox leaps and gallops to his den:
4992,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Or, standing in the violet-colored gloam,"
4993,THE OLD WATER MILL,Hear roadways sound with holiday riding home
4994,THE OLD WATER MILL,"From church or fair, or country barbecue,"
4995,THE OLD WATER MILL,Which half the county to some village drew.
4996,THE OLD WATER MILL,
4997,THE OLD WATER MILL,"How spilled with berries were its summer hills,"
4998,THE OLD WATER MILL,And strewn with walnuts all its autumn rills!--
4999,THE OLD WATER MILL,And chestnuts too! burred from the spring's long flowers;
5000,THE OLD WATER MILL,"June's, when their tree-tops streamed delirious showers"
5001,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of blossoming silver, cool, crepuscular,"
5002,THE OLD WATER MILL,And like a nebulous radiance shone afar.--
5003,THE OLD WATER MILL,And maples! how their sappy hearts would pour
5004,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Rude troughs of syrup, when the winter hoar"
5005,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Steamed with the sugar-kettle, day and night,"
5006,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And, red, the snow was streaked with firelight."
5007,THE OLD WATER MILL,Then it was glorious! the mill-dam's edge
5008,THE OLD WATER MILL,"One slope of frosty crystal, laid a ledge"
5009,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of pearl across; above which, sleeted trees"
5010,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Tossed arms of ice, that, clashing in the breeze,"
5011,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Tinkled the ringing creek with icicles,"
5012,THE OLD WATER MILL,Thin as the peal of far-off elfin bells:
5013,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A sound that in my city dreams I hear,"
5014,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That brings before me, under skies that clear,"
5015,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The old mill in its winter garb of snow,"
5016,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Its frozen wheel like a hoar beard below,"
5017,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And its west windows, two deep eyes aglow."
5018,THE OLD WATER MILL,
5019,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Ah, ancient mill, still do I picture o'er"
5020,THE OLD WATER MILL,Thy cobwebbed stairs and loft and grain-strewn floor;
5021,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Thy door,--like some brown, honest hand of toil,"
5022,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And honorable with service of the soil,--"
5023,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Forever open; to which, on his back"
5024,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The prosperous farmer bears his bursting sack,"
5025,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And while the miller measures out his toll,"
5026,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Again I hear, above the cogs' loud roll,--"
5027,THE OLD WATER MILL,"That makes stout joist and rafter groan and sway,--"
5028,THE OLD WATER MILL,The harmless gossip of the passing day:
5029,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Good country talk, that says how so-and-so"
5030,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Lived, died, or wedded: how curculio"
5031,THE OLD WATER MILL,"And codling-moth play havoc with the fruit,"
5032,THE OLD WATER MILL,Smut ruins the corn and blight the grapes to boot:
5033,THE OLD WATER MILL,Or what is news from town: next county fair:
5034,THE OLD WATER MILL,How well the crops are looking everywhere:--
5035,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Now this, now that, on which their interests fix,"
5036,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Prospects for rain or frost, and politics."
5037,THE OLD WATER MILL,"While, all around, the sweet smell of the meal"
5038,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Filters, warm-pouring from the rolling wheel"
5039,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Into the bin; beside which, mealy white,"
5040,THE OLD WATER MILL,"The miller looms, dim in the dusty light."
5041,THE OLD WATER MILL,
5042,THE OLD WATER MILL,Again I see the miller's home between
5043,THE OLD WATER MILL,The crinkling creek and hills of beechen green:
5044,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Again the miller greets me, gaunt and brown,"
5045,THE OLD WATER MILL,Who oft o'erawed my boyhood with his frown
5046,THE OLD WATER MILL,And gray-browed mien: again he tries to reach
5047,THE OLD WATER MILL,My youthful soul with fervid scriptural speech.--
5048,THE OLD WATER MILL,"For he, of all the countryside confessed,"
5049,THE OLD WATER MILL,The most religious was and goodliest;
5050,THE OLD WATER MILL,"A Methodist, who at all meetings led;"
5051,THE OLD WATER MILL,Prayed with his family ere they went to bed.
5052,THE OLD WATER MILL,No books except the Bible had he read--
5053,THE OLD WATER MILL,At least so seemed it to my younger head.--
5054,THE OLD WATER MILL,"All things of Heaven and Earth he'd prove by this,"
5055,THE OLD WATER MILL,Be it a fact or mere hypothesis:
5056,THE OLD WATER MILL,"For to his simple wisdom, reverent,"
5057,THE OLD WATER MILL,"_""The Bible says""_ was all of argument.--"
5058,THE OLD WATER MILL,God keep his soul! his bones were long since laid
5059,THE OLD WATER MILL,Among the sunken gravestones in the shade
5060,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Of those dark-lichened rocks, that wall around"
5061,THE OLD WATER MILL,The family burying-ground with cedars crowned:
5062,THE OLD WATER MILL,Where bristling teasel and the brier combine
5063,THE OLD WATER MILL,With clambering wood-rose and the wildgrape-vine
5064,THE OLD WATER MILL,To hide the stone whereon his name and dates
5065,THE OLD WATER MILL,"Neglect, with mossy hand, obliterates."

5365,THE PARTING,Like some starved hag who sees her children freeze.
5366,THE PARTING,
5367,THE PARTING,Dry-eyed she waited by the sycamore.
5368,THE PARTING,Some stars made misty blotches in the sky.
5369,THE PARTING,And all the wretched willows on the shore
5370,THE PARTING,Looked faded as a jaundiced cheek or eye.
5371,THE PARTING,She felt their pity and could only sigh.

5373,THE PARTING,And then his skiff ground on the river rocks.
5374,THE PARTING,Whistling he came into the shadow made
5375,THE PARTING,By that dead tree. He kissed her dark brown locks;
5376,THE PARTING,And round her form his eager arms were laid.

5378,THE PARTING,
5379,THE PARTING,"And then she spoke, while still his greeting kiss"
5380,THE PARTING,Ached in her hair. She did not dare to lift
5381,THE PARTING,"Her eyes to his--her anguished eyes to his,"
5382,THE PARTING,While tears smote crystal in her throat. One rift
5383,THE PARTING,Of weakness humored might set all adrift.

6484,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Far in the woods had laughed obscene.
6485,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I had had naught to stay me with.
6486,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6487,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Then I dismounted. Better so.
6488,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And found that blind man at my rein.
6489,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And there the path stretched straight and plain.
6490,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I saw at once the way to go.
6491,THE BLACK KNIGHT,The forest road I used to know
6492,THE BLACK KNIGHT,In days when life had less of pain.
6493,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Then I dismounted. Better so.
6494,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6495,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I had but little time to spare,"
6496,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Since evening now was drawing near;
6497,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And then I thought I saw a sneer
6498,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Enter into that blind man's stare:
6499,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And suddenly a thought leapt bare,--"
6500,THE BLACK KNIGHT,What if the Fiend had set him here!--
6501,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I still might smite him or might spare.
6502,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6503,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I braced my sword: then turned to look:
6504,THE BLACK KNIGHT,For I had heard an evil laugh:
6505,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"The blind man, leaning on his staff,"
6506,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Still stood there where my leave I took:
6507,THE BLACK KNIGHT,What! did he mock me? Would I brook
6508,THE BLACK KNIGHT,A blind fool's scorn?--My sword was half
6509,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Out of its sheath. I turned to look:
6510,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6511,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And he was gone. And to my side
6512,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My horse came nickering as afraid.
6513,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Did he too fear to be betrayed?--
6514,THE BLACK KNIGHT,What use for him? I might not ride.
6515,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"So to a great bough there I tied,"
6516,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And left him in the forest glade:
6517,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My spear and shield I left beside.
6518,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6519,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My sword was all I needed there.
6520,THE BLACK KNIGHT,It would suffice to right my wrongs;
6521,THE BLACK KNIGHT,To cut the knot of all those thongs
6522,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"With which she'd bound me to despair,"
6523,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"That woman with her midnight hair,"
6524,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Her Circe snares and Siren songs.
6525,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My sword was all I needed there.
6526,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6527,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And then that laugh again I heard,"
6528,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Evil as Hell and darkness are.
6529,THE BLACK KNIGHT,It shook my heart behind its bar
6530,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Of purpose, like some ghastly word."
6531,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"But then it may have been a bird,"
6532,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"An owlet in the forest far,"
6533,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"A raven, croaking, that I heard."
6534,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6535,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I loosed my sword within its sheath;
6536,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"My sword, disuse and dews of night"
6537,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Had fouled with rust and iron-blight.
6538,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I seemed to hear the forest breathe
6539,THE BLACK KNIGHT,A menace at me through its teeth
6540,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Of thorns 'mid which the way lay white.
6541,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I loosed my sword within its sheath.
6542,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6543,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I had not noticed until now
6544,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"The sun was gone, and gray the moon"
6545,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Hung staring; pale as marble hewn;--
6546,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Like some old malice, bleak of brow,"
6547,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"It glared at me through leaf and bough,"
6548,THE BLACK KNIGHT,With which the tattered way was strewn.
6549,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I had not noticed until now.
6550,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6551,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And then, all unexpected, vast"
6552,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Above the tops of ragged pines
6553,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I saw a ruin, dark with vines,"
6554,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Against the blood-red sunset massed:
6555,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"My perilous tower of the past,"
6556,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Round which the woods thrust giant spines.
6557,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I never knew it was so vast.
6558,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6559,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Long while I stood considering.--
6560,THE BLACK KNIGHT,This was the place and this the night.
6561,THE BLACK KNIGHT,The blind man then had set me right.
6562,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Here she had come for sheltering.
6563,THE BLACK KNIGHT,That ruin held her: that dark wing
6564,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Which flashed a momentary light.
6565,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Some time I stood considering.
6566,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6567,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Deep darkness fell. The somber glare
6568,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Of sunset, that made cavernous eyes"
6569,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Of those gaunt casements 'gainst the skies,"
6570,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Had burnt to ashes everywhere.
6571,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Before my feet there rose a stair
6572,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Of oozy stone, of giant size,"
6573,THE BLACK KNIGHT,On which the gray moon flung its glare.
6574,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6575,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Then I went forward, sword in hand,"
6576,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Until the slimy causeway loomed,"
6577,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And huge beyond it yawned and gloomed
6578,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"The gateway where one seemed to stand,"
6579,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"In armor, like a burning brand,"
6580,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Sword-drawn; his visor barred and plumed.
6581,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And I went toward him, sword in hand."
6582,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6583,THE BLACK KNIGHT,He should not stay revenge from me.
6584,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Whatever lord or knight he were,"
6585,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"He should not keep me long from her,"
6586,THE BLACK KNIGHT,That woman dyed in infamy.
6587,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"No matter. God or devil he,"
6588,THE BLACK KNIGHT,His sword should prove no barrier.--
6589,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Fool! who would keep revenge from me!
6590,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6591,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And then I heard, harsh over all,"
6592,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"That demon laughter, filled with scorn:"
6593,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"It woke the echoes, wild, forlorn,"
6594,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Dark in the ivy of that wall,"
6595,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"As when, within a mighty hall,"
6596,THE BLACK KNIGHT,One blows a giant battle-horn.
6597,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Loud, loud that laugh rang over all."
6598,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6599,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And then I struck him where he towered:
6600,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I struck him, struck with all my hate:"
6601,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Black-plumed he loomed before the gate:
6602,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I struck, and found his sword that showered"
6603,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Fierce flame on mine while black he glowered
6604,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Behind his visor's wolfish grate.
6605,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I struck; and taller still he towered.
6606,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6607,THE BLACK KNIGHT,A year meseemed we battled there:
6608,THE BLACK KNIGHT,A year; ten years; a century:
6609,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My blade was snapped; his lay in three:
6610,THE BLACK KNIGHT,His mail was hewn; and everywhere
6611,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Was blood; it streaked my face and hair;
6612,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And still he towered over me.
6613,THE BLACK KNIGHT,A year meseemed we battled there.
6614,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6615,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"""Unmask!"" I cried. ""Yea, doff thy casque!"
6616,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Put up thy visor! fight me fair!
6617,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I have no mail; my head is bare!
6618,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Take off thy helm, is all I ask!"
6619,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Why dost thou hide thy face?--Unmask!""--"
6620,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"My eyes were blind with blood and hair,"
6621,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"And still I cried, ""Take off thy casque!"""
6622,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6623,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And then once more that laugh rang out
6624,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Like madness in the caves of Hell:
6625,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"It hooted like some monster well,"
6626,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"The haunt of owls, or some mad rout"
6627,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Of witches. And with battle shout
6628,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Once more upon that knight I fell,"
6629,THE BLACK KNIGHT,While wild again that laugh rang out.
6630,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6631,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Like Death's own eyes his glared in mine,"
6632,THE BLACK KNIGHT,As with the fragment of my blade
6633,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I smote him helmwise; huge he swayed,"
6634,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Then crashed, like some cadaverous pine,"
6635,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Uncasqued, his face in full moonshine:"
6636,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And I--I saw; and shrank afraid.
6637,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"For, lo! behold! the face was mine."
6638,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6639,THE BLACK KNIGHT,What devil's work was here!--What jest
6640,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"For fiends to laugh at, demons hiss!--"
6641,THE BLACK KNIGHT,To slay myself? and so to miss
6642,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My hate's reward?--revenge confessed!--
6643,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Was this knight I?--My brain I pressed.--
6644,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Then who was he who gazed on this?--
6645,THE BLACK KNIGHT,What devil's work was here!----What jest!
6646,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6647,THE BLACK KNIGHT,It was myself on whom I gazed--
6648,THE BLACK KNIGHT,My darker self!--With fear I rose.--
6649,THE BLACK KNIGHT,I was right weak from those great blows.--
6650,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I stood bewildered, stunned and dazed,"
6651,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And looked around with eyes amazed.--
6652,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I could not slay her now, God knows!--"
6653,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Around me there a while I gazed.
6654,THE BLACK KNIGHT,
6655,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"Then turned and fled into the night,"
6656,THE BLACK KNIGHT,While overhead once more I heard
6657,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"That laughter, like some demon bird"
6658,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Wailing in darkness.--Then a light
6659,THE BLACK KNIGHT,Made clear a woman by that knight.
6660,THE BLACK KNIGHT,"I saw 'twas she, but said no word,"
6661,THE BLACK KNIGHT,And silent fled into the night.

6666,IN ARCADY,
6667,IN ARCADY,"I remember, when a child,"
6668,IN ARCADY,How within the April wild
6669,IN ARCADY,Once I walked with Mystery
6670,IN ARCADY,In the groves of Arcady....
6671,IN ARCADY,"Through the boughs, before, behind,"
6672,IN ARCADY,"Swept the mantle of the wind,"
6673,IN ARCADY,Thunderous and unconfined.
6674,IN ARCADY,
6675,IN ARCADY,Overhead the curving moon
6676,IN ARCADY,"Pierced the twilight: a cocoon,"
6677,IN ARCADY,"Golden, big with unborn wings--"
6678,IN ARCADY,"Beauty, shaping spiritual things,"
6679,IN ARCADY,"Vague, impatient of the night,"
6680,IN ARCADY,Eager for its heavenward flight
6681,IN ARCADY,Out of darkness into light.
6682,IN ARCADY,
6683,IN ARCADY,Here and there the oaks assumed
6684,IN ARCADY,"Satyr aspects; shadows gloomed,"
6685,IN ARCADY,"Hiding, of a dryad look;"
6686,IN ARCADY,"And the naiad-frantic brook,"
6687,IN ARCADY,"Crying, fled the solitude,"
6688,IN ARCADY,"Filled with terror of the wood,"
6689,IN ARCADY,Or some faun-thing that pursued.
6690,IN ARCADY,
6691,IN ARCADY,In the dead leaves on the ground
6692,IN ARCADY,Crept a movement; rose a sound:
6693,IN ARCADY,Everywhere the silence ticked
6694,IN ARCADY,As with hands of things that picked
6695,IN ARCADY,"At the loam, or in the dew,--"
6696,IN ARCADY,"Elvish sounds that crept or flew,--"
6697,IN ARCADY,"Beak-like, pushing surely through."
6698,IN ARCADY,
6699,IN ARCADY,"Down the forest, overhead,"
6700,IN ARCADY,"Stammering a dead leaf fled,"
6701,IN ARCADY,Filled with elemental fear
6702,IN ARCADY,Of some dark destruction near--
6703,IN ARCADY,"One, whose glowworm eyes I saw"
6704,IN ARCADY,"Hag with flame the crooked haw,"
6705,IN ARCADY,Which the moon clutched like a claw.
6706,IN ARCADY,
6707,IN ARCADY,Gradually beneath the tree
6708,IN ARCADY,Grew a shape; a nudity:
6709,IN ARCADY,Lithe and slender; silent as
6710,IN ARCADY,Growth of tree or blade of grass;
6711,IN ARCADY,Brown and silken as the bloom
6712,IN ARCADY,"Of the trillium in the gloom,"
6713,IN ARCADY,Visible as strange perfume.
6714,IN ARCADY,
6715,IN ARCADY,"For an instant there it stood,"
6716,IN ARCADY,Smiling on me in the wood:
6717,IN ARCADY,And I saw its hair was green
6718,IN ARCADY,"As the leaf-sheath, gold of sheen:"
6719,IN ARCADY,"And its eyes an azure wet,"
6720,IN ARCADY,From within which seemed to jet
6721,IN ARCADY,Sapphire lights and violet.
6722,IN ARCADY,
6723,IN ARCADY,Swiftly by I saw it glide;
6724,IN ARCADY,And the dark was deified:
6725,IN ARCADY,Wild before it everywhere
6726,IN ARCADY,Gleamed the greenness of its hair;
6727,IN ARCADY,"And around it danced a light,"
6728,IN ARCADY,"Soft, the sapphire of its sight,"
6729,IN ARCADY,Making witchcraft of the night.
6730,IN ARCADY,
6731,IN ARCADY,"On the branch above, the bird"
6732,IN ARCADY,Trilled to it a dreamy word:
6733,IN ARCADY,In its bud the wild bee droned
6734,IN ARCADY,"Honeyed greeting, drowsy-toned:"
6735,IN ARCADY,"And the brook forgot the gloom,"
6736,IN ARCADY,"Hushed its heart, and, wrapped in bloom,"
6737,IN ARCADY,Breathed a welcome of perfume.
6738,IN ARCADY,
6739,IN ARCADY,To its beauty bush and tree
6740,IN ARCADY,Stretched sweet arms of ecstasy;
6741,IN ARCADY,And the soul within the rock
6742,IN ARCADY,Lichen-treasures did unlock
6743,IN ARCADY,As upon it fell its eye;
6744,IN ARCADY,"And the earth, that felt it nigh,"
6745,IN ARCADY,Into wildflowers seemed to sigh....
6746,IN ARCADY,
6747,IN ARCADY,Was it dryad? was it faun?
6748,IN ARCADY,Wandered from the times long gone.
6749,IN ARCADY,Was it sylvan? was it fay?--
6750,IN ARCADY,Dim survivor of the day
6751,IN ARCADY,"When Religion peopled streams,"
6752,IN ARCADY,"Woods and rocks with shapes like gleams,--"
6753,IN ARCADY,That invaded then my dreams?
6754,IN ARCADY,
6755,IN ARCADY,Was it shadow? was it shape?
6756,IN ARCADY,Or but fancy's wild escape?--
6757,IN ARCADY,Of my own child's world the charm
6758,IN ARCADY,That assumed material form?--
6759,IN ARCADY,"Of my soul the mystery,"
6760,IN ARCADY,"That the spring revealed to me,"
6761,IN ARCADY,There in long-lost Arcady?
