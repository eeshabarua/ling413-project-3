151,,A Song in Chinese Tapestries
152,,
153,,
154,,
155,,"""How, how,"" he said.  ""Friend Chang,"" I said,"
156,,"""San Francisco sleeps as the dead--"
157,,"Ended license, lust and play:"
158,,Why do you iron the night away?
159,,"Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound,"
160,,With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round.
161,,"While the monster shadows glower and creep,"
162,,"What can be better for man than sleep?"""
163,,
164,,"""I will tell you a secret,"" Chang replied;"
165,,"""My breast with vision is satisfied,"
166,,"And I see green trees and fluttering wings,"
167,,"And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings."""
168,,Then he lit five fire-crackers in a pan.
169,,"""Pop, pop,"" said the fire-crackers, ""cra-cra-crack."""
170,,He lit a joss stick long and black.
171,,Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred;
172,,"On his wrist appeared a gray small bird,"
173,,And this was the song of the gray small bird:
174,,"""Where is the princess, loved forever,"
175,,"Who made Chang first of the kings of men?"""
176,,
177,,And the joss in the corner stirred again;
178,,"And the carved dog, curled in his arms, awoke,"
179,,Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke.
180,,"It piled in a maze round the ironing-place,"
181,,And there on the snowy table wide
182,,"Stood a Chinese lady of high degree,"
183,,"With a scornful, witching, tea-rose face...."
184,,"Yet she put away all form and pride,"
185,,And laid her glimmering veil aside
186,,With a childlike smile for Chang and for me.
187,,
188,,"The walls fell back, night was aflower,"
189,,"The table gleamed in a moonlit bower,"
190,,"While Chang, with a countenance carved of stone,"
191,,"Ironed and ironed, all alone."
192,,And thus she sang to the busy man Chang:
193,,"""Have you forgotten...."
194,,"Deep in the ages, long, long ago,"
195,,"I was your sweetheart, there on the sand--"
196,,Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land?
197,,We sold our grain in the peacock town
198,,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown--
199,,Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown....
200,,
201,,"""When all the world was drinking blood"
202,,From the skulls of men and bulls
203,,"And all the world had swords and clubs of stone,"
204,,"We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees,"
205,,And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan.
206,,"And this gray bird, in Love's first spring,"
207,,"With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing,"
208,,Captured the world with his carolling.
209,,"Do you remember, ages after,"
210,,At last the world we were born to own?
211,,You were the heir of the yellow throne--
212,,The world was the field of the Chinese man
213,,And we were the pride of the Sons of Han?
214,,"We copied deep books and we carved in jade,"
215,,"And wove blue silks in the mulberry shade...."""
216,,
217,,"""I remember, I remember"
218,,"That Spring came on forever,"
219,,"That Spring came on forever,"""
220,,Said the Chinese nightingale.
221,,
222,,"My heart was filled with marvel and dream,"
223,,"Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam,"
224,,"Though dawn was bringing the western day,"
225,,Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away....
226,,"Mingled there with the streets and alleys,"
227,,"The railroad-yard and the clock-tower bright,"
228,,Demon clouds crossed ancient valleys;
229,,Across wide lotus-ponds of light
230,,I marked a giant firefly's flight.
231,,
232,,"And the lady, rosy-red,"
233,,"Flourished her fan, her shimmering fan,"
234,,"Stretched her hand toward Chang, and said:"
235,,"""Do you remember,"
236,,"Ages after,"
237,,Our palace of heart-red stone?
238,,Do you remember
239,,The little doll-faced children
240,,"With their lanterns full of moon-fire,"
241,,That came from all the empire
242,,Honoring the throne?--
243,,The loveliest fête and carnival
244,,Our world had ever known?
245,,The sages sat about us
246,,"With their heads bowed in their beards,"
247,,With proper meditation on the sight.
248,,Confucius was not born;
249,,We lived in those great days
250,,Confucius later said were lived aright....
251,,"And this gray bird, on that day of spring,"
252,,"With a bright bronze breast, and a bronze-brown wing,"
253,,Captured the world with his carolling.
254,,Late at night his tune was spent.
255,,"Peasants,"
256,,"Sages,"
257,,"Children,"
258,,"Homeward went,"
259,,And then the bronze bird sang for you and me.
260,,We walked alone.  Our hearts were high and free.
261,,"I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name,"
262,,I had a silvery name--do you remember
263,,"The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?"""
264,,
265,,Chang turned not to the lady slim--
266,,"He bent to his work, ironing away;"
267,,"But she was arch, and knowing and glowing,"
268,,And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him.
269,,
270,,"""Darling ... darling ... darling ... darling ..."""
271,,Said the Chinese nightingale.
272,,
273,,"The great gray joss on a rustic shelf,"
274,,"Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry,"
275,,"Sang impolitely, as though by himself,"
276,,Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale's cry:
277,,"""Back through a hundred, hundred years"
278,,"Hear the waves as they climb the piers,"
279,,"Hear the howl of the silver seas,"
280,,Hear the thunder.
281,,Hear the gongs of holy China
282,,How the waves and tunes combine
283,,"In a rhythmic clashing wonder,"
284,,Incantation old and fine:
285,,"'Dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons,"
286,,"Red fire-crackers, and green fire-crackers,"
287,,"And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.'"""
288,,
289,,"Then the lady, rosy-red,"
290,,Turned to her lover Chang and said:
291,,"""Dare you forget that turquoise dawn"
292,,"When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn,"
293,,And worked a spell this great joss taught
294,,Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught?
295,,From the flag high over our palace home
296,,He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam--
297,,A king of beauty and tempest and thunder
298,,Panting to tear our sorrows asunder.
299,,A dragon of fair adventure and wonder.
300,,We mounted the back of that royal slave
301,,With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave.
302,,"We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains,"
303,,We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains.
304,,To our secret ivory house we were bourne.
305,,We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions
306,,Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions.
307,,Right by my breast the nightingale sang;
308,,The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist
309,,That we this hour regain--
310,,Song-fire for the brain.
311,,"When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed,"
312,,"When you cried for your heart's new pain,"
313,,"What was my name in the dragon-mist,"
314,,"In the rings of rainbowed rain?"""
315,,
316,,"""Sorrow and love, glory and love,"""
317,,Said the Chinese nightingale.
318,,"""Sorrow and love, glory and love,"""
319,,Said the Chinese nightingale.
320,,
321,,And now the joss broke in with his song:
322,,"""Dying ember, bird of Chang,"
323,,"Soul of Chang, do you remember?--"
324,,Ere you returned to the shining harbor
325,,There were pirates by ten thousand
326,,Descended on the town
327,,"In vessels mountain-high and red and brown,"
328,,Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies.
329,,On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes.
330,,But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest;
331,,I stood upon the sand;
332,,With lifted hand I looked upon them
333,,"And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes,"
334,,And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again.
335,,"Deep, deep below the bay, the sea-weed and the spray,"
336,,"Embalmed in amber every pirate lies,"
337,,"Embalmed in amber every pirate lies."""
338,,
339,,Then this did the noble lady say:
340,,"""Bird, do you dream of our home-coming day"
341,,When you flew like a courier on before
342,,"From the dragon-peak to our palace-door,"
343,,And we drove the steed in your singing path--
344,,The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath:
345,,"And found our city all aglow,"
346,,And knighted this joss that decked it so?
347,,There were golden fishes in the purple river
348,,And silver fishes and rainbow fishes.
349,,"There were golden junks in the laughing river,"
350,,And silver junks and rainbow junks:
351,,"There were golden lilies by the bay and river,"
352,,"And silver lilies and tiger-lilies,"
353,,And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town
354,,By the black-lacquer gate
355,,Where walked in state
356,,The kind king Chang
357,,And his sweet-heart mate....
358,,With his flag-born dragon
359,,"And his crown of pearl ... and ... jade,"
360,,"And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade,"
361,,"And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown,"
362,,And priests who bowed them down to your song--
363,,"By the city called Han, the peacock town,"
364,,"By the city called Han, the nightingale town,"
365,,"The nightingale town."""
366,,
367,,"Then sang the bird, so strangely gay,"
368,,"Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray,"
369,,"A vague, unravelling, final tune,"
370,,Like a long unwinding silk cocoon;
371,,Sang as though for the soul of him
372,,Who ironed away in that bower dim:--
373,,"""I have forgotten"
374,,"Your dragons great,"
375,,Merry and mad and friendly and bold.
376,,Dim is your proud lost palace-gate.
377,,I vaguely know
378,,"There were heroes of old,"
379,,"Troubles more than the heart could hold,"
380,,There were wolves in the woods
381,,"Yet lambs in the fold,"
382,,Nests in the top of the almond tree....
383,,The evergreen tree ... and the mulberry tree ...
384,,"Life and hurry and joy forgotten,"
385,,Years on years I but half-remember ...
386,,"Man is a torch, then ashes soon,"
387,,"May and June, then dead December,"
388,,"Dead December, then again June."
389,,Who shall end my dream's confusion?
390,,"Life is a loom, weaving illusion..."
391,,"I remember, I remember"
392,,There were ghostly veils and laces...
393,,In the shadowy bowery places...
394,,With lovers' ardent faces
395,,"Bending to one another,"
396,,Speaking each his part.
397,,They infinitely echo
398,,In the red cave of my heart.
399,,"'Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart.'"
400,,They said to one another.
401,,"They spoke, I think, of perils past."
402,,"They spoke, I think, of peace at last."
403,,One thing I remember:
404,,"Spring came on forever,"
405,,"Spring came on forever,"""
406,,Said the Chinese nightingale.

419,,Where Is the Real Non-resistant?
420,,
421,,(Matthew 5:38-48)
422,,
423,,"Who can surrender to Christ, dividing his best with the stranger,"
424,,"Giving to each what he asks, braving the uttermost danger"
425,,"All for the enemy, MAN?  Who can surrender till death"
426,,"His words and his works, his house and his lands,"
427,,His eyes and his heart and his breath?
428,,
429,,Who can surrender to Christ?  Many have yearned toward it daily.
430,,"Yet they surrender to passion, wildly or grimly or gaily;"
431,,"Yet they surrender to pride, counting her precious and queenly;"
432,,"Yet they surrender to knowledge, preening their feathers serenely."
433,,
434,,"Who can surrender to Christ?  Where is the man so transcendent,"
435,,"So heated with love of his kind, so filled with the spirit resplendent"
436,,"That all of the hours of his day his song is thrilling and tender,"
437,,And all of his thoughts to our white cause of peace
438,,"Surrender, surrender, surrender?"
439,,
440,,
441,,
442,,Here's to the Mice!
443,,
444,,(Written with the hope that the socialists might yet
445,,dethrone Kaiser and Czar.)
446,,
447,,
448,,"Here's to the mice that scare the lions,"
449,,Creeping into their cages.
450,,Here's to the fairy mice that bite
451,,The elephants fat and wise:
452,,Hidden in the hay-pile while the elephant thunder rages.
453,,"Here's to the scurrying, timid mice"
454,,Through whom the proud cause dies.
455,,
456,,Here's to the seeming accident
457,,"When all is planned and working,"
458,,"All the flywheels turning,"
459,,Not a vassal shirking.
460,,Here's to the hidden tunneling thing
461,,That brings the mountain's groans.
462,,"Here's to the midnight scamps that gnaw,"
463,,Gnawing away the thrones.

465,,
466,,
467,,When Bryan Speaks
468,,
469,,"When Bryan speaks, the town's a hive."
470,,"From miles around, the autos drive."
471,,The sparrow chirps.  The rooster crows.
472,,The place is kicking and alive.
473,,
474,,"When Bryan speaks, the bunting glows."
475,,The raw procession onward flows.
476,,The small dogs bark.  The children laugh
477,,A wind of springtime fancy blows.
478,,
479,,"When Bryan speaks, the wigwam shakes."
480,,The corporation magnate quakes.
481,,The pre-convention plot is smashed.
482,,The valiant pleb full-armed awakes.
483,,
484,,"When Bryan speaks, the sky is ours,"
485,,"The wheat, the forests, and the flowers."
486,,And who is here to say us nay?
487,,Fled are the ancient tyrant powers.
488,,
489,,"When Bryan speaks, then I rejoice."
490,,His is the strange composite voice
491,,Of many million singing souls
492,,Who make world-brotherhood their choice.

503,,
504,,
505,,I.  Speak Now for Peace
506,,
507,,"Lady of Light, and our best woman, and queen,"
508,,"Stand now for peace, (though anger breaks your heart),"
509,,Though naught but smoke and flame and drowning is seen.
510,,
511,,"Lady of Light, speak, though you speak alone,"
512,,"Though your voice may seem as a dove's in this howling flood,"
513,,It is heard to-night by every senate and throne.
514,,
515,,Though the widening battle of millions and millions of men
516,,"Threatens to-night to sweep the whole of the earth,"
517,,Back of the smoke is the promise of kindness again.
518,,
519,,
520,,II.  Tolstoi Is Plowing Yet
521,,
522,,"Tolstoi is plowing yet.  When the smoke-clouds break,"
523,,High in the sky shines a field as wide as the world.
524,,There he toils for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.
525,,
526,,"Ah, he is taller than clouds of the little earth."
527,,"Only the congress of planets is over him,"
528,,And the arching path where new sweet stars have birth.
529,,
530,,"Wearing his peasant dress, his head bent low,"
531,,"Tolstoi, that angel of Peace, is plowing yet;"
532,,"Forward, across the field, his horses go."

536,,The Tale of the Tiger Tree
537,,
538,,"A Fantasy, dedicated to the little poet Alice Oliver Henderson, ten"
539,,years old.
540,,
541,,The Fantasy shows how tiger-hearts are the cause of war in all ages.
542,,It shows how the mammoth forces may be either friends or enemies
543,,of the struggle for peace.  It shows how the dream of peace
544,,is unconquerable and eternal.

549,I,"Peace-of-the-Heart, my own for long,"
550,I,"Whose shining hair the May-winds fan,"
551,I,"Making it tangled as they can,"
552,I,"A mystery still, star-shining yet,"
553,I,Through ancient ages known to me
554,I,And now once more reborn with me:--
555,I,
556,I,This is the tale of the Tiger Tree
557,I,"A hundred times the height of a man,"
558,I,Lord of the race since the world began.
559,I,
560,I,"This is my city Springfield,"
561,I,My home on the breast of the plain.
562,I,"The state house towers to heaven,"
563,I,By an arsenal gray as the rain ...
564,I,"And suddenly all is mist,"
565,I,"And I walk in a world apart,"
566,I,In the forest-age when I first knelt down
567,I,"At your feet, O Peace-of-the-Heart."
568,I,
569,I,This is the wonder of twilight:
570,I,Three times as high as the dome
571,I,"Tiger-striped trees encircle the town,"
572,I,Golden geysers of foam.
573,I,While giant white parrots sail past in their pride.
574,I,The roofs now are clouds and storms that they ride.
575,I,And there with the huntsmen of mound-builder days
576,I,Through jungle and meadow I stride.
577,I,And the Tiger Tree leaf is falling around
578,I,As it fell when the world began:
579,I,"Like a monstrous tiger-skin, stretched on the ground,"
580,I,Or the cloak of a medicine man.
581,I,"A deep-crumpled gossamer web,"
582,I,Fringed with the fangs of a snake.
583,I,The wind swirls it down from the leperous boughs.
584,I,"It shimmers on clay-hill and lake,"
585,I,"With the gleam of great bubbles of blood,"
586,I,Or coiled like a rainbow shell....
587,I,I feast on the stem of the Leaf as I march.
588,I,I am burning with Heaven and Hell.

595,II,Peace-of-the-Heart we deeply adored
596,II,For the witchcraft hid in your eyes.
597,II,"Gift from the sky, overmastering all,"

2044,II,An Account of the Poem Games
2045,II,
2046,II,
2047,II,In the summer of 1916 in the parlor of Mrs. William Vaughn Moody;
2048,II,"and in the following winter in the Chicago Little Theatre,"
2049,II,"under the auspices of Poetry, A Magazine of Verse; and in Mandel Hall,"
2050,II,"the University of Chicago, under the auspices of the Senior Class,--these"
2051,II,Poem Games were presented.  Miss Eleanor Dougherty was the dancer
2052,II,throughout.The entire undertaking developed through the generous
2053,II,coöperation and advice of Mrs. William Vaughn Moody.  The writer is
2054,II,exceedingly grateful to Mrs. Moody and all concerned for making place
2055,II,for the idea.  Now comes the test of its vitality.  Can it go on in the
2056,II,absence of its initiators?
2057,II,
2058,II,"Mr. Lewellyn Jones, of the Chicago Evening Post, announced the affair"
2059,II,"as a ""rhythmic picnic"".  Mr. Maurice Browne of the Chicago Little Theatre"
2060,II,said Miss Dougherty was at the beginning of the old Greek Tragic Dance.
2061,II,Somewhere between lies the accomplishment.
2062,II,
2063,II,"In the Congo volume, as is indicated in the margins,"
2064,II,the meaning of a few of the verses is aided by chanting.
2065,II,"In the Poem Games the English word is still first in importance,"
2066,II,"the dancer comes second, the chanter third.  The marginal directions"
2067,II,of King Solomon indicate the spirit in which all the pantomime was
2068,II,"developed.  Miss Dougherty designed her own costumes, and worked out"
2069,II,"her own stage business for King Solomon, The Potatoes' Dance,"
2070,II,"The King of Yellow Butterflies and Aladdin and the Jinn (The Congo,"
2071,II,"page 140).  In the last, ""'I am your slave,' said the Jinn"" was repeated"
2072,II,four times at the end of each stanza.
2073,II,
2074,II,"The Poem Game idea was first indorsed in the Wellesley kindergarten,"
2075,II,by the children.  They improvised pantomime and dance for the Potatoes'
2076,II,"Dance, while the writer chanted it, and while Professor Hamilton C."
2077,II,Macdougall of the Wellesley musical department followed on the piano
2078,II,the outline of the jingle.  Later Professor Macdougall very kindly wrote
2079,II,down his piano rendition.  A study of this transcript helps to confirm
2080,II,the idea that when the cadences of a bit of verse are a little
2081,II,"exaggerated, they are tunes, yet of a truth they are tunes which can be"
2082,II,but vaguely recorded by notation or expressed by an instrument.
2083,II,The author of this book is now against instrumental music
2084,II,in this type of work.  It blurs the English.
2085,II,
2086,II,Professor Macdougall has in various conversations helped the author
2087,II,toward a Poem Game theory.  He agrees that neither the dancing
2088,II,nor the chanting nor any other thing should be allowed to run away
2089,II,with the original intention of the words.  The chanting should not be
2090,II,carried to the point where it seeks to rival conventional musical
2091,II,composition.  The dancer should be subordinated to the natural rhythms
2092,II,"of English speech, and not attempt to incorporate bodily all the"
2093,II,precedents of professional dancing.
2094,II,
2095,II,"Speaking generally, poetic ideas can be conveyed word by word, faster"
2096,II,than musical feeling.  The repetitions in the Poem Games are to keep
2097,II,"the singing, the dancing and the ideas at one pace.  The repetitions may"
2098,II,be  varied according to the necessities of the individual dancer.
2099,II,Dancing is slower than poetry and faster than music in developing the
2100,II,"same thoughts.  In folk dances and vaudeville, the verse, music, and"
2101,II,dancing are on so simple a basis the time elements can be easily
2102,II,combined.  Likewise the rhythms and the other elements.
2103,II,
2104,II,"Miss Dougherty is particularly illustrative in her pantomime,"
2105,II,but there were many verses she looked over and rejected because
2106,II,they could not be rendered without blurring the original intent.
2107,II,"Possibly every poem in the world has its dancer somewhere waiting,"
2108,II,who can dance but that one poem.  Certainly those poems would be
2109,II,"most successful in games, where the tone color is so close to the"
2110,II,meaning that any exaggeration of that color by dancing and chanting
2111,II,only makes the story clearer.  The writer would like to see some one
2112,II,"try Dryden's Alexander's Feast, or Swinburne's Atalanta in Calydon."
2113,II,Certainly in those poems the decorative rhythm and the meaning
2114,II,are absolutely one.
2115,II,
2116,II,"With no dancing evolutions, the author of this book"
2117,II,has chanted John Brown and King Solomon for the last two years
2118,II,for many audiences.  It took but a minute to teach the people the
2119,II,responses.  As a rule they had no advance notice they were going to sing.
2120,II,"The versifier sang the parts of the King and Queen in turn,"
2121,II,"and found each audience perfectly willing to be the oxen, the"
2122,II,"sweethearts, the swans, the sons, the shepherds, etc."
2123,II,
2124,II,A year ago the writer had the honor of chanting for the Florence
2125,II,Fleming Noyes school of dancers.  In one short evening they made the
2126,II,"first section of the Congo into an incantation, the King Solomon into"
2127,II,"an extraordinarily graceful series of tableaus, and the Potatoes'"
2128,II,Dance into a veritable whirlwind.  Later came the more elaborately
2129,II,prepared Chicago experiment.
2130,II,
2131,II,In the King of Yellow Butterflies and the Potatoes' Dance Miss
2132,II,"Dougherty occupied the entire eye of the audience and interpreted,"
2133,II,"while the versifier chanted the poems as a semi-invisible orchestra,"
2134,II,by the side of the curtain.  For Aladdin and for King Solomon
2135,II,"Miss Dougherty and the writer divided the stage between them,"
2136,II,but the author was little more than the orchestra.  The main intention
2137,II,"was carried out, which was to combine the work of the dancer"
2138,II,with the words of the production and the responses of the audience.
2139,II,
2140,II,The present rhymer has no ambitions as a stage manager.  The Poem Game
2141,II,"idea, in its rhythmic picnic stage, is recommended to amateurs, its"
2142,II,further development to be on their own initiative.  Informal parties
2143,II,might divide into groups of dancers and groups of chanters.  The whole
2144,II,might be worked out in the spirit in which children play King William
2145,II,"was King James' Son, London Bridge, or As We Go Round the Mulberry Bush."
2146,II,"And the author of this book would certainly welcome the tragic dance,"
2147,II,"if Miss Dougherty will gather a company about her and go forward, using"
2148,II,"any acceptable poems, new or old.  Swinburne's Atalanta in Calydon is"
2149,II,perhaps the most literal and rhythmic example of the idea we have in
2150,II,"English, though it may not be available when tried out."
2151,II,
2152,II,"The main revolution necessary for dancing improvisers, who would go a"
2153,II,"longer way with the Poem Game idea, is to shake off the Isadora Duncan"
2154,II,"and the Russian precedents for a while, and abolish the orchestra and"
2155,II,"piano, replacing all these with the natural meaning and cadences of"
2156,II,"English speech.  The work would come closer to acting, than dancing is"
2157,II,now conceived.
