39,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
40,PREFACE.,
41,PREFACE.,
42,PREFACE.,"The first question which I asked myself, when I resumed a purpose long"
43,PREFACE.,"ago entertained, and then for a long while laid aside, of publishing"
44,PREFACE.,"such a selection of English Poetry as the present, was this, namely,"
45,PREFACE.,whether Mr. Palgrave’s _Golden Treasury_ had not so occupied the ground
46,PREFACE.,that there was no room for one who should come after. The selection is
47,PREFACE.,one made with so exact an acquaintance with the sources from which his
48,PREFACE.,"_Treasury_ was to be replenished, with so fine a taste in regard of what"
49,PREFACE.,"was worthy to be admitted there, that this was the conclusion to which"
50,PREFACE.,"at the first I was disposed to arrive. Presently, however, I saw reason"
51,PREFACE.,to change my mind. The volume which I meditated was on so different a
52,PREFACE.,"scheme and plan from his, that, while no doubt I should sometimes go"
53,PREFACE.,"over ground which he had gone over before, it was evident that for the"
54,PREFACE.,"most part our paths would be different, and my choice not identical with"
55,PREFACE.,"his. This to so great an extent has proved the case, that of more than"
56,PREFACE.,"three hundred pieces which compose this volume, less than seventy have"
57,PREFACE.,appeared in his. And it is easy to perceive how this should be. His is
58,PREFACE.,a _Treasury of the best songs and lyrical poems in the English
59,PREFACE.,"Language_, and of these exclusively; but within this circle he proposes"
60,PREFACE.,to include _all_ which is of first-rate excellence in our language by
61,PREFACE.,"authors not living. My scheme is at once broader and narrower; broader,"
62,PREFACE.,"in that I limit myself to no one particular class of poetry, and embrace"
63,PREFACE.,"the living and the dead alike; narrower, in that I make no attempt to be"
64,PREFACE.,"exhaustive, or to give more than a very few samples even of the best and"
65,PREFACE.,greatest of our poets.
66,PREFACE.,
67,PREFACE.,"But if Mr. Palgrave had not forestalled me, I certainly did not feel"
68,PREFACE.,that any other had so done. Most of the collections which have fallen
69,PREFACE.,under my eye have failed to give me the impression of being the result
70,PREFACE.,of direct and immediate investigation on the part of the collector into
71,PREFACE.,the treasures of our English Poetry. There is so much there which
72,PREFACE.,"invites citation, and which has never been cited yet in any of our"
73,PREFACE.,"popular anthologies, that it is difficult to think that any one who had"
74,PREFACE.,himself wandered in this garden of riches would not have carried off
75,PREFACE.,some flowers and fruits of his own gathering; instead of offering to us
76,PREFACE.,"again, as most do, though it may be in somewhat different combinations,"
77,PREFACE.,"what already has been offered by others. When I see, for example, ‘Queen"
78,PREFACE.,"and huntress chaste and fair,’ doubtless a very graceful lyric, with one"
79,PREFACE.,"or two other familiar poems, doing duty in one collection after another"
80,PREFACE.,"as the specimens of Ben Jonson’s verse, it is hard to suppose that his"
81,PREFACE.,rich and pleasant _Underwood_ has been wandered through; since in that
82,PREFACE.,case something which others have not brought already would surely have
83,PREFACE.,been brought away from thence; while the specimens from other poets
84,PREFACE.,"provoke a similar misgiving. Whatever merit or demerit this may imply,"
85,PREFACE.,"the volume here presented lays claim to a certain originality--or, if"
86,PREFACE.,"that word cannot in this matter be allowed,--to a certain independence"
87,PREFACE.,"of judgment. There has not, indeed, been any attempt, as certainly there"
88,PREFACE.,"has been no desire, to reverse the general judgment and decision about"
89,PREFACE.,the great poems of the language. He who should offer to do this would
90,PREFACE.,"merely betray his own presumption, and his unfitness for even so humble"
91,PREFACE.,"a task as that here attempted. But in poems of a very high merit, which"
92,PREFACE.,"yet do not attain to the highest rank of all, there is ample space for"
93,PREFACE.,"the play of such an independent judgment, and I have not hesitated to"
94,PREFACE.,"exercise this. Many, which almost all collections have hitherto"
95,PREFACE.,"contained, will be looked for in vain in this; not a few which, so far"
96,PREFACE.,"as I know, none have included, have found room in it. It is not always"
97,PREFACE.,that I have considered what I bring forward _better_ than what to make
98,PREFACE.,"place for it I set aside; but where I have only considered it as good,"
99,PREFACE.,it has seemed a real gain to put new treasures within the reach of those
100,PREFACE.,"who are little able, or, if able, are little likely, to go and discover"
101,PREFACE.,such for themselves. But in very many instances I feel sure that what I
102,PREFACE.,"have made room for is not merely as good, but better than that which to"
103,PREFACE.,make room for it I have dismissed; nor has it been a little pleasure to
104,PREFACE.,"draw from obscure retreats, or from retreats only familiar to those who"
105,PREFACE.,"have made English poetry more or less of a special study, and"
106,PREFACE.,"acquainted themselves with its bye ways no less than its high ways,"
107,PREFACE.,poems which little merit the oblivion into which they had fallen.
108,PREFACE.,
109,PREFACE.,"I have called this volume a _Household Book of English Poetry_, by this"
110,PREFACE.,"name implying that it is a book for all, that there is nothing in it to"
111,PREFACE.,prevent it from being confidently placed in the hands of every member of
112,PREFACE.,the household. I wish I could have kept it within a moderate size by no
113,PREFACE.,more than the excluding from it everything of inferior value; but it
114,PREFACE.,will be evident to all who are at all acquainted with the inexhaustible
115,PREFACE.,opulence of English Poetry that I could only do this by continual acts
116,PREFACE.,"of self-denial, having, at every step of my progress, to set my seal to"
117,PREFACE.,"the truth of that Eastern proverb which says, ‘You may bring a nosegay"
118,PREFACE.,"to the city, but you cannot bring the garden.’ This is indeed all which"
119,PREFACE.,in this anthology I have attempted. To have allowed it to grow to a
120,PREFACE.,larger bulk would have defeated my hopes that it might be a volume which
121,PREFACE.,"the emigrant, finding room for little not absolutely necessary, might"
122,PREFACE.,"yet find room for it in his trunk, and the traveller in his knapsack,"
123,PREFACE.,and that on some narrow shelves where there are few books this might be
124,PREFACE.,"one. But indeed the actual amount which such a volume contains, whether"
125,PREFACE.,"it be much or little, will be of less consequence in our eyes, when once"
126,PREFACE.,we have apprehended that Horace was only under the mark when he affirmed
127,PREFACE.,of good poetry that ten times repeated it will please. It would be truer
128,PREFACE.,"to say of a poem which in motive, in form, in diction, in melody, in"
129,PREFACE.,"unity of plan, satisfies all conditions, that it is ‘a joy for ever.’"
130,PREFACE.,It is impossible so to draw out the sweetness of it that it shall not
131,PREFACE.,"still have as much to yield us, or it maybe more than it had at the"
132,PREFACE.,"beginning. How many another book, once read, can yield no more pleasure"
133,PREFACE.,or profit to us--but poems of the highest order are in their very
134,PREFACE.,essence sources of a delight which is inexhaustible. However much of
135,PREFACE.,"this has been drawn from them, as much or more remains behind."
136,PREFACE.,
137,PREFACE.,There is another reflection which may console us in leaving so much
138,PREFACE.,"untouched, namely, that almost every considerable poet has written"
139,PREFACE.,"something, in which all that he has of highest and most characteristic"
140,PREFACE.,has come to a head. Thus I remember that Wordsworth used to speak of
141,PREFACE.,Shelley’s _Ode to a Skylark_ as the expression of the highest to which
142,PREFACE.,his genius had attained. Wordsworth’s own _Lines on revisiting the banks
143,PREFACE.,"of the Wye_, or, higher perhaps even than these, his _Lines suggested by"
144,PREFACE.,"a picture of Peele Castle in a Storm_, I should regard as fulfilling for"
145,PREFACE.,"him the same conditions; and what is true of these two, is no less true"
146,PREFACE.,of other poets out of number.
147,PREFACE.,
148,PREFACE.,"I have nowhere given extracts from larger poems, but only poems which"
149,PREFACE.,may be regarded as complete in themselves. It is true that I have
150,PREFACE.,"sometimes made room for such as, through their length, or through some"
151,PREFACE.,"other cause, must otherwise have been shut out, by omissions; but only"
152,PREFACE.,where I believed these omissions to be real gains; and I do not think I
153,PREFACE.,"have anywhere done this without giving warning to the reader. There are,"
154,PREFACE.,"no doubt, certain inconveniences which attend a resolution only to give"
155,PREFACE.,entire poems and not extracts; and this the chief one--that the space
156,PREFACE.,allotted to different poets cannot in all or nearly all instances
157,PREFACE.,represent or correspond to their several importance. Some poets have
158,PREFACE.,thrown all or well nigh all their poetic faculty into the composition of
159,PREFACE.,one or two great poems; and have very seldom indeed allowed themselves
160,PREFACE.,"in briefer excursions into the land of song. Others on the contrary, of"
161,PREFACE.,"not higher, or it may be not nearly so high, a gift, have put a large"
162,PREFACE.,"part of their strength into these occasional poems, and will therefore"
163,PREFACE.,yield for a volume like the present infinitely more than their more
164,PREFACE.,"illustrious compeers. Under the action of this rule, and dramatic poetry"
165,PREFACE.,"being of necessity excluded, there is nothing of Shakespeare’s to choose"
166,PREFACE.,from but his Sonnets and his Songs--these certainly being in themselves
167,PREFACE.,"much, but still little when compared with what is passed by. Again, one"
168,PREFACE.,"who does not believe in _Alexander’s Feast_, and still less in the _Ode"
169,PREFACE.,"on the Death of Mrs. Killigrew_, finds it hard, indeed impossible, to"
170,PREFACE.,"deal anything approaching to justice to Dryden, or by specimens which"
171,PREFACE.,are at his command to afford any true representation of the range of his
172,PREFACE.,powers or the eminence of his place in English literature. It is the
173,PREFACE.,"same and nearly to the same extent with Pope; while others, like Gray"
174,PREFACE.,"and Campbell, get justice and more than justice; though, yielding what"
175,PREFACE.,"they do, one does not grudge this to them in the least. The"
176,PREFACE.,"inconvenience would certainly be a grave one, if the volume presented"
177,PREFACE.,"itself as primarily a Manual of English Poetry, or an assistance to the"
178,PREFACE.,study of the history of this; but having quite another as its primary
179,PREFACE.,"object, it is one which may very well be borne, while the advantages of"
180,PREFACE.,such a rule of selection are undoubted.
181,PREFACE.,
182,PREFACE.,I have attached a few notes to this volume. I had intended to add many
183,PREFACE.,"more, but under the pressure of events which now claim, and for a long"
184,PREFACE.,"time to come are likely to claim, nearly all one’s thoughts and leisure,"
185,PREFACE.,"have been obliged to renounce the carrying of this intention out, and"
186,PREFACE.,only to print those which were ready. If in them there is little or
187,PREFACE.,nothing with which professed students of English literature are not
188,PREFACE.,"already familiar, I can only urge that this volume was not designed, and"
189,PREFACE.,"still less were the notes designed, for such; but for readers who,"
190,PREFACE.,"capable of an intelligent interest in the subject, have yet had neither"
191,PREFACE.,"time nor opportunity for special studies of their own in it, and who"
192,PREFACE.,must therefore rely more or less on the hand-leading of others; nor I
193,PREFACE.,trust shall I be found fault with that I have sometimes taken upon me in
194,PREFACE.,these notes to indicate what seemed worthy of special admiration; or
195,PREFACE.,sought in other ways to plant the reader at that point of view from
196,PREFACE.,which the merits of some poem might be most deeply felt and best
197,PREFACE.,"understood. If I am, I must plead in excuse that for myself in other"
198,PREFACE.,"regions of art, as in music or painting, where I have comparatively"
199,PREFACE.,"little or no confidence in my own judgment, I have been and often am"
200,PREFACE.,"most thankful to those, being persons whom I could trust, who have told"
201,PREFACE.,"me what to admire, and given me the reasons for so doing. If we set"
202,PREFACE.,"aside a few intuitive geniuses, it is only thus that any of us can ever"
203,PREFACE.,hope to be educated into independence of judgment; and I am sure that
204,PREFACE.,"some, acknowledging this, will be grateful for notes of admiration, by"
205,PREFACE.,which I have sometimes called their attention to that which otherwise
206,PREFACE.,"might not obtain it, or might not obtain it to the full of its deserts."

5438,_THE DREAM._,

5485,_THE DREAM._,(Love’s empire in Clorinda gone)
5486,_THE DREAM._,"Thought they were quit from Love’s command,                       55"

5513,_THE DREAM._,
5514,_THE DREAM._,"To such extremes did sorrow rise,"
5515,_THE DREAM._,"That it transcended speech and form,"
5516,_THE DREAM._,And was so lost to ears and eyes
5517,_THE DREAM._,As seamen sinking in a storm.                                     80
5518,_THE DREAM._,
5519,_THE DREAM._,"My soul, in sleep’s soft fetters bound,"

5942,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Instead of dirges this complaint;
5943,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"And for sweet flowers to crown thy hearse,"
5944,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Receive a strew of weeping verse
5945,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"From thy grieved friend, whom thou might’st see                    5"
5946,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Quite melted into tears for thee.
5947,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Dear loss! since thy untimely fate,"
5948,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My task hath been to meditate
5949,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"On thee, on thee: thou art the book,"
5950,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"The library whereon I look,                                       10"

5952,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"I languish out, not live, the day,"
5953,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Using no other exercise

5955,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,By which wet glasses I find out                                   15
5956,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,How lazily time creeps about
5957,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"To one that mourns; this, only this,"
5958,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My exercise and business is:
5959,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,So I compute the weary hours
5960,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,With sighs dissolvèd into showers.                                20
5961,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Nor wonder if my time go thus
5962,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Backward and most preposterous;
5963,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Thou hast benighted me; thy set
5964,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"This eve of blackness did beget,"
5965,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Who wast my day (though overcast                                  25
5966,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Before thou hadst thy noontide past),"
5967,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"And I remember must in tears,"
5968,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Thou scarce hadst seen so many years
5969,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,As day tells hours. By thy clear sun
5970,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My love and fortune first did run;                                30
5971,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,But thou wilt never more appear
5972,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Folded within my hemisphere,"

5976,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"The earth now interposèd is,"
5977,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Which such a strange eclipse doth make
5978,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,As ne’er was read in almanack.
5979,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,I could allow thee for a time
5980,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,To darken me and my sad clime;                                    40
5981,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Were it a month, a year, or ten,"
5982,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,I would thy exile live till then;
5983,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And all that space my mirth adjourn.
5984,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,So thou wouldst promise to return;
5985,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And putting off thy ashy shroud                                   45

5987,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,But woe is me! the longest date
5988,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Too narrow is to calculate
5989,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,These empty hopes: never shall I
5990,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Be so much blest as to descry                                     50
5991,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"A glimpse of thee, till that day come"
5992,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Which shall the earth to cinders doom,"
5993,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And a fierce fever must calcine
5994,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"The body of this world like thine,"
5995,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My little world! That fit of fire                                 55
5996,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Once off, our bodies shall aspire"
5997,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"To our souls’ bliss: then we shall rise,"
5998,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And view ourselves with clearer eyes
5999,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"In that calm region, where no night"
6000,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Can hide us from each other’s sight.                              60
6001,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Meantime, thou hast her, earth: much good"
6002,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,May my harm do thee. Since it stood
6003,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,With Heaven’s will I might not call
6004,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Her longer mine, I give thee all"
6005,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My short-lived right and interest                                 65
6006,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"In her, whom living I loved best:"
6007,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"With a most free and bounteous grief,"
6008,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,I give thee what I could not keep.
6009,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Be kind to her, and prithee look"
6010,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Thou write into thy Doomsday book                                 70
6011,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Each parcel of this rarity,"
6012,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Which in thy casket shrined doth lie:
6013,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"See that thou make thy reckoning straight,"
6014,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And yield her back again by weight;
6015,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,For thou must audit on thy trust                                  75
6016,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Each grain and atom of this dust,"
6017,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"As thou wilt answer him that lent,"
6018,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Not gave, thee, my dear monument."
6019,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"So close the ground, and ’bout her shade"
6020,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Black curtains draw; my bride is laid.                            80
6021,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Sleep on, my Love, in thy cold bed"
6022,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Never to be disquieted!
6023,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My last good night! Thou wilt not wake
6024,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Till I thy fate shall overtake:
6025,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Till age, or grief, or sickness must                              85"
6026,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Marry my body to that dust
6027,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,It so much loves; and fill the room
6028,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,My heart keeps empty in thy tomb.
6029,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Stay for me there; I will not fail
6030,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,To meet thee in that hallow vale.                                 90
6031,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And think not much of my delay;
6032,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"I am already on the way,"
6033,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And follow thee with all the speed
6034,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Desire can make, or sorrows breed."
6035,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Each minute is a short degree,                                    95"
6036,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And every hour a step towards thee.
6037,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"At night when I betake to rest,"
6038,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Next morn I rise nearer my west
6039,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Of life, almost by eight hours’ sail,"
6040,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Than when sleep breathed his drowsy gale.                        100
6041,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Thus from the sun my bottom steers,"
6042,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And my day’s compass downward bears:
6043,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Nor labour I to stem the tide,"
6044,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Through which to thee I swiftly glide.
6045,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"’Tis true, with shame and grief I yield,                       105"
6046,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Thou, like the van, first took’st the field,"
6047,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And gotten hast the victory
6048,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,In thus adventuring to die
6049,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Before me, whose more years might crave"
6050,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,A just precedence in the grave.                                  110
6051,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"But hark! my pulse, like a soft drum,"
6052,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Beats my approach, tells thee I come;"
6053,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"And slow howe’er my marches be,"
6054,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,I shall at last sit down by thee.
6055,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"The thought of this bids me go on,                             115"
6056,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,And wait my dissolution
6057,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,With hope and comfort. Dear (forgive
6058,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,The crime) I am content to live
6059,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,"Divided, with but half a heart,"
6060,_EXEQUY ON HIS WIFE._,Till we shall meet and never part.                               120

11414,_THE DANISH BOY._,A harp is from his shoulder slung;

11418,_THE DANISH BOY._,Of flocks upon the neighbouring hills
11419,_THE DANISH BOY._,He is the darling and the joy;

11421,_THE DANISH BOY._,"The mountain ponies prick their ears,"

11427,_THE DANISH BOY._,No trace of a ferocious air;
11428,_THE DANISH BOY._,Nor ever was a cloudless sky
11429,_THE DANISH BOY._,So steady or so fair.
11430,_THE DANISH BOY._,"The lovely Danish boy is blest,"

11432,_THE DANISH BOY._,From bloody deeds his thoughts are far;
11433,_THE DANISH BOY._,"And yet he warbles songs of war,"

11435,_THE DANISH BOY._,For calm and gentle is his mien;

13790,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We went up the beach, by the sandy down"

13792,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,            70"

13794,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,"

13797,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
13798,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:                       76
13799,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"‘Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here."
13800,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Dear heart,’ I said, ‘we are long alone."

13802,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"But, ah, she gave me never a look,                                80"
13803,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,For her eyes were sealed to the holy book.
13804,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,‘Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.’

13809,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Down to the depths of the sea.
13810,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
13811,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Singing most joyfully.
13812,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Hark, what she sings; ‘O joy, O joy,"
13813,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy,               90"
13814,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well,"
13815,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the wheel where I spun,"
13816,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the blessèd light of the sun.’
13817,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And so she sings her fill,"
13818,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Singing most joyfully,                                        95"
13819,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Till the shuttle falls from her hand,"
13820,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
13821,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand;"
13822,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And over the sand at the sea;
13823,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And her eyes are set in a stare;                             100
13824,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
13825,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And anon there drops a tear,"
13826,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
13827,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
13828,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"A long, long sigh,                                         105"
13829,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden,"
13830,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the gleam of her golden hair.
13831,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,
13832,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Come away, away, children,"
13833,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Come, children, come down."
13834,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"The hoarse wind blows colder,                            110"
13835,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Lights shine in the town.
13836,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,She will start from her slumber
13837,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,When gusts shake the door;
13838,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She will hear the winds howling,"
13839,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Will hear the waves roar.                                115
13840,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We shall see, while above us"
13841,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"The waves roar and whirl,"
13842,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"A ceiling of amber,"
13843,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"A pavement of pearl,"
13844,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Singing, ‘Here came a mortal,                            120"

13848,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,
13849,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"But, children, at midnight,"

13851,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,When clear falls the moonlight;
13852,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,When spring-tides are low:
13853,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,When sweet airs come seaward
13854,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,From heaths starred with broom;
13855,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And high rocks throw mildly                              130
13856,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,On the blanched sands a gloom:
13857,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Up the still, glistening beaches,"
13858,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Up the creeks we will hie;
13859,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Over banks of bright seaweed
13860,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,The ebb-tide leaves dry.                                 135
13861,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We will gaze, from the sand-hills,"
13862,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"At the white, sleeping town;"
13863,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,At the church on the hill-side--
13864,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And then come back down.
13865,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Singing, ‘There dwells a loved one,                      140"
13866,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,But cruel is she;

13965,A CHILD’S STORY.,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
13966,A CHILD’S STORY.,To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;

16101,_THE GRAVE._,I stood within the grave’s o’ershadowing vault;
16102,_THE GRAVE._,Gloomy and damp it stretched its vast domain;
16103,_THE GRAVE._,Shades were its boundary; for my strained eye sought
16104,_THE GRAVE._,For other limit to its width in vain.

16106,_THE GRAVE._,"Faint from the entrance came a daylight ray,                       5"

16110,_THE GRAVE._,
16111,_THE GRAVE._,"I lit a torch at a sepulchral lamp,"

16115,_THE GRAVE._,
16116,_THE GRAVE._,"Around me stretched the slumbers of the dead,"
16117,_THE GRAVE._,Whereof the silence ached upon mine ear;
16118,_THE GRAVE._,"More and more noiseless did I make my tread,                      15"

16121,_THE GRAVE._,"The former men of every age and place,"

16135,_THE GRAVE._,
16136,_THE GRAVE._,"Death’s various shrines--the Urn, the Stone, the Lamp--"

16140,_THE GRAVE._,
16141,_THE GRAVE._,"Unspoken tongues, perchance in praise or woe,"

16150,_THE GRAVE._,
16151,_THE GRAVE._,One place alone had ceased to hold its prey;

16157,_THE GRAVE._,The eternal calm wherewith the Tomb was bound;
16158,_THE GRAVE._,"Among the sleeping Dead alone He woke,"
16159,_THE GRAVE._,And blessed with outstretched hands the host around.
16160,_THE GRAVE._,
16161,_THE GRAVE._,"Well is it that such blessing hovers here,"
16162,_THE GRAVE._,To soothe each sad survivor of the throng                         50

16274,NOTES.,"was the author of this poem, and that the initials W. R. with which it"
16275,NOTES.,appears in Davison’s _Rhapsody_ indicate truly the authorship. It is
16276,NOTES.,abundantly worthy of him; there have been seldom profounder thoughts
16277,NOTES.,more perfectly expressed than in the fourth and fifth stanzas. A certain
16278,NOTES.,"obscurity in the poem will demand, but will also repay, study; and for"
16279,NOTES.,its right understanding we must keep in mind that ‘affection’ is here
16280,NOTES.,"used as in our English Bible, where it is the rendering of πἁθος (Rom."
16281,NOTES.,"i. 26; Col. 3, 5), and that ‘affection’ and ‘desire’ are regarded as"
16282,NOTES.,interchangeable and equivalent.

16284,NOTES.,"P. 4, No. iv.--See Spedding’s _Works of Lord Bacon_, vol. vii. p. 267"

16286,NOTES.,"certainly not lifting above all doubt, that the ascription of these"
16287,NOTES.,lines to Lord Bacon is a right one.
16288,NOTES.,
16289,NOTES.,"P. 6, No. vi.--This very remarkable poem first appeared in the second"
16290,NOTES.,"edition of Davison’s _Poetical Rhapsody_, 1608; itself a sufficient"
16291,NOTES.,disproof of the often-repeated assertion that Raleigh wrote it the night
16292,NOTES.,"before his execution, 1618. At the same time this leaves untouched the"
16293,NOTES.,question whether he may not at some earlier day have been its author.
16294,NOTES.,"There is a certain amount of evidence in favour of this tradition, which"
16295,NOTES.,"is carefully put together in Hannah’s _Poems by Sir Henry Wotton, Sir"
16296,NOTES.,"Walter Raleigh, and others_, 1845, pp. 89-98."

16302,NOTES.,"P. 21, No. xviii.--This sonnet is the first among the commendatory poems"
16303,NOTES.,prefixed to the original edition of _The Fairy Queen_. As original in
16304,NOTES.,"conception as it is grand in execution, it is about the finest"
16305,NOTES.,"compliment which was ever paid by poet to poet, such as it became"
16306,NOTES.,Raleigh to indite and Spenser to receive. Yet it labours under a serious
16307,NOTES.,defect. The great poets of the past lose no whit of their glory because
16308,NOTES.,"later poets are found worthy to share it. Petrarch in his lesser, and"
16309,NOTES.,"Homer in his greater sphere, are just as illustrious since Spenser"
16310,NOTES.,appeared as before.
16311,NOTES.,
16312,NOTES.,"P. 23, No. xx.--I have marked this poem as anonymous, the evidence which"
16313,NOTES.,ascribes it to Sir Walter Raleigh being insufficient to prove him the
16314,NOTES.,"author of it. It first appeared in _England’s Helicon_, 1600. In all"
16315,NOTES.,"known copies of this edition ‘Ignoto’ has been pasted over W. R., the"
16316,NOTES.,original signature which the poem bore. This may have arisen from a
16317,NOTES.,discovery on the part of the editor that the poem was not Raleigh’s; but
16318,NOTES.,also may be explained by his unwillingness to have his authorship of it
16319,NOTES.,declared; so that there is here nothing decisive one way or the other.
16320,NOTES.,"Other external evidence bearing on the question I believe there is none,"
16321,NOTES.,except Izaak Walton’s assertion fifty-three years later (_Complete
16322,NOTES.,"Angler_, 1653, p. 64) that it ‘was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his"
16323,NOTES.,younger days.’ No doubt then there was a tradition to this effect;
16324,NOTES.,"though ‘younger’ must not be pushed too far, as Raleigh was ten years"
16325,NOTES.,"older than Marlowe, to whose poem this is a reply. All that we can say"
16326,NOTES.,"is that there is no name in English literature so great, but that the"
16327,NOTES.,"authorship of these lines, if this could be ascertained, would be an"
16328,NOTES.,additional honour to it.--l. 21-24: In the _second_ edition of Walton’s
16329,NOTES.,"_Complete Angler_, 1655, this stanza appears--I should say, for the"
16330,NOTES.,"first time, were not this fact brought into question by its nearly"
16331,NOTES.,"contemporaneous appearance in a broad-sheet (see _Roxburgh Ballads_,"
16332,NOTES.,"vol. i. p. 205) which seems by its type to belong, as those expert in"
16333,NOTES.,"such matters affirm, to the date 1650-55. The stanza there runs,"

16335,NOTES.,‘What should you talk of dainties then!

16343,NOTES.,"P. 24, No. xxii.--Of this poem Dr. Guest (_History of English Rhythms_,"
16344,NOTES.,"vol. ii. p. 273) has said, ‘It appears to me extremely beautiful,’ a"
16345,NOTES.,judgment from which none who are capable of recognizing poetry when they
16346,NOTES.,see it will dissent. It is found in Campion’s _Observations on the Art
16347,NOTES.,"of English Poesy_, London, 1602. The purpose of the book is mainly to"
16348,NOTES.,prove that rhyme is altogether an unnecessary appendage to English
16349,NOTES.,"verse; that this does not require, and indeed is better without it. Had"
16350,NOTES.,"he offered to his readers many lyrics like this, he might have done much"
16351,NOTES.,more than by all his arguments he has done to bring them to his opinion.
16352,NOTES.,"As it is, the main value which the _Observations_ possess consists in"

16359,NOTES.,even under the artificial forms of a Platonic philosophy. They are
16360,NOTES.,"addressed to one, who, if the course of true love had run smooth, should"
16361,NOTES.,"have been his wife. When, however, through the misunderstanding of"
16362,NOTES.,"parents, or through some other cause, she had become the wife of"

16369,NOTES.,"before.’ It must be confessed that Drayton, who wrote far too much,"
16370,NOTES.,"wrote often below himself, and has left not a little to justify the"

16399,NOTES.,"poems which, as far as they go, leave nothing to be desired, he has"

16404,NOTES.,"Robert Southwell was a seminary priest, and was executed at Tyburn in"

16409,NOTES.,
16410,NOTES.,"P. 44, No. xlvi.--The judgment of one great poet on another his"
16411,NOTES.,"contemporary, must always have a true interest for us, and it was with"
16412,NOTES.,serious regret that I omitted Ben Jonson’s ever-memorable lines on
16413,NOTES.,"Shakespeare. Many things a contemporary sees, as none who belong to a"
16414,NOTES.,"later time can see them; knows, as none other can know; and even where"
16415,NOTES.,"he does not tell us much which we greatly care to learn about the other,"
16416,NOTES.,"he is sure to tell us something, whether he means it or not, about"
16417,NOTES.,himself and about his age. English literature possesses many judgments
16418,NOTES.,"of this kind. What Ben Jonson did for Shakespeare, Cartwright, a"
16419,NOTES.,"strong-thoughted writer if not an eminent poet, and more briefly"
16420,NOTES.,"Cleveland here, have done in turn for Jonson; Denham for Cowley; Cowley"
16421,NOTES.,for Crashaw; Carew for Donne; Marvell for Milton; Dryden for Oldham.
16422,NOTES.,There is not one of these which may not be read with profit by the
16423,NOTES.,careful student of English literature; and certainly Cleveland must be
16424,NOTES.,allowed very happily to have seized here some of the main excellences of
16425,NOTES.,Jonson.

16427,NOTES.,"P. 45, No. xlvii.--Another poem on the same subject, in Byrd’s _Psalms,"
16428,NOTES.,"Sonnets, and Songs_, is as a whole inferior to this, but yields one"
16429,NOTES.,stanza which is equal in merit to any here:
16430,NOTES.,

16432,NOTES.,I wander not to seek for more;
16433,NOTES.,I like the plain; I climb no hill;

16438,NOTES.,"P. 46, No. xlix.--Shakespeare’s Sonnets are so heavily laden with"
16439,NOTES.,"meaning, so double-shotted, if one may so speak, with thought, so"
16440,NOTES.,"penetrated and pervaded with a repressed passion, that, packed as all"
16441,NOTES.,"this is into narrowest limits, it sometimes imparts no little obscurity"
16442,NOTES.,to them; and they often require to be heard or read not once but many
16443,NOTES.,"times, in fact to be studied, before they reveal to us all the treasures"
16444,NOTES.,of thought and feeling which they contain. It is eminently so with this
16445,NOTES.,"one. The subject, the bitter delusion of all sinful pleasures, the"
16446,NOTES.,"reaction of a swift remorse which inevitably dogs them, Shakespeare must"
16447,NOTES.,"have most deeply felt, as he has expressed himself upon it most"
16448,NOTES.,profoundly. I know no picture of this at all so terrible in its truth as
16449,NOTES.,in _The Rape of Lucrece_ the description of Tarquin after he has
16450,NOTES.,successfully wrought his deed of shame. But this sonnet on the same
16451,NOTES.,theme is worthy to stand by its side.

16485,NOTES.,"virtually invented English poetry, or one might almost say, the English"
16486,NOTES.,language; since an editor of his poems (1690) could write that his was
16487,NOTES.,‘a name that carries everything in it that is either great or graceful
16488,NOTES.,"in poetry. He was indeed the parent of English verse, and the first that"
16489,NOTES.,showed us our tongue had beauty and numbers in it. The tongue came into
16490,NOTES.,"his hands like a rough diamond; he polished it first, and to that degree"
16491,NOTES.,that all artists since him have admired the workmanship without
16492,NOTES.,pretending to mend it.’ Compare the twenty-two lines devoted to him in
16493,NOTES.,"Addison’s _Account of the greatest English Poets_, which includes"
16494,NOTES.,"Congreve, but not Shakespeare! For myself, I confess that I did not find"
16495,NOTES.,it very easy to select from the whole range of his poems one which I

16509,NOTES.,and few more graceful records of a noble attachment than that which is

16511,NOTES.,"of his happy love. Phillips, writing in 1675, says, ‘His poems are now"

16528,NOTES.,They are so far beyond all doubt the greatest in the language that it is

16569,NOTES.,
16570,NOTES.,"P. 83, No. lxxxv. l. 133, 134: These lines are very perplexing. Milton’s"
16571,NOTES.,lines on Shakespeare abundantly attest that the true character of the
16572,NOTES.,greatness of England’s greatest poet rose distinct and clear before the
16573,NOTES.,mind of him who in greatness approached him the nearest. But in this
16574,NOTES.,couplet can we trace any sense of the same discernment? ‘Fancy’s child’
16575,NOTES.,"may pass, seeing that ‘fancy’ and ‘imagination’ were not effectually"
16576,NOTES.,"desynonymized when Milton wrote; nay, ‘fancy’ was for him the greater"
16577,NOTES.,"name (see _Paradise Lost_, v. 100-113). ‘Sweetest’ Shakespeare"
16578,NOTES.,"undoubtedly was, but then the sweetness is so drawn up into the power,"
16579,NOTES.,that this is about the last epithet one would be disposed to use about
16580,NOTES.,him. And then what could Milton possibly have intended by ‘his native
16581,NOTES.,"woodnotes wild’--the sort of praise which might be bestowed, though with"
16582,NOTES.,"no eminent fulness, upon Clare, or a poet of his rank. The _Midsummer"
16583,NOTES.,Night’s Dream_ and _As You Like It_ are perhaps the most idyllic of his
16584,NOTES.,plays; but the perfect art controlling at every step the prodigality of
16585,NOTES.,"nature, in these as in all his works, takes away all fitness from"
16586,NOTES.,"language such as this, and I can only wonder that of all the"
16587,NOTES.,commentators on Milton not one has cared to explain to us what the poet
16588,NOTES.,here meant.

16594,NOTES.,"presumed to be beautiful no less. Milton did not, as some say, invent"
16595,NOTES.,"the sister. Mention is made of her, her name is Hemera (Ήμἑρα), in"

16617,NOTES.,"abundantly deserving the oblivion into which it has fallen, but some of"
16618,NOTES.,"a very rare excellence in its kind. This he does, quoting largely from"
16619,NOTES.,"his _Ode to Winter_, mainly with the purpose of illustrating the"
16620,NOTES.,"distinction between fancy, of which these poems, in his judgment, have"
16621,NOTES.,"much, and imagination, of which they have little or none. They have a"
16622,NOTES.,merit which certainly strikes me more than any singular wealth of fancy
16623,NOTES.,which I can find in them; and which to Wordsworth also must have
16624,NOTES.,"constituted their chief attraction, namely, the admirable English in"
16625,NOTES.,"which they are written. They are sometimes prosaic, sometimes blemished"
16626,NOTES.,"by more serious faults; but for homely vigour and purity of language,"
16627,NOTES.,for the total absence of any attempt to conceal the deficiency of strong
16628,NOTES.,and high imagination by a false poetic diction--purple rags torn from
16629,NOTES.,"other men’s garments, and sewn upon his own--he may take his place among"
16630,NOTES.,the foremost masters of the tongue. Coleridge has said as much
16631,NOTES.,"(_Biographia Literaria_, vol. ii. p. 96): ‘There are not a few poems in"
16632,NOTES.,that volume [the works of Cotton] replete with every excellence of
16633,NOTES.,"thought, image, and passion which we expect or desire in the poetry of"
16634,NOTES.,"the milder Muse, and yet so worded that the reader sees no reason either"
16635,NOTES.,in the selection or the order of the words why he may not have said the
16636,NOTES.,"very same in an appropriate conversation, and cannot conceive how indeed"
16637,NOTES.,"he could have expressed such thoughts otherwise, without loss or injury"
16638,NOTES.,to his meaning.’ I will add that this poem is drawn out to too great a

16728,NOTES.,"P. 112, No. cii.--I have dealt somewhat boldly with this poem, of its"
16729,NOTES.,"twenty-four triplets omitting all but ten, these ten seeming to me to"
16730,NOTES.,"constitute a fine poem, which the entire twenty-four altogether fail to"
16731,NOTES.,"do. Few, I think, will agree with Horace Walpole that ‘the poetry is"
16732,NOTES.,"most uncouth and inharmonious;’ so far from this, it has a very solemn"
16733,NOTES.,and majestic flow. Nor do I doubt that these lines are what they profess
16734,NOTES.,"to be, the composition of King Charles; their authenticity is stamped on"
16735,NOTES.,every line. We are indebted to Burnet for their preservation. He gives
16736,NOTES.,"them in his _Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton_, saying, ‘A very worthy"
16737,NOTES.,gentleman who had the honour of waiting on him then [at Carisbrook
16738,NOTES.,"Castle], and was much trusted by him, copied them out from the original,"
16739,NOTES.,who avoucheth them to be a true copy.’--l. 2: A word has evidently
16740,NOTES.,"dropped out here, which is manifestly wanted by the metre, and, as it"
16741,NOTES.,"seems to me, also by the sense. I have enclosed within brackets the"
16742,NOTES.,‘earthly’ with which I have ventured to supply the want.
16743,NOTES.,
16744,NOTES.,"P. 113, No. ciii.--Marvell showed how well he understood what he was"
16745,NOTES.,"giving to the world in this ode, one of the least known but among the"
16746,NOTES.,"grandest which the English language possesses, when he called it"
16747,NOTES.,‘Horatian.’ In its whole treatment it reminds us of the highest to which
16748,NOTES.,"the greatest Latin Artist in lyrical poetry did, when at his best,"
16749,NOTES.,"attain. To one unacquainted with Horace, this ode, not perhaps so"
16750,NOTES.,"perfect as his are in form, and with occasional obscurities of"
16751,NOTES.,"expression which Horace would not have left, will give a truer notion of"
16752,NOTES.,"the kind of greatness which he achieved than, so far as I know, could"
16753,NOTES.,from any other poem in the language be obtained.
16754,NOTES.,
16755,NOTES.,"P. 117, No. cv.--I have taken the liberty of omitting nine out of the"
16756,NOTES.,twenty-six stanzas of which this fine hymn is composed; I believe that
16757,NOTES.,it has gained much by the omission. The sense that a poor stanza is not
16758,NOTES.,"merely no gain, but a serious injury, to a poem, was not Cowley’s; still"
16759,NOTES.,"less that willingness to sacrifice parts to the effect of the whole,"
16760,NOTES.,"which induced Gray to leave out a stanza, in itself as exquisite as any"
16761,NOTES.,"which remain, from his _Elegy_; which led Milton to omit from the"
16762,NOTES.,Spirit’s _Prologue_ in _Comus_ sixteen glorious lines which may still be
16763,NOTES.,"seen in his original MSS. at Cambridge, and have been often reprinted in"
16764,NOTES.,"the notes to later editions of his Poems.--l. 45-56: Johnson has said,"
16765,NOTES.,urging the immense improvement in the mechanism of English verse which
16766,NOTES.,"we owe to Dryden and the little which had been done before him, ‘if"
16767,NOTES.,"Cowley had sometimes a finished line, he had it by chance.’ Let Dryden"
16768,NOTES.,"have all the honour which is justly his due, but not at the expense of"
16769,NOTES.,others. There are doubtless a few weak and poor lines in this poem even
16770,NOTES.,"as now presented, but what a multitude of others, these twelve for"
16771,NOTES.,"example, without a single exception, of perfect grace and beauty, and as"
16772,NOTES.,satisfying to the ear as to the mind.--l. 68: This line is certainly
16773,NOTES.,perplexing. In all the earlier editions of Cowley which I have examined
16774,NOTES.,"it runs thus,"
16775,NOTES.,
16776,NOTES.,"‘Of colours mingled, Light, a thick and standing lake.’"
16777,NOTES.,
16778,NOTES.,"In the modern, so far as they have come under my eye, it is printed,"
16779,NOTES.,
16780,NOTES.,‘Of colours mingled light a thick and standing lake.’
16781,NOTES.,
16782,NOTES.,The line seems in neither shape to yield any tolerable sense--not in the
16783,NOTES.,"first, with ‘Light’ regarded as a vocative, which, for the line so"
16784,NOTES.,"pointed, seems the only possible construction; nor yet in the second,"
16785,NOTES.,which only acquires some sort of meaning when ‘colours’ is treated as a
16786,NOTES.,"genitive plural. I have marked it as such, but am so little satisfied"
16787,NOTES.,"with the result, that, were this book to print again, I should recur to"
16788,NOTES.,"the earlier reading, which, however unsatisfactory, should not be"
16789,NOTES.,"disturbed, unless for such an emendation as carries conviction with it."
16790,NOTES.,
16791,NOTES.,"P. 120, No. cvi.--Hallam has said that ‘Cowley upon the whole has had a"
16792,NOTES.,"reputation more above his deserts than any English poet,’ adding,"
16793,NOTES.,"however, that ‘some who wrote better had not so fine a genius.’ This may"
16794,NOTES.,"have been so, but a man’s contemporaries have some opportunities of"
16795,NOTES.,judging which subsequent generations are without. They judge him not
16796,NOTES.,"only by what he _does_, but by what he _is_; and oftentimes a man _is_"
16797,NOTES.,more than he _does_; leaves an impression of greatness on those who come
16798,NOTES.,in actual contact with him which is only inadequately justified by aught
16799,NOTES.,"which he leaves behind him, while yet in one sense it is most true. Many"
16800,NOTES.,a man’s embodiment of himself in his writings is below himself; some
16801,NOTES.,"men’s, strange to say, is above them, or at all events represents most"
16802,NOTES.,transient moments of their lives. But I should be disposed to question
16803,NOTES.,"Mr. Hallam’s assertion, judging Cowley merely by what he has left behind"
16804,NOTES.,"him. With a poem like this before us, so full of thought, so full of"
16805,NOTES.,"imagination, containing so accurate and so masterly a sketch of the past"
16806,NOTES.,"history of natural philosophy, we may well hesitate about jumping to the"
16807,NOTES.,"conclusion that his contemporaries were altogether wrong, rating him so"
16808,NOTES.,"highly as they did. How they did esteem him lines like these of Denham,"
16809,NOTES.,"the fragment of a larger poem, not without a worth of their own, will"
16810,NOTES.,show:
16811,NOTES.,
16812,NOTES.,‘Old mother Wit and Nature gave
16813,NOTES.,Shakespeare and Fletcher all they have;
16814,NOTES.,In Spenser and in Jonson Art
16815,NOTES.,Of slower Nature got the start;
16816,NOTES.,"But both in him so equal are,"
16817,NOTES.,None knows which bears the happiest share.
16818,NOTES.,"To him no author was unknown,"
16819,NOTES.,"Yet what he wrote was all his own,"
16820,NOTES.,"He melted not the ancient gold,"
16821,NOTES.,Nor with Ben Jonson did make bold
16822,NOTES.,To plunder all the Roman stores
16823,NOTES.,Of poets and of orators.
16824,NOTES.,Horace’s wit and Virgil’s state
16825,NOTES.,He did not steal but emulate!
16826,NOTES.,"And when he would like them appear,"
16827,NOTES.,"Their garb, but not their clothes did wear.’"
16828,NOTES.,
16829,NOTES.,"l. 19-40: Compare with these the lines, inferior indeed, but themselves"
16830,NOTES.,"remarkable, and showing how strongly Cowley felt on this matter, which"
16831,NOTES.,"occur in his _Ode to Dr. Harvey_, the discoverer of the circulation of"
16832,NOTES.,the blood:
16833,NOTES.,
16834,NOTES.,"‘Thus Harvey sought for truth in Truth’s own book,"
16835,NOTES.,"The creatures; which by God Himself was writ,"
16836,NOTES.,And wisely thought ’twas fit
16837,NOTES.,"Not to read comments only upon it,"
16838,NOTES.,But on the original itself to look.
16839,NOTES.,"Methinks in art’s great circle others stand,"
16840,NOTES.,"Locked up together, hand in hand,"
16841,NOTES.,"Every one leads as he is led,"
16842,NOTES.,"The same bare path they tread,"
16843,NOTES.,"And dance like fairies a fantastic round,"
16844,NOTES.,But neither change their motion nor their ground.’
16845,NOTES.,
16846,NOTES.,"The same thought reappears, and again remarkably expressed, although"
16847,NOTES.,"under quite different images, in his _Ode to Mr. Hobbs_. These are a few"
16848,NOTES.,lines:
16849,NOTES.,
16850,NOTES.,"‘We break up tombs with sacrilegious hands,"
16851,NOTES.,Old rubbish we remove.
16852,NOTES.,"To walk in ruins like vain ghosts we love,"
16853,NOTES.,And with fond divining wands
16854,NOTES.,We search among the dead
16855,NOTES.,"For treasure burièd,"
16856,NOTES.,Whilst still the liberal earth does hold
16857,NOTES.,So many virgin mines of undiscovered gold.’
16858,NOTES.,
16859,NOTES.,Dryden in some remarkable lines addressed to Dr. Charleton expresses the
16860,NOTES.,same sense of the freedom with which Bacon had set free the study of
16861,NOTES.,"nature, and the bondage from which he had delivered it:"
16862,NOTES.,
16863,NOTES.,"‘The longest tyranny that ever swayed,"
16864,NOTES.,Was that wherein our ancestors betrayed
16865,NOTES.,"Their freeborn reason to the Stagirite,"
16866,NOTES.,And made his torch their universal light.
16867,NOTES.,"So truth, while only one supplied the State,"
16868,NOTES.,"Grew scarce and dear, and yet sophisticate;"
16869,NOTES.,"Still it was bought, like emp’ric wares or charms,"
16870,NOTES.,"Hard words, sealed up with Aristotle’s arms.’"
16871,NOTES.,
16872,NOTES.,l. 164-182: It ought not to be forgotten that this poem appeared first
16873,NOTES.,"prefixed to Sprat’s _History of the Royal Society of London_, London,"
16874,NOTES.,"1667. Though not published till the year 1667, the year of Cowley’s"
16875,NOTES.,"death, the book had in great part been printed, as Sprat informs us, two"
16876,NOTES.,"years before, which exactly agrees with Cowley’s statement here. The"
16877,NOTES.,"position which the poem thus occupied should be kept in mind, otherwise"
16878,NOTES.,the encomium on Sprat’s _History_ might seem dragged in with no
16879,NOTES.,"sufficient motive, and merely out of motives of private friendship. It"
16880,NOTES.,may be added that the praise is not at all so exaggerated as those who
16881,NOTES.,know Addison’s ‘tuneful prelate’ only by his verse might suppose. The
16882,NOTES.,"book has considerable merits, and Johnson speaks of it as in his day"
16883,NOTES.,"still keeping its place, and being read with pleasure. I only observed"
16884,NOTES.,"when it was too late to profit by the observation, that after l. 143,"
16885,NOTES.,"three lines occur, on this the first publication of the poem, which, by"
16886,NOTES.,"a strange heedlessness, have dropt out of all subsequent editions. They"
16887,NOTES.,are as follows:
16888,NOTES.,
16889,NOTES.,‘She with much stranger art than his that put
16890,NOTES.,"All the Iliads in a nut,"
16891,NOTES.,The numerous work of life does into atoms shut.’
16892,NOTES.,
16893,NOTES.,"P. 129, No. cix.--This chorus, or fragment of a chorus, from the"
16894,NOTES.,"_Thyestes_ of Seneca, beginning"
16895,NOTES.,
16896,NOTES.,"Me dulcis saturet quies,"
16897,NOTES.,
16898,NOTES.,"and ending with these remarkable lines,"
16899,NOTES.,
16900,NOTES.,"Illi mors gravis incubat,"
16901,NOTES.,Qui notus nimis omnibus
16902,NOTES.,"Ignotus moritur sibi,"
16903,NOTES.,
16904,NOTES.,seems to have had much attraction for moralists and poets in the
16905,NOTES.,"seventeenth century. Beside this paraphrase of it by Sir Matthew Hale,"
16906,NOTES.,"prefixed to one of his _Contemplations_, there is a translation by"
16907,NOTES.,"Cowley, and a third, the best of all, by Marvell, of which these are the"
16908,NOTES.,concluding lines:
16909,NOTES.,
16910,NOTES.,"‘Who exposed to others’ eyes,"
16911,NOTES.,"Into his own heart never pries,"
16912,NOTES.,Death’s to him a strange surprise.’
16913,NOTES.,
16914,NOTES.,"P. 130, No. cx.--I have detached these two stanzas from a longer poem of"
16915,NOTES.,which they constitute the only valuable portion. George Wither (‘a most
16916,NOTES.,profuse pourer forth of English rhyme’ Phillips calls him) was indeed so
16917,NOTES.,"intolerable a proser in verse, so overlaid his good with indifferent or"
16918,NOTES.,"bad, that one may easily forget how real a gift he possessed, and"
16919,NOTES.,sometimes showed that he possessed.
16920,NOTES.,
16921,NOTES.,"P. 131, No. cxii.--When Phillips, writing in 1675, styles Quarles ‘the"
16922,NOTES.,"darling of our plebeian judgments,’ he intimates the circle in which his"
16923,NOTES.,"popularity was highest, and helps us to understand the extreme contempt"
16924,NOTES.,"into which he afterwards fell, so that he who had a little earlier been"
16925,NOTES.,hailed as
16926,NOTES.,
16927,NOTES.,"‘that sweet seraph of our nation, Quarles,’"
16928,NOTES.,
16929,NOTES.,became a byeword for all that was absurdest and worst in poetry. The
16930,NOTES.,"reacquaintance which I have made with him, while looking for some"
16931,NOTES.,"specimen of his verse worthy to be cited here, has shown me that his"
16932,NOTES.,"admirers, though they may have admired a good deal too much, had far"
16933,NOTES.,better right than his despisers.--l. 25: ‘To vie’ is to put down a
16934,NOTES.,"certain sum upon a card; ‘to revie’ is to cover this with a larger, by"
16935,NOTES.,which the challenger becomes in turn the challenged.
16936,NOTES.,
16937,NOTES.,"P. 132, No. cxiii.--Milton’s lines on Shakespeare cannot properly be"
16938,NOTES.,"counted an epitaph. But setting those aside, as not fairly coming into"
16939,NOTES.,"competition, this is, in my judgment, the finest and most affecting"
16940,NOTES.,epitaph in the English language. Of Pope’s there is not one which
16941,NOTES.,"deserves to be compared with it. His are of art, artful, which this is"
16942,NOTES.,"no less, but this also of nature and natural. With all this it has"
16943,NOTES.,grievous shortcomings. Death and eternity raise other issues concerning
16944,NOTES.,the departed besides those which are dealt with here.--This epitaph
16945,NOTES.,"contains two fine allusions to Virgil’s _Æneid_, with which Dryden was"
16946,NOTES.,"of necessity so familiar. The first, that of l. 7-10 to book v. l."
16947,NOTES.,"327-338. At the games with which Æneas celebrates his father’s funeral,"
16948,NOTES.,Nisus and his younger friend Euryalus are among the competitors in the
16949,NOTES.,"foot-race; Nisus, who is winning, slips, and Euryalus arrives the first"
16950,NOTES.,"at the goal, and carries off the prize. In the four concluding lines"
16951,NOTES.,"there is a beautiful allusion to the well-known passage, book vi. l."
16952,NOTES.,"860-886, in which the poet deplores the early death of that young"
16953,NOTES.,"Marcellus, with which so many fair expectations of the imperial family"
16954,NOTES.,and of the Roman people perished.
16955,NOTES.,
16956,NOTES.,"P. 133, No. cxiv.--Elizabeth, wife of Henry Hastings, fifth Earl of"
16957,NOTES.,"Huntingdon, is the lady commemorated in this fine epitaph, ‘by him who"
16958,NOTES.,says what he saw’--for this is the attestation to the truth of all that
16959,NOTES.,"it asserts, which Lord Falkland, mindful of the ordinary untruthfulness"
16960,NOTES.,"of epitaphs, thinks it good to subscribe."
16961,NOTES.,
16962,NOTES.,"P. 136, No. cxix.--The writer of these lines commanded a vessel sent out"
16963,NOTES.,in 1631 by some Bristol merchants for the discovery of the North-West
16964,NOTES.,"passage. Frozen up in the ice, he passed a winter of frightful suffering"
16965,NOTES.,on those inhospitable shores; many of his company sinking beneath the
16966,NOTES.,hardships of the time. The simple and noble manner in which these
16967,NOTES.,"sufferings were borne he has himself left on record (Harris’s _Voyages_,"
16968,NOTES.,"vol. i. pp. 600-606); how too, when at length the day of deliverance"
16969,NOTES.,"dawned, and the last evening which they should spend on that cruel coast"
16970,NOTES.,had arrived--but he shall speak his own words:--‘and now the sun was
16971,NOTES.,"set, and the boat came ashore for us, whereupon after evening prayer we"
16972,NOTES.,assembled and went up to take a last view of our dead; where leaning
16973,NOTES.,"upon my arm on one of their tombs I uttered these lines; which, though"
16974,NOTES.,"perhaps they may procure laughter in the wiser sort, they yet moved my"
16975,NOTES.,young and tender-hearted companions at that time to some compassion.’ To
16976,NOTES.,"me they seem to have the pathos, better than any other, of truth."

16978,NOTES.,"P. 137, No. cxxi.--A few lines from this exquisite monody have found"
16979,NOTES.,"their way, but even these rarely, into some modern selections. The whole"
16980,NOTES.,"poem, inexpressibly tender and beautiful as it is, is included in"
16981,NOTES.,"Headley’s _Select Beauties_, 1810, but in no other that I know. Henry"
16982,NOTES.,"King, afterwards Bishop of Chichester, married Anne, the eldest daughter"
16983,NOTES.,"of Robert Berkeley; she probably died in 1624, and, as we learn from the"
16984,NOTES.,"poem itself (see vv. 28, 29), in or about her twenty-fourth year. It"
16985,NOTES.,"would be interesting to know whether this was the lady, all hope to"
16986,NOTES.,"whose hand he at one time supposed he must for ever renounce, and did"
16987,NOTES.,"renounce in those other lines, hardly less beautiful, which he has"
16988,NOTES.,"called _The Surrender_, and which will be found at p. 65 of this volume."

16991,NOTES.,
16992,NOTES.,"P. 141, No. cxxiii.--A rough rugged piece of verse, as indeed almost"
16993,NOTES.,all Donne’s poetry is imperfect in form and workmanship; but it is the
16994,NOTES.,"genuine cry of one engaged in that most terrible of all struggles,"
16995,NOTES.,"wherein, as we are winners or losers, we have won all or lost all. There"
16996,NOTES.,"is indeed much in Donne, in the unfolding of his moral and spiritual"
16997,NOTES.,"life, which often reminds us of St. Augustine. I do not mean that,"
16998,NOTES.,"noteworthy as on many accounts he was, and in the language of Carew, one"

17003,NOTES.,
17004,NOTES.,he at all approached in intellectual or spiritual stature to the great
17005,NOTES.,Doctor of the Western Church. But still there was in Donne the same
17006,NOTES.,"tumultuous youth, the same entanglement in youthful lusts, the same"
17007,NOTES.,"conflict with these, and the same final deliverance from them; and then"
17008,NOTES.,the same passionate and personal grasp of the central truths of
17009,NOTES.,"Christianity, linking itself as this did with all that he had suffered,"
17010,NOTES.,"and all that he had sinned, and all through which by God’s grace he had"
17011,NOTES.,victoriously struggled.
17012,NOTES.,
17013,NOTES.,"P. 142, No. cxxv.--There is a certain residue of truth in Johnson’s"
17014,NOTES.,"complaint of the blending of incongruous theologies, or rather of a"
17015,NOTES.,"mythology and a theology, in this poem--Neptune and Phœbus and Panope"
17016,NOTES.,"and the Fury mixed up with St. Peter and a greater than St. Peter, and a"
17017,NOTES.,fierce assault on the Clergy of the Church. At the same time there is a
17018,NOTES.,"fusing power in the imagination, when it is in its highest exercise,"
17019,NOTES.,which can bring together and chemically unite materials the most
17020,NOTES.,heterogeneous; and the fault of Johnson’s criticism is that he has no
17021,NOTES.,"eye for the mighty force of this which in _Lycidas_ is displayed, and"
17022,NOTES.,which has brought all or nearly all of its strange assemblage of
17023,NOTES.,"materials into harmonious unity--and even where this is not so, hardly"
17024,NOTES.,"allows us to remember the fact, so wondrous is the beauty and splendour"
17025,NOTES.,of the whole. But in weaker hands the bringing together of all which is
17026,NOTES.,"here brought together, and the attempt to combine it all in one poem,"
17027,NOTES.,would have inevitably issued in failure the most ridiculous.--l. 32-49:
17028,NOTES.,This and more than one other allusion in this poem implies that King
17029,NOTES.,"wrote verses, and of an idyllic character, as would seem. In his"
17030,NOTES.,"brother’s Elegy, contained in the same volume in which _Lycidas_ first"
17031,NOTES.,"appeared, as much, and indeed a good deal more is said:"
17032,NOTES.,
17033,NOTES.,‘He dressed the Muses in the brav’st attire
17034,NOTES.,That e’er they wore.’
17035,NOTES.,
17036,NOTES.,"If he wrote English verse, and it is difficult to give any other meaning"
17037,NOTES.,"to these lines, none of it has reached us. A few pieces of Latin poetry"
17038,NOTES.,bearing his name are scattered through the volumes of encomiastic verse
17039,NOTES.,"which were issued from Cambridge during the time that he, as Fellow and"
17040,NOTES.,"Tutor of Christ’s, was connected with it. They are only of average"
17041,NOTES.,"merit.--l. 50: A glorious appropriation of Virgil, _Buc_. x. 9, 10,"

17045,NOTES.,
17046,NOTES.,l. 132: Observe the exquisite art with which Milton manages the
17047,NOTES.,transition from the Christian to the heathen. He assumes that Alpheus
17048,NOTES.,and the Sicilian Muse had shrunk away ashamed while St. Peter was
17049,NOTES.,"speaking. In bidding them now to return, he implies that he is coming"
17050,NOTES.,down from the spiritual heights to which for a while he had been lifted
17051,NOTES.,"up, and entering the region of pastoral poetry once more.--l. 159-164:"
17052,NOTES.,These lines were for a long time very obscure. Dr. Todd in his learned
17053,NOTES.,"notes, to which I must refer, has done much to dissipate the obscurity,"

17055,NOTES.,
17056,NOTES.,"P. 148, No. cxxvi.--These lines are the short answer to a very long"
17057,NOTES.,"question, or series of questions, which Davenant has called _The"
17058,NOTES.,"Philosopher’s Disquisition directed to the dying Christian_. This poem,"
17059,NOTES.,"than which I know few weightier with thought, unfortunately extends to"
17060,NOTES.,"nearly four hundred lines--its length, and the fact that it appeals but"
17061,NOTES.,"to a limited circle of readers, precluding me from finding room for more"
17062,NOTES.,"than a brief extract from it, and that in this note; but it literally"
17063,NOTES.,abounds with lines notable as the following:
17064,NOTES.,
17065,NOTES.,"‘Tradition, Time’s suspected register,"
17066,NOTES.,That wears out Truth’s best stories into tales.’
17067,NOTES.,
17068,NOTES.,"I am well aware of the evil report under which Davenant labours, and"

17121,NOTES.,
17122,NOTES.,"P. 150, No. cxxviii.--This poem, apart from its proper beauty, which is"
17123,NOTES.,"very considerable, has a deeper interest, as containing in the germ"
17124,NOTES.,"Wordsworth’s still higher strain, namely his _Ode on Intimations of"
17125,NOTES.,Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood_. I do not mean that
17126,NOTES.,Wordsworth had ever seen this poem when he wrote his. The coincidences
17127,NOTES.,are so remarkable that it is certainly difficult to esteem them
17128,NOTES.,accidental; but Wordsworth was so little a reader of anything out of the
17129,NOTES.,"way, and at the time when his Ode was composed, the _Silex Scintillans_"
17130,NOTES.,"was altogether out of the way, a book of such excessive rarity, that an"
17131,NOTES.,explanation of the points of contact between the poems must be sought
17132,NOTES.,"for elsewhere. The complete forgetfulness into which poetry, which,"
17133,NOTES.,"though not of the very highest order of all, is yet of a very high one,"
17134,NOTES.,"may fall, is strikingly exemplified in the fact that as nearly as"
17135,NOTES.,possible two centuries intervened between the first and second editions
17136,NOTES.,of Vaughan’s poems. The first edition of the first part of the _Silex
17137,NOTES.,"Scintillans_ appeared in 1650, the second edition of the book in 1847."
17138,NOTES.,Oblivion overtook him from the first. Phillips in his _Theatrum
17139,NOTES.,"Poetarum_, 1675, just mentions him and no more; and knows him only by"
17140,NOTES.,"his _Olor Iscanus_, a juvenile production, of comparatively little"
17141,NOTES.,worth; yet seeing that it yields such lines as the following--they form
17142,NOTES.,"part of a poem addressed to the unfortunate Elizabeth of Bohemia, our"
17143,NOTES.,first James’ daughter--it cannot be affirmed to be of none:
17144,NOTES.,
17145,NOTES.,Thou seem’st a rosebud born in snow;
17146,NOTES.,A flower of purpose sprung to bow
17147,NOTES.,To heedless tempests and the rage
17148,NOTES.,Of an incensèd stormy age:
17149,NOTES.,
17150,NOTES.,And yet as balm-trees gently spend
17151,NOTES.,"Their tears for those that do them rend,"
17152,NOTES.,"Thou didst nor murmur nor revile,"
17153,NOTES.,But drank’st thy wormwood with a smile.’
17154,NOTES.,
17155,NOTES.,"As a divine Vaughan may be inferior, but as a poet he is certainly"
17156,NOTES.,"superior, to Herbert, who never wrote anything so purely poetical as"
17157,NOTES.,_The Retreat_. Still Vaughan would probably never have written as he
17158,NOTES.,"has, if Herbert, whom he gratefully owns as his master, had not shown"
17159,NOTES.,him the way.

17161,NOTES.,"P. 154, No. cxxxii.--This poem, so little known, though the work of one"
17162,NOTES.,"so well known, opens very solemnly and grandly, but does not maintain"
17163,NOTES.,itself altogether at the same height to the end. Even as I have given
17164,NOTES.,"it, the two concluding strophes are inferior to the others; and this"
17165,NOTES.,"declension would be felt by the reader still more strongly, if I had not"
17166,NOTES.,"at once lightened the poem, and brought it within reasonable compass, by"
17167,NOTES.,the omission of no less than six strophes which immediately precede
17168,NOTES.,"these. It bears date January 14, 1682/3; and was written at season of"
17169,NOTES.,great weakness and intense bodily suffering (see his _Life_ edited by
17170,NOTES.,"Sylvester, Part III. p. 192); but the actual life of the great"
17171,NOTES.,non-conformist divine was prolonged for some eight or nine years more.
17172,NOTES.,
17173,NOTES.,"P. 163, No. cxxxviii.--I have gladly found room in this volume, as often"
17174,NOTES.,"as I fairly could, for poems written by those who, strictly speaking,"
17175,NOTES.,"were not poets; or who, if poets, have only rarely penned their"
17176,NOTES.,"inspiration, and, either wanting the accomplishment of verse, or not"
17177,NOTES.,"caring to use it, have preferred to embody thoughts which might have"
17178,NOTES.,claimed a metrical garb in other than metrical forms. Poems from such
17179,NOTES.,authors must always have a special interest for us. To the former of
17180,NOTES.,"these classes the author of these manly and high-hearted lines belongs,"
17181,NOTES.,and another whose epitaph on his companions left behind in the Arctic
17182,NOTES.,regions is earlier given (see No. cxix.). Bacon (for who can deny to him
17183,NOTES.,"a poet’s gifts?) and, before all others as a poet in prose, Jeremy"
17184,NOTES.,"Taylor, belong to the second. It would be more difficult to affirm of"
17185,NOTES.,"Bishop Berkeley (see No. cxxxvii.), and of Sir Thomas Browne (see No."
17186,NOTES.,"cxxxi.), to which of these classes they ought to be assigned."
17187,NOTES.,
17188,NOTES.,"P. 166, No. cxxxix.--These lines, in their wit worthy of Lucian, and"
17189,NOTES.,"with a moral purpose which oftentimes Lucian is wholly without, are"
17190,NOTES.,"called A Fable, but manifestly have no right to the name. I have omitted"
17191,NOTES.,"six lines, but with reluctance, being as in fact they are among the most"
17192,NOTES.,moral lines in the whole poem.
17193,NOTES.,
17194,NOTES.,"P. 169, No. cxli.--This is a party ballad, and, rightly to understand"
17195,NOTES.,"it, we must understand the circumstances of which it assumes on our part"
17196,NOTES.,a knowledge. In 1727 Admiral Hosier blockaded Porto-Bello with twenty
17197,NOTES.,"ships; but was not allowed to attack it, war not having actually broken"
17198,NOTES.,"out with Spain, and, a peace being patched up, his squadron was"
17199,NOTES.,withdrawn. In 1740 Admiral Vernon took Porto-Bello with six ships. It
17200,NOTES.,was apparently a very creditable exploit; but Vernon being an enemy of
17201,NOTES.,"Walpole’s, and a member of the Opposition, it was glorified by them"
17202,NOTES.,beyond its merits. When they boasted that he with six ships had effected
17203,NOTES.,"what Hosier had not been allowed to attempt with twenty, the statement"
17204,NOTES.,"was a perfectly true one, but in nothing dishonourable to him or to his"
17205,NOTES.,"employers. Glover is here the mouthpiece of the Opposition, who, while"
17206,NOTES.,"they exalted Vernon, affected to pity Hosier, who had died, as they"
17207,NOTES.,"declared, of a broken heart; and of whose losses by disease during the"
17208,NOTES.,"blockade they did not fail to make the most. It is a fine ballad, and"
17209,NOTES.,will do for Glover what his _Leonidas_ would altogether have failed to
17210,NOTES.,"do. This we may confidently affirm, whether we quite agree with Lord"
17211,NOTES.,"Stanhope or not, that it is ‘the noblest song perhaps ever called forth"

17230,NOTES.,"is produced, than the unrhymed lyric, which very seldom perfectly"
17231,NOTES.,satisfies the ear. That Collins has so completely succeeded here is
17232,NOTES.,"itself a sufficient answer to Gray’s assertion that he ‘had a bad ear,’"
17233,NOTES.,"to Johnson’s complaint, ‘his lines commonly are of slow motion; clogged"
17234,NOTES.,"and impeded with a cluster of consonants.’ Collins, in whom those lines"

17238,NOTES.,"But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness,’"

17240,NOTES.,"has falsified the prediction of Gray. Writing of him and of Warton,"
17241,NOTES.,"who both had lately died, Gray passes this judgment upon them, ‘They"
17242,NOTES.,"both deserve to live some years, but will not.’ Half of this prophecy"
17243,NOTES.,has come true; and Warton cannot be said to have lasted to our time; but
17244,NOTES.,Collins has now won a position so assured that instead of the ‘some
17245,NOTES.,"years’ which were all that Gray would have allotted to him, we may"
17246,NOTES.,confidently affirm that he will live as long as any love for English
17247,NOTES.,poetry survives.

17252,NOTES.,"mistake, it has done so here; and may justly claim for these poems that"

17254,NOTES.,"Ambrose Philips, it is true, has a niche in _Johnson’s Poets_; but so"

17258,NOTES.,"who are strong enough to burst any cerements, that collection is rather"

17274,NOTES.,"‘And ye shall walk in silk attire,’"
17275,NOTES.,
17276,NOTES.,that they both first appeared as broad-sheets sold in the streets of
17277,NOTES.,"Edinburgh; and, justly popular as they both from the first have been, no"

17279,NOTES.,"however, though not claimed by Mickle, nor included by him in an edition"
17280,NOTES.,"of his poems published by himself, was after his death claimed _for_"
17281,NOTES.,"him, and Allan Cunningham thinks the claim to be fairly made out. It"
17282,NOTES.,mainly rests on the fact that a copy of the poem with alterations
17283,NOTES.,marking the text as in process of formation was found among his papers
17284,NOTES.,"and in his handwriting. Without inspection of the document, it is"
17285,NOTES.,impossible to say what value as evidence it possesses. Certainly
17286,NOTES.,everything else which we know of Mickle’s is rather evidence against his
17287,NOTES.,authorship of this exquisite domestic lyric than for it. Still I have
17288,NOTES.,not felt myself at liberty to disturb the ascription of it to him.
17289,NOTES.,
17290,NOTES.,"P. 189, No. clv.--The immense superiority of this poem over every other"
17291,NOTES.,"in the little volume of Hamilton of Bangour’s poems, which was published"
17292,NOTES.,"at Edinburgh in 1760, some six years after his death, is not easy to"
17293,NOTES.,account for. This poem has its faults; that it is a modern seeking to
17294,NOTES.,write in an ancient manner is sometimes too evident; but it is a tragic
17295,NOTES.,"story tragically told, the situation boldly conceived, and the treatment"
17296,NOTES.,marked by strength and passion throughout. Nothing else in the volume
17297,NOTES.,"contains a trace of passion or of power, or is of the slightest value"
17298,NOTES.,whatever. The fact that the poet has here come within the circle of the
17299,NOTES.,inspirations of Yarrow cannot of itself be accepted as sufficient to
17300,NOTES.,explain a fact which is certainly a curious one. It is plain from more
17301,NOTES.,"than one citation or allusion that Wordsworth, in his _Yarrow Unvisited_"
17302,NOTES.,"and _Yarrow Visited_, had this poem quite as much in his eye as the"
17303,NOTES.,earlier ballads whose scene is laid on the banks of the same stream.

17307,NOTES.,beauty so peerless:--‘The Editor knows no sonnet more remarkable than
17308,NOTES.,this which records Cowper’s gratitude to the Lady whose affectionate
17309,NOTES.,care for many years gave what sweetness he could enjoy to a life
17310,NOTES.,radically wretched. Petrarch’s sonnets have a more ethereal grace and a
17311,NOTES.,"more perfect finish, Shakespeare’s more passion, Milton’s stand supreme"
17312,NOTES.,"in stateliness, Wordsworth’s in depth and delicacy. But Cowper’s unites"
17313,NOTES.,with an exquisiteness in the turn of thought which the ancients would
17314,NOTES.,"have called irony, an intensity of pathetic tenderness peculiar to his"
17315,NOTES.,loving and ingenuous nature.’

17317,NOTES.,"P. 201, No. clxii.--Gray, who esteemed Tickell ‘a poor short-winded"

17319,NOTES.,"ballad, however, of Colin and Lucy I always thought the prettiest in the"
17320,NOTES.,world.’ After some hesitation I have not thought it pretty enough for a
17321,NOTES.,place in this volume. It is otherwise with the poem for which I have
17322,NOTES.,"found room. Johnson’s censure of poems, whether praise or blame, carries"
17323,NOTES.,"no great weight with it; and when he says of this one, ‘nor is a more"
17324,NOTES.,sublime or more elegant funeral poem to be found in the whole compass of
17325,NOTES.,"English literature,’ the praise is extravagant. Still it has real"

17402,NOTES.,"presently been forgotten, instead of taking as it has now done its place"
17403,NOTES.,"among the noblest lyrics, the trumpet-notes in the language. But indeed"
17404,NOTES.,this willingness to sacrifice parts to the interests of the whole is a
17405,NOTES.,"condition without which no great poem, least of all a great lyric poem,"
17406,NOTES.,"which is absolutely dependent for its effects on rapidity of movement,"
17407,NOTES.,can be written; and those who would fain escape the inevitable doom of
17408,NOTES.,oblivion which awaits almost all verse will do well to keep ever in
17409,NOTES.,remembrance how immeasurably more in poetry the half will sometimes be
17410,NOTES.,than the whole.
17411,NOTES.,
17412,NOTES.,"P. 265, No. ccxiv.--There is a mistake here, into which it is curious"
17413,NOTES.,that one who had watched so closely as Scott had done the struggle with
17414,NOTES.,Republican and Imperial France should have fallen. It was not Marengo
17415,NOTES.,"(1800) but Austerlitz (1805) which did so much to kill Pitt, and with"
17416,NOTES.,"which is connected the anecdote of his last days here referred to, and"
17417,NOTES.,"thus related by Lord Stanhope: ‘On leaving his carriage, as he passed"
17418,NOTES.,"along the passage to his bedroom [at Putney, which he never left], he"
17419,NOTES.,observed a map of Europe which had been drawn down from the wall; upon
17420,NOTES.,"which he turned to his niece, and mournfully said, “Roll up that map; it"
17421,NOTES.,"will not be wanted these ten years.”’ (_Life of Pitt_, vol. iv. p. 369.)"
17422,NOTES.,
17423,NOTES.,"P. 266, No. ccxv.--After the battle of Novara, which had virtually"
17424,NOTES.,"decided the conflict for a time, but before peace was signed between"
17425,NOTES.,"Austria and Piedmont, the inhabitants of Brescia rose against their"
17426,NOTES.,"Austrian garrison, March 21, 1849. They were crushed after a gallant"
17427,NOTES.,"struggle, but one which had been hopeless from the first."
17428,NOTES.,
17429,NOTES.,"P. 277, No. ccxix.--This poem is full of allusions to the tragical"
17430,NOTES.,issues of Shelley’s first rash and ill-considered marriage--issues which
17431,NOTES.,must have filled him ever after with very deep self-reproach. Far too
17432,NOTES.,slight as the expression of this is here--indeed it is hardly here at
17433,NOTES.,all--we know from other sources that the retrospect was one which went
17434,NOTES.,far to darken his whole after life. This serious fault has not hindered
17435,NOTES.,"me from quoting these lines, in many respects of an exquisite tenderness"
17436,NOTES.,"and beauty, and possessing that deep interest which autobiography must"
17437,NOTES.,always possess. One stanza has been omitted.
17438,NOTES.,
17439,NOTES.,"P. 291, No. ccxxiv.--These lines, written in Greece, and only three"
17440,NOTES.,"months before his death, are the last which Byron wrote, and, in their"
17441,NOTES.,"earlier stanzas at least, about the truest. In many of his smaller poems"
17442,NOTES.,"of passion, and in _Childe Harold_ itself, there is a _falsetto_ which"
17443,NOTES.,strikes painfully on the ear of the mind. But it is quite otherwise with
17444,NOTES.,"these deeply pathetic lines, in which the spoiled child of this world"
17445,NOTES.,passes judgment on that whole life of self-pleasing which he had laid
17446,NOTES.,"out for himself, and declares what had been the mournful end of it all."
17447,NOTES.,
17448,NOTES.,"P. 315, No. ccxlvii.--This, if I mistake not, is the only poem by"
17449,NOTES.,Herbert Knowles which survives. It appeared first in _The Quarterly
17450,NOTES.,"Review_, vol. ii. p. 396, with this account of the writer: ‘His life had"
17451,NOTES.,"been eventful and unfortunate, till his extraordinary merits were"
17452,NOTES.,discovered by persons capable of appreciating and willing and able to
17453,NOTES.,"assist him. He was then placed under a kind and able instructor, and"
17454,NOTES.,arrangements had been made for supporting him at the University; but he
17455,NOTES.,had not enjoyed that prospect many weeks before it pleased God to remove
17456,NOTES.,him to a better world. The reader will remember that they are the verses
17457,NOTES.,"of a schoolboy, who had not long been taken from one of the lowest"
17458,NOTES.,"stations of life, and he will then judge what might have been expected"
17459,NOTES.,from one who was capable of writing with such strength and originality
17460,NOTES.,"upon the tritest of all subjects.’ It was Southey, I believe, who wrote"
17461,NOTES.,"thus, in whose estimate of these verses I entirely concur; as it was he"
17462,NOTES.,"who was prepared to befriend the youthful poet, if he had not passed so"
17463,NOTES.,soon beyond the reach and need of human help.
17464,NOTES.,
17465,NOTES.,"P. 326, No. cclvii.--It is not a little remarkable that one to whom"
17466,NOTES.,"English was an acquired language, who can have had little or no"
17467,NOTES.,"experience in the mechanism of English verse, should yet have left us"
17468,NOTES.,"what Coleridge does not hesitate to call, ‘the finest and most grandly"
17469,NOTES.,"conceived sonnet in our language’--words, it is true, which he slightly"
17470,NOTES.,"modifies by adding, ‘at least it is only in Milton and in Wordsworth"
17471,NOTES.,that I remember any rival.’
17472,NOTES.,
17473,NOTES.,"P. 352, No. cclxxii.--This poem is drawn from a small volume with the"
17474,NOTES.,"title, _David and Samuel, with other Poems_, published in the year 1859."
17475,NOTES.,Much in the volume has no right to claim exemption from the doom which
17476,NOTES.,before very long awaits all verse except the very best. Yet one or two
17477,NOTES.,"poems have caught excellently well the tone, half serious, half"
17478,NOTES.,"ironical, of Goethe’s lighter pieces; while more than one of the more"
17479,NOTES.,"uniformly serious, this above all, seem to me to have remarkable merit."
17480,NOTES.,"It finds its motive, as I need hardly say, in the resolution of the"
17481,NOTES.,"Dutch, when their struggle with the overwhelming might of Louis XIV. and"
17482,NOTES.,"his satellite Charles II. seemed hopeless, to leave in mass their old"
17483,NOTES.,"home, and to found another Holland among their possessions in the"
17484,NOTES.,Eastern world.
17485,NOTES.,
17486,NOTES.,"P. 354, No. cclxxiii.--During the last Chinese war the following passage"
17487,NOTES.,"occurred in a letter of the Correspondent of _The Times_: ‘Some Seiks,"
17488,NOTES.,"and a private of the Buffs, having remained behind with the grog-carts,"
17489,NOTES.,"fell into the hands of the Chinese. On the next morning, they were"
17490,NOTES.,"brought before the authorities, and commanded to perform the kotou. The"
17491,NOTES.,"Seiks obeyed; but Moyse, the English soldier, declaring that he would"
17492,NOTES.,"not prostrate himself before any Chinaman alive, was immediately knocked"
17493,NOTES.,"upon the head, and his body thrown on a dunghill.’"
17494,NOTES.,
17495,NOTES.,"P. 356, No. cclxxiv.--Turner’s fine picture of the Téméraire, a grand"
17496,NOTES.,"old man-of-war (it had been, as its name indicates, taken from the"
17497,NOTES.,"French) towed into port by a little ugly steamer, that so, after all its"
17498,NOTES.,"noble toils, it might there be broken up, is itself a poem of a very"
17499,NOTES.,"high order, which has here been finely transferred into verse."
17500,NOTES.,
17501,NOTES.,"P. 359, No. cclxxviii.--A selection of Walt Whitman’s poetry has very"
17502,NOTES.,"lately been published in England, the editor of this declaring that in"
17503,NOTES.,him American poetry properly so-called begins. I must entirely dissent
17504,NOTES.,"from this statement. What he has got to say is a very old story indeed,"
17505,NOTES.,"and no one would have attended to his version of it, if he had not put"
17506,NOTES.,it more uncouthly than others before him. That there is no contradiction
17507,NOTES.,"between higher and lower, that there is no holy and no profane, that the"
17508,NOTES.,flesh has just as good rights as the spirit--this has never wanted
17509,NOTES.,"prophets to preach it, nor people to act upon it; and this is the"
17510,NOTES.,sum-total of his message to America and to the world. I was glad to find
17511,NOTES.,in his _Drum-taps_ one little poem which I could quote with real
17512,NOTES.,pleasure.

17530,NOTES.,way into any English anthology--but will share the admiration which I
17531,NOTES.,cannot refuse to express for many among them. It is true that they are
17532,NOTES.,"not always racy of the soil, that sometimes they only do what has been"
17533,NOTES.,"as well done, though scarcely better, in the old land; but whether we"
17534,NOTES.,"regard the perfect mechanism of the verse, the purity and harmony of the"
17535,NOTES.,"diction, the gracious thoughts so gracefully embodied, these poems, by"
